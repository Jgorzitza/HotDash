🚨 RELIABILITY AGENT - PAUSED
CEO Decision: 2025-10-11T22:50Z
=================================================================

STATUS: ⏸️ PAUSED - Standing by for launch gates completion

REASON: Emergency refocus on launch gates (Engineer, QA, Designer, Deployment)

RESUME: After all 7 launch gates complete (~48-72 hours)

=================================================================
NORTH STAR DEVIATION ACKNOWLEDGED
=================================================================

North Star: "Trustworthy, operator-first control center embedded 
inside Shopify Admin"

Deviation: Created extensive Agent SDK infrastructure runbooks for 
services that don't exist yet, instead of focusing on launch-blocking 
Shopify Admin deployment issues.

Lesson Learned: 
- Always check tasks against North Star before executing
- Ask "Does this unblock launch?" before creating documentation
- Prioritize working code over preparatory runbooks
- Focus on "operator-first Shopify Admin" not "perfect infrastructure"

Commitment: Will flag North Star drift in future feedback to keep 
manager accountable.
