# Daily Template Review - 2025-10-11

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-11 01:18 UTC  
**Reviewer**: Support Agent  
**Scope**: Chatwoot templates and macros

## Current Template Inventory

### Active Templates (3)
1. **ack_delay** - General inquiry acknowledgment with delay notice
2. **ship_update** - Shipping status update template
3. **refund_offer** - Refund/store credit options for dissatisfaction

## Review Findings

### Template Quality Assessment
- All current templates maintain professional tone ✓
- No legacy tool references (Zoho, etc.) ✓
- Proper variable usage with {{name}} placeholders ✓
- Sentiment alignment: empathetic, proactive, solution-oriented ✓

### Identified Gaps - Template Expansion Opportunities

Based on common support patterns, recommending three additional templates:

#### 1. Order Status Template
**Category**: Order inquiry  
**Use case**: Customer checking order progress  
**Proposed content**: "Hi {{name}}, I've located your order #{{order_id}}. It's currently {{status}} and expected to {{timeline}}. I'll send updates as it progresses."

#### 2. Follow-up Template
**Category**: Proactive communication  
**Use case**: Checking back after issue resolution  
**Proposed content**: "Hi {{name}}, following up on your recent inquiry. Has everything been resolved to your satisfaction? Please let me know if you need anything else."

#### 3. Policy Exception Template
**Category**: Special circumstances  
**Use case**: When policy flexibility is needed  
**Proposed content**: "Hi {{name}}, I understand this situation is unique. Let me check what options we have available and get back to you with a solution."

## Workflow Alignment Check

### RR7 Compatibility
- Templates use standard variable syntax compatible with React Router 7 ✓
- No framework-specific dependencies ✓

### CLI v3 Integration
- Templates stored in standard format for CLI ingestion ✓
- NDJSON format maintained for LlamaIndex compatibility ✓

## Recommendations

1. **Expand template library** with the three identified templates
2. **Implement A/B testing** for template effectiveness
3. **Create template versioning** system for iterative improvement
4. **Set up usage analytics** to track most effective templates
