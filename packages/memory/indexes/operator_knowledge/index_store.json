Social Sentiment POC\n\n- **Date / Time:** 2025-10-09 @ 17:00 UTC\n- **Participants:** Integrations (lead), Reliability (Arturo Vega), Marketing Ops (Madison Lee), Compliance (observer)\n- **Objective:** Align on rate-limit guardrails, monitoring signals, and fallback triggers before enabling the Hootsuite sentiment POC.\n\n## Pre-Reads & Inputs\n- `docs/integrations/social_sentiment_vendor_recommendation.md` ‚Äî vendor decision & contingency plan\n- `docs/integrations/hootsuite_contract_checklist.md` ‚Äî contractual and compliance dependencies\n- `artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/` ‚Äî evidence placeholders (populate as documents arrive)\n- Vendor ticket HS-44721 ‚Äî awaiting official rate-limit & SLA document\n\n## Working Assumptions (to validate in meeting)\n| Scenario | Rate-Limit Assumption | Monitoring Target | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hootsuite POC | Vendor to confirm; provisional budget 10 req/sec burst, 600 req/min steady | Alert at ‚â•80% of limit sustained 60s; capture 200/429 response mix | Derived from manager guidance; replace with contract values once HS-44721 returns. |\n| X Premium (contingency) | 1M tweets/month (approx. 23 req/min sustained) | Alert on 75% monthly consumption + per-minute spikes | Requires budget approval before activation. |\n| Meta Graph (contingency) | 200 calls/hour/user without Business verification | Alert when >150 calls/hour; track 4xx errors | Business verification may raise ceiling; confirm before pivot. |\n\n## Agenda\n1. **Status checkpoint (5 min)**\n   - Confirm HS-44721 ticket state, artifact delivery timeline, and compliance review blockers.\n2. **Rate-limit validation (10 min)**\n   - Replace provisional thresholds with vendor-provided numbers (if available).\n   - Identify gaps requiring follow-up (e.g., burst vs sustained limits, concurrent connection caps).\n3. **Instrumentation plan (10 min)**\n   - Define metrics to collect (`req/sec`, `429 count`, latency, sentiment processing lag).\n   - Map logging locations (`packages/integrations/social/hootsuiteClient.ts`, dashboard tile consumer).\n4. **Alerting & escalation ladder (10 min)**\n   - Configure Grafana/Prometheus thresholds aligned with guardrails.\n   - Assign on-call response: Reliability first, escalate to Integrations + Marketing.\n5. **Fallback path review (10 min)**\n   - Validate mock sentiment toggle and native API contingency readiness.\n   - Capture data retention implications when switching feeds.\n6. **Action summary (5 min)**\n   - Owners, due dates, evidence to attach in `feedback/integrations.md` and artifact folder.\n\n## Expected Outputs\n- Finalized rate-limit threshold table (to replace assumptions above).\n- Monitoring checklist added to `docs/runbooks/secret_rotation.md` or equivalent reliability runbook.\n- Action items recorded in `feedback/integrations.md` with due dates.\n\n## Open Questions\n- Can Hootsuite expose per-endpoint rate-limit headers or do we rely on support cases?\n- Does Reliability need synthetic traffic for canary checks, or will production usage suffice?\n- What storage duration is acceptable for raw social payloads within monitoring systems (align with compliance)?\n\n## Next Steps\n- Update agenda table once HS-44721 response arrives (owner: Integrations).\n- Share meeting notes with participants within 2 hours post-sync.\n- Feed confirmed thresholds into contract checklist and monitoring automation tickets.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":3586,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AbKoLr8wAU1Spiy7eRe21zx6qMzDLY4vBEi3v37r+Ho="},"7ab3fb25-2ffb-49ae-a15e-dfe40d1aa524":{"id_":"7ab3fb25-2ffb-49ae-a15e-dfe40d1aa524","metadata":{"source":"docs/integrations/shopify_credential_broadcast_2025-10-10.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.323Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/integrations/shopify_credential_broadcast_2025-10-10.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/integrations/shopify_credential_broadcast_2025-10-10.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.323Z"},"hash":"6tN/e3tBMBCZoEDHI8+fE8Y5yFkPE5Yvp29mCd78QSg="}},"text":"---\nepoch:

Native APIs remain strategically important for long-term cost control and data ownership.\n- **Stakeholder alignment:** Marketing favors rapid sentiment signal delivery for campaign monitoring; Reliability requires clear rate-limit + alerting guarantees; Compliance needs DPA terms covering EU data residency.\n\n## Vendor Comparison Snapshot\n| Dimension | Hootsuite (Shopify App) | Native APIs (X Premium + Meta Graph) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Coverage** | X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok via a single API | Requires stitching X + Meta (Instagram/Facebook); LinkedIn unavailable without additional partnership |\n| **Sentiment Analysis** | Built-in classifier + anomaly alerts | Requires third-party NLP (e.g., AWS Comprehend) or manual model |\n| **Time-to-Integrate** | 1-2 weeks (OAuth via Shopify App + typed client wrapper) | 4-6 weeks (OAuth flows, webhook handling, NLP pipeline, rate-limit management) |\n| **Monthly Cost (est.)** | $99 Professional tier (one seat) | ~$100 (X Premium) + infra costs for NLP + maintenance |\n| **Rate Limits** | Vendor-managed; SLA required (target ‚â•10 req/sec burst) | X Premium: 1M tweets/month; Meta: 200 calls/hour/user without Business verification |\n| **Data Ownership** | Limited to data returned by Hootsuite API; subject to vendor retention policies | Direct access (subject to platform ToS); full control over storage/retention |\n| **Engineering Effort** | Low ‚Äî typed wrapper + fallback handling | High ‚Äî separate clients, storage, NLP, monitoring |\n| **Risk Profile** | Vendor lock-in, dependency on Shopify app availability | Higher ongoing maintenance, compliance with multiple platform policies |\n\n## Recommendation & Next Steps\n1. **Launch POC on Hootsuite**\n   - Build typed client in `packages/integrations/social/hootsuiteClient.ts` with sentiment + mention fetch methods.\n   - Coordinate with Reliability to define rate-limit guardrails (alert at 80% of vendor limits; integrate with `docs/data/data_quality_monitoring.md`).\n   - Instrument fallback to mock sentiment data to preserve dashboard continuity if Hootsuite API degrades.\n2. **Negotiate Contract Terms**\n   - Request Professional tier discount for single-store usage; ensure SLA references HotDash outage credits.\n   - Confirm data retention window (target ‚â§90 days) and ability to purge data upon request.\n   - Verify vendor provides DPAs covering EU/UK processors; escalate gaps to Compliance.\n   - Track deliverables in `docs/integrations/hootsuite_contract_checklist.md` and package evidence for Compliance by 2025-10-09.\n3. **Plan Native API Track (Contingency)**\n   - Marketing to prepare budget estimate for X Premium + AWS Comprehend if Hootsuite cost scales beyond $250/month.\n   - Reliability to prototype rate-limit monitoring scripts for X + Meta (re-usable even within Hootsuite fallback scenario).\n   - Integrations to maintain contract requirements for native APIs (OAuth scopes, webhook URLs) so we can pivot within one sprint if vendor access changes.\n\n## Contract Considerations\n### Hootsuite\n- **Agreements:** Shopify App Terms + Hootsuite Enterprise Agreement; request security addendum covering SOC2 & GDPR posture.\n- **Compliance Hooks:** Ensure DPIA lists Hootsuite as processor; audit log export cadence (weekly) retained in `artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/`.\n- **Access Control:** Limit OAuth scope to required read-only sentiment endpoints; rotate app token every 90 days (align with secret rotation plan).\n- **Support SLAs:** Seek 99.5% uptime commitment with 4-hour critical response; add clause requiring 30-day notice before API breaking changes.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4294,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jhRI69mMtBRX6sZ+t/ItAplNLLrTETvs5Fx4AtxseYo="},"793aae9d-1cbe-4d36-95e5-246620c0dcc6":{"id_":"793aae9d-1cbe-4d36-95e5-246620c0dcc6","metadata":{"source":"docs/integrations/social_sentiment_vendor_recommendation.md","lastModified":"2025-10-09T21:06:56.732Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/integrations/social_sentiment_vendor_recommendation.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/integrations/social_sentiment_vendor_recommendation.md","lastModified":"2025-10-09T21:06:56.732Z"},"hash":"Kbuz77UPhSIVoRLLB+hhbe4Lvy+sg22aMIGE6diX/YY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"05a71085-5574-4870-8ce9-a7964ac03490","metadata":{"source":"docs/integrations/social_sentiment_vendor_recommendation.md","lastModified":"2025-10-09T21:06:56.732Z"},"hash":"BGrdT12xRzfZNwO9N1b42MTFQKzeqY2+944J458BywQ="}},"text":"- Reliability to prototype rate-limit monitoring scripts for X + Meta (re-usable even within Hootsuite fallback scenario).\n   - Integrations to maintain contract requirements for native APIs (OAuth scopes, webhook URLs) so we can pivot within one sprint if vendor access changes.\n\n## Contract Considerations\n### Hootsuite\n- **Agreements:** Shopify App Terms + Hootsuite Enterprise Agreement; request security addendum covering SOC2 & GDPR posture.\n- **Compliance Hooks:** Ensure DPIA lists Hootsuite as processor; audit log export cadence (weekly) retained in `artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/`.\n- **Access Control:** Limit OAuth scope to required read-only sentiment endpoints; rotate app token every 90 days (align with secret rotation plan).\n- **Support SLAs:** Seek 99.5% uptime commitment with 4-hour critical response; add clause requiring 30-day notice before API breaking changes.\n\n### Native APIs\n- **X Premium:** Requires detailed use case submission; ensure monitoring of elevated rate limits to avoid automated suspension. Contract must address content moderation obligations and storage retention (<30 days for tweets if user deletes content).\n- **Meta Graph:** Business Verification necessary for advanced metrics; platform policy requires public privacy policy + user deletion endpoint (coordinate with Product/Legal).\n- **NLP Add-on:** If AWS Comprehend is used, confirm cost center + data residency (us-east-1) meet compliance expectations; create data destruction workflow for sentiment artifacts older than 180 days.\n\n## Alignment Log\n| Date | Stakeholder | Summary | Follow-up |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2025-10-07 | Madison Lee (Marketing PM) | Reviewed POC scope; marketing approved Hootsuite-first plan due to time-to-insight. | Provide vendor contract draft by 2025-10-09. |\n| 2025-10-07 | Arturo Vega (Reliability) | Confirmed need for explicit rate-limit metrics + alert thresholds before production. | Send proposed monitoring spec once Hootsuite API docs received. |\n| 2025-10-07 | Casey Lin (Compliance) | Requested vendor DPIA inputs (Data categories, storage region, subcontractors). | Deliver questionnaire summary with contract packet. |\n| 2025-10-08 | Casey Lin (Compliance) | Scheduled DPIA review for 2025-10-09 16:00 UTC; awaiting evidence bundle. | Share artifact package prior to meeting. |\n| 2025-10-08 | Arturo Vega (Reliability) | Booked sentiment monitoring sync for 2025-10-09 17:00 UTC (pending vendor rate-limit doc). | Draft monitoring agenda once documentation arrives. |\n\n## Open Questions\n- Awaiting Hootsuite API rate-limit documentation; requested from vendor support (ticket HS-44721).\n- Need Shopify App security review template‚Äîcheck with Security agent if previous app assessments exist.\n- Confirm whether marketing requires LinkedIn coverage in POC or can defer to Phase 2B.\n\n## Reporting Commitments\n- Publish POC readiness update in `feedback/integrations.md` once contract terms finalized.\n- Capture contract artifacts under `docs/integrations/vendor_contracts/hootsuite/` (create folder post-signature).\n- Revisit recommendation during 2025-10-14 sprint planning with adoption metrics and vendor response times.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":3410,"endCharIdx":6581,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"H3s+EL2esPB+JMsfPuZ3x6SGf8MRpBSTyMXzIO6kTQk="}},"type":"simple_dict"}}}
