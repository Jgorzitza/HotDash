Check minimum bend radius for your hose size:\n   - AN-6: 2.5\" minimum\n   - AN-8: 3.0\" minimum\n   - AN-10: 3.5\" minimum\n2. Use 45° or 90° fittings to avoid sharp bends\n3. Order longer hose if needed\n4. Replace kinked hose (do not attempt to straighten)\n\n**Prevention:** Plan routing before cutting hose, use angled fittings\n\n---\n\n### Issue: Hose End is Frayed or Damaged\n**Symptoms:** Loose braiding, exposed inner liner, difficult fitting assembly\n\n**Causes:**\n- Cut with wrong tool\n- Dull cutting blade\n- Too much force during cutting\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Use proper AN hose cutting shears (Hot Rod AN Part #: HRA-CUT-001)\n2. Make clean, straight cuts\n3. Trim away any loose braiding with sharp scissors\n4. If inner PTFE liner is damaged, cut 1/2\" off and retry\n\n**Prevention:** Always use sharp, proper cutting tools designed for braided hose\n\n---\n\n### Issue: Hose is Stiff or Hard to Route\n**Symptoms:** Difficult to bend, resists installation\n\n**Causes:**\n- Cold temperature (PTFE becomes stiffer)\n- Brand new hose (not broken in)\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Warm hose to room temperature before installation\n2. Gently flex hose back and forth to increase flexibility\n3. Use heat gun on LOW setting (max 150°F) for 30 seconds if needed\n4. Consider using nylon braided hose instead of stainless for tighter bends\n\n**Note:** PTFE hose stiffness is normal and does not affect performance\n\n---\n\n## AN Fitting Problems\n\n### Issue: Fitting Won't Thread onto Hose End\n**Symptoms:** Fitting stops before fully engaging, cross-threading\n\n**Causes:**\n- Fitting and hose sizes don't match\n- Ferrule not seated properly\n- Cross-threaded during initial assembly\n- Wrong fitting type (ORB vs. AN)\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Verify sizes match:\n   - AN-6 hose = AN-6 fittings\n   - AN-8 hose = AN-8 fittings\n   - AN-10 hose = AN-10 fittings\n2. Ensure ferrule is pushed all the way onto hose\n3. Start threads by hand - never force with wrench\n4. Check for cross-threading - back out and restart\n5. Use proper assembly technique (see installation guide)\n\n**Prevention:** Double-check part numbers before installation, thread by hand first\n\n---\n\n### Issue: Fitting Leaks After Installation\n**Symptoms:** Fuel/fluid dripping from fitting connection\n\n**Causes:**\n- Under-torqued fitting\n- Over-torqued fitting (damaged threads or seal)\n- Missing or damaged O-ring (ORB fittings)\n- Improper assembly\n- Thread sealant used where not needed\n\n**Solutions:**\n1.

Check if fitting is fully engaged before torquing\n\n**Prevention:** Follow proper torque specs, use new O-rings, avoid over-tightening\n\n---\n\n### Issue: Fitting Seized or Won't Come Apart\n**Symptoms:** Cannot remove fitting, stuck threads\n\n**Causes:**\n- Over-torqued during installation\n- Corrosion from dissimilar metals\n- Thread galling (aluminum to aluminum)\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Apply penetrating oil and let sit overnight\n2. Use heat (150-200°F max) to expand fitting\n3. Use proper size wrench - do not round off hex\n4. Apply steady pressure while turning (no jerking)\n5. For seized ORB fittings, replace the fitting\n\n**Prevention:** Use anti-seize on aluminum threads, follow torque specs\n\n---\n\n## Fuel Pump Issues\n\n### Issue: Fuel Pump Not Priming\n**Symptoms:** No fuel flow when key turned on, no pump sound\n\n**Causes:**\n- No power to pump\n- Blown fuse\n- Faulty relay\n- Bad ground connection\n- Pump failure\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Check fuse box for blown pump fuse\n2. Test for 12V at pump connector with key on\n3. Check ground connection (clean and tight)\n4. Listen for pump prime (2-3 second whir when key turned on)\n5. Bypass relay to test pump directly\n6. If no sound and 12V present, pump may be bad\n\n**Prevention:** Use proper gauge wiring, ensure clean connections\n\n---\n\n### Issue: Low Fuel Pressure\n**Symptoms:** Engine runs lean, pressure gauge reads low\n\n**Causes:**\n- Clogged fuel filter\n- Weak pump\n- Voltage drop (undersized wiring)\n- Restricted fuel line\n- Regulator set too low\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Replace fuel filter (first step)\n2. Check voltage at pump under load (should be 13-14V)\n3. Verify fuel line size is adequate:\n   - EFI systems: -6 AN minimum (return style)\n   - EFI systems: -8 AN minimum (returnless)\n4. Check regulator settings\n5. Test pump output with pressure gauge\n\n**Common Filter Replacement:** Every 10,000 miles or annually\n\n---\n\n### Issue: Fuel Pump is Noisy\n**Symptoms:** Whining, grinding, or loud humming\n\n**Causes:**\n- Low fuel level (cavitation)\n- Clogged pre-filter/sock\n- Air in fuel system\n- Failing pump\n- Pump not submerged (in-tank pumps)\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Keep fuel tank over 1/4 full\n2. Check pre-filter/sock for debris\n3. Bleed air from fuel system\n4. Verify pump is fully submerged (in-tank)\n5. If noise persists, pump may be failing\n\n**Prevention:** Regular filter changes, keep tank above 1/4 full\n\n---\n\n## Leak Detection & Resolution\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Leak\n- Wipe area clean and dry\n- Turn on fuel pump (key on, engine off)\n- Watch for fuel seepage\n- Check all fittings, connections, and hose ends\n- Use paper towel to find small leaks\n\n### Step 2: Identify Leak Type\n\n**Fitting Connection Leak:**\n- Tighten to proper torque spec\n- If still leaking, disassemble and inspect\n- Look for damaged threads or cross-threading\n\n**Hose End Leak:**\n- Check if ferrule is properly seated\n- Verify fitting is fully engaged on hose\n- Replace if hose is damaged at connection\n\n**O-Ring Leak (ORB Fittings):**\n- Inspect O-ring for damage\n- Replace O-ring\n- Lubricate new O-ring before assembly\n\n**Hose Body Leak:**\n- Inspect for punctures or cuts\n- Check for kinks causing pressure buildup\n- Replace hose section if damaged\n\n### Step 3: Fix and Retest\n1. Make repair\n2. Wipe area clean again\n3. Pressurize system\n4. Check for leaks\n5. Run engine and recheck at operating pressure\n6.",

          "text": "# Exchange Process - Hot Rod AN LLC\n\n**Last Updated:** October 2025\n\n## Overview\n\nNeed a different size, color, or style? We make exchanges easy! Whether you need a different AN size, hose color, fitting angle, or want to upgrade your parts, our exchange process is simple and fast.\n\n---\n\n## Why Exchange Instead of Return?\n\n**Benefits of Exchanges:**\n- ✅ **No Restocking Fee** (normally 15% on returns)\n- ✅ **Faster Processing** (new item ships immediately)\n- ✅ **Priority Handling** (exchanges processed first)\n- ✅ **Free Shipping on Exchanges** (within same price range)\n- ✅ **Keep Your Project Moving** (less downtime)\n\n---\n\n## Exchange Eligibility\n\n### What Can Be Exchanged ✅\n\n**Full Exchange (Any Time Within 30 Days)**\n- Unopened PTFE hose in original sealed packaging\n- Unused AN fittings and adapters\n- Tools in original packaging\n- Fuel pumps in sealed boxes\n- Any unused item in original condition\n\n**Limited Exchange (Case-by-Case)**\n- Bundle deals (if most items unused)\n- Large orders (contact us first)\n- Special orders (may have restrictions)\n\n### What Cannot Be Exchanged ❌\n- Custom-cut hose or custom-length items\n- Used or installed fittings (safety concern)\n- Electrical items that have been wired\n- Items without original packaging\n- Clearance or final sale items\n- Items older than 30 days (unless defective)\n- Damaged items (except manufacturer defects)\n\n---\n\n## Common Exchange Scenarios\n\n### 1. Different Hose Color\n**Example:** Ordered black hose but want blue  \n**Process:** Standard exchange - no additional cost  \n**Turnaround:** New hose ships same day we receive return\n\n**Popular Color Swaps:**\n- Black → Blue\n- Black → Red  \n- Black → Purple\n- Stainless → Nylon braided\n\n**Note:** All color options available in AN-6, AN-8, and AN-10 sizes\n\n---\n\n### 2. Different AN Size\n**Example:** Ordered AN-6 but need AN-8  \n**Process:** Price difference exchange  \n**Additional Cost:** Pay difference if upgrading, credit if downgrading\n\n**Common Size Changes:**\n- AN-6 → AN-8 (larger fuel pump, higher HP)\n- AN-10 → AN-8 (easier to route, lighter weight)\n- AN-8 → AN-10 (supporting 800+ HP builds)\n\n**Price Differences:**\n- AN-6 to AN-8: Usually $2-5 per foot\n- AN-8 to AN-10: Usually $3-7 per foot\n\n---\n\n### 3. Different Fitting Angle\n**Example:** Ordered straight fitting but need 45°  \n**Process:** Standard exchange  \n**Cost:** Usually no additional cost (same price range)\n\n**Popular Angle Swaps:**\n- Straight → 45° (tight engine bay routing)\n- Straight → 90° (around firewall)\n- 45° → 90° (sharper turn needed)\n\n**Tip:** Take photos of your installation area and email us - we can recommend best angles!\n\n---\n\n### 4. Upgrade to Better Product\n**Example:** Ordered Walbro 255 LPH but want Aeromotive 340 LPH  \n**Process:** Upgrade exchange  \n**Cost:** Pay price difference plus any shipping difference\n\n**Popular Upgrades:**\n- Nylon hose → Stainless braided (+$8/ft)\n- Inline fuel filter → Corvette-style filter/regulator combo\n- Basic pump → High-flow pump\n- Standard fitting pack → Bundle deal (better value)\n\n---\n\n### 5. Bundle Modification\n**Example:** Ordered AN-6 bundle but one component needs to be AN-8  \n**Process:** Contact us - we'll work it out  \n**Cost:** Usually just price difference on swapped item\n\n---\n\n## Exchange Process\n\n### Step 1: Contact Us\n**Before Shipping Anything Back:**\n1. Email support@hotrodan.com with:\n   - Order number\n   - Item(s) you want to exchange\n   - Item(s) you want instead\n   - Reason for exchange (optional)\n\n2.

They use a **flare seal** design, not a thread seal. Using sealant can cause leaks and damage.\n\n**DO use sealant on:**\n- NPT fittings (tapered pipe threads)\n- Not on AN (straight threads with flare)\n\n---\n\n### Q14: How tight should I make AN fittings?\n**A:** Torque specifications:\n- **AN-6:** 25-30 ft-lbs\n- **AN-8:** 30-35 ft-lbs\n- **AN-10:** 35-40 ft-lbs\n\nAssembly tip: Hand-tighten until snug, then use wrench to turn an additional 1/4 to 1/2 turn. Do NOT over-tighten!\n\n---\n\n### Q15: My fitting is leaking - what should I do?\n**A:** Check these common causes:\n1. **Under-torqued:** Tighten to proper torque spec\n2. **Over-torqued:** Disassemble, inspect for damage, reassemble\n3. **Cross-threaded:** Disassemble, start threads by hand carefully\n4. **Missing O-ring:** For ORB fittings, check O-ring is present and lubricated\n5. **Damaged flare:** Inspect hose end for damage\n\nSee our [Product Troubleshooting Guide](product-troubleshooting.md) for detailed help.\n\n---\n\n### Q16: Can I cut the hose to custom length?\n**A:** Yes! Our hose is sold by the foot and you can cut it to any length you need. \n\n**Important:**\n- Use proper AN hose cutting shears (never a knife or regular scissors)\n- Cut straight across, not at an angle\n- Custom-cut hose cannot be returned (safety policy)\n\n**Tip:** Measure carefully and add 2-3 inches extra for fitting installation.\n\n---\n\n### Q17: What's the minimum bend radius for PTFE hose?\n**A:**\n- **AN-6:** 2.5\" minimum bend radius\n- **AN-8:** 3.0\" minimum bend radius\n- **AN-10:** 3.5\" minimum bend radius\n\nGoing below minimum radius will kink the hose and restrict flow. Use 45° or 90° fittings to avoid sharp bends!\n\n---\n\n### Q18: Will PTFE hose work with E85 fuel?\n**A:** Yes! PTFE (Teflon) is **100% compatible** with:\n- E85 and ethanol fuels\n- Gasoline (all grades)\n- Diesel\n- Methanol\n- Most racing fuels\n\nPTFE is the gold standard for fuel system compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Q19: Can I use this hose for brake lines, transmission coolers, or other applications?",
