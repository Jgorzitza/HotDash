Skip nothing—every item ensures the agent has the tools, secrets, and context to execute end-to-end.\n\n## 1. Canon Review\n- [ ] Confirm the agent has read:\n  - `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`\n  - `docs/git_protocol.md`\n  - `docs/directions/README.md`\n  - Their role file under `docs/directions/<role>.md`\n  - `docs/ops/credential_index.md`\n\n## 2. Credential Readiness\n- [ ] Source vault secrets required for the role (refer to `docs/ops/credential_index.md`).\n- [ ] Verify CLI auth for required tools:\n  - `gh auth status`\n  - `/home/justin/.fly/bin/fly auth status` (after sourcing `vault/occ/fly/api_token.env`)\n- [ ] Document the confirmation (command + timestamp) in the agent’s feedback file before launch.\n\n## 3. Evidence Gate Reminder\n- [ ] Reiterate: every feedback update must include command, timestamp, output path.\n- [ ] Confirm the agent has access to `artifacts/` directory to store logs/screenshots.\n\n## 4. Blocker Sweep\n- [ ] Review recent feedback for unresolved blockers tied to this role.\n- [ ] Ensure direction docs reflect latest decisions; if not, update before launch.\n\n## 5. Launch Approval\n- [ ] Manager signs off in `feedback/manager.md` with:\n  - Agent name\n  - Launch time\n  - Checklist confirmation\n- [ ] Notify the agent to begin, pointing them to their direction file and relevant runbooks.\n\nOnly after this checklist is complete may the agent start work. This process prevents stack drift, missing secrets, and ambiguous ownership.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1675,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"R7PczAawNSuUdPRa4BMeitSwrkwirFn4f7vXhhv+B3k="},"c1453e01-758b-4a2d-a8a3-2bfe4168004a":{"id_":"c1453e01-758b-4a2d-a8a3-2bfe4168004a","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.327Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.327Z"},"hash":"wo96zq4LXCQMvcIiVNPaILGpgYMOjQ/nRW9alc2o39c="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a00a5232-5550-48fd-bb31-761230651280","metadata":{},"hash":"Mgx5mC35OZ41ogdB6x7EpBdSNLnkX3sUfZoMoE81nk8="}},"text":"---\nepoch: 2025.10.E1\ndoc: docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md\nowner: support\nlast_reviewed: 2025-10-08\ndoc_hash: TBD\nexpires: 2025-10-20\n---\n# CX Escalations Runbook — Operator Control Center\n\n## Purpose\nMap each CX Escalations tile action to internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and escalation ladders. This runbook enables operators to handle customer conversations efficiently while maintaining quality and SLA compliance.\n\n**Support Inbox:** customer.support@hotrodan.com — archive escalations, smoke test evidence, and Chatwoot deployment updates here.\n\n---\n\n## Dashboard Actions & SOPs\n\n### Modal Screenshots (Mock Mode)\n![CX Escalation modal default state](images/cx_escalation_modal_overview.svg)\n![Success toast after approval](images/cx_escalation_modal_toast.svg)\n\n### 1. View Escalated Conversation\n**Dashboard UI:** CX Escalations tile displays list of conversations with SLA breach indicators\n\n**Operator Action:**\n- Click conversation in tile to open the CX Escalation modal\n- Review customer name, status, breach time, last message timestamp\n\n**SOP Mapping:**\n- **SOP-CX-001:** Conversation Triage Protocol\n  - Priority 1: SLA breached >2 hours → Immediate response required\n  - Priority 2: SLA breached <2 hours → Response within 30 minutes\n  - Priority 3: Tagged \"escalation\" but within SLA → Review within 1 hour\n\n**Escalation Ladder:**\n- L1: CX Agent (first response, template selection)\n- L2: CX Lead (escalation tag or complex issue)\n- L3: Operations Manager (refund >$500, policy exception)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Approve & Send Reply (AI Suggestion)\n**Dashboard UI:** Conversation detail modal with \"Suggested Reply (AI-generated)\" card\n\n**Operator Action:**\n- Review the AI-generated suggestion surfaced in the modal.\n- Confirm the greeting reflects the customer name (defaults to \"Customer\" if Chatwoot lacks profile data).\n- Edit the \"Operator Note\" field if extra context should be captured in the audit trail.\n- Click \"Approve & Send Reply\" → sends the suggestion to Chatwoot and logs the decision.\n\n**SOP Mapping:**\n- **SOP-CX-002:** Template Response Guidelines\n  - AI suggestion currently mirrors the `ack_delay` template; confirm tone and promise match the customer issue before approving.\n  - If the suggestion is not appropriate, escalate the conversation or handle directly in Chatwoot.\n- **Fallback:** When no suggestion is shown (missing `suggestedReply`), do **not** approve; escalate or reply in Chatwoot until template selector is available.\n\n**Decision Logging:**\n- Action: `chatwoot.approve_send`\n- Scope: `ops`\n- Metadata: conversationId, replyBody, operatorEmail, optional note\n\n**Escalation Criteria:**\n- Approved reply but no customer acknowledgement in 24h → Re-escalate to L2\n- Suggestion missing or customer requests manager → Escalate to L3 immediately\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Operators should still confirm tone before approving.\n\n## Chatwoot Fly Deployment Validation (Pre-Launch)\n\nWhen reliability signals the Fly deployment window, execute the following to confirm Chatwoot connectivity and dashboard handoffs:\n\n1. **Pre-Deployment Checklist**\n   - Confirm deployment notice in `#occ-reliability` and log the window in `feedback/support.md`.\n   - Download latest deployment playbook from reliability; note new Fly app hostname.\n   - Notify enablement + marketing via customer.support@hotrodan.com so comms and macros pause during the cutover.\n   - Update the smoke script `scripts/ops/chatwoot-fly-smoke.sh` with the announced Fly hostname and any refreshed API tokens (use `--env staging` to pull from vault defaults); record the values in `feedback/support.md` for audit.\n\n2. **During Deployment**\n   - Run `scripts/ops/chatwoot-fly-smoke.sh --env staging --host <fly-host>` (or pass `--token-file` with the deployment bundle) to capture recurring API probes; archive logs under `artifacts/support/chatwoot-fly-deploy/`.\n   - Validate OCC API proxy: launch CX Escalations tile in staging (`?mock=1`) and ensure conversation list responds within SLA (<2s). Log timestamp + request ID.\n   - Attempt modal actions (approve, escalate) in mock conversation; confirm decision logs write to Supabase without errors. If failures occur, escalate immediately via reliability bridge call.\n\n3. **Post-Deployment Smoke**\n   - Re-run tile load and modal actions against live conversation (if available) to ensure Chatwoot webhook responses succeed.\n   - Update escalation SOPs to reference the new Fly host (Chatwoot admin links, troubleshooting flow) and distribute summary through customer.support@hotrodan.com.\n   - Attach evidence (curl logs, screenshots, decision IDs) to `feedback/support.md` and notify manager once validation passes.\n\n### Template: `ack_delay`\n**Label:** Acknowledge delay\n**Body:**\n```\nHi {{name}}, thanks for your patience.

Introduction (10 minutes)\n**Objective:** Understand dashboard purpose and north star\n\n**Topics:**\n- Operator Control Center vision: single source of truth across CX, sales, inventory, SEO\n- Approval workflow paradigm: every action requires explicit operator decision\n- Decision logging: all actions tracked for audit trail (decision_log table)\n- Staging install overview: Operator Control Center lives inside Shopify Admin (`Apps -> HotDash`). Support briefs participants on staging credentials (see `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`) and verifies feature flags (`FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS`, `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS`) before kickoff.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Dashboard reduces tab fatigue by consolidating Shopify, Chatwoot, GA data\n- Mock mode vs. live mode: Start training in mock mode (`?mock=1`)\n- Evidence-based operations: every tile shows data source + refresh timestamp\n- Staging access verification: load `https://hotdash-stag{{ABBREV_2}}fly.dev/app?mock=1` ahead of the session; a 200 OK (or 302 to Shopify auth) is required. If you receive HTTP 410 or a network error, escalate to deployment/reliability immediately and document the outcome in `feedback/enablement.md`.\n- Staging evidence table: Supabase NDJSON entry is live (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`); monitor for the first green `?mock=0` run to swap in fresh curl + synthetic evidence (latest log `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/curl_mock0_2025-10-10T07-57-48Z.log` is still 410). Until QA posts the green run, keep rehearsals paused and only iterate on prep docs. Once evidence lands, refresh this agenda’s links and broadcast updates via customer.support@hotrodan.com.\n- Chatwoot Fly migration: monitor reliability announcements, keep `scripts/ops/chatwoot-fly-smoke.sh --env staging` ready with the latest host/token, and review `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md#chatwoot-fly-deployment-validation-pre-launch` so facilitators can brief operators the moment the new host goes live.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Dashboard Navigation (15 minutes)\n**Objective:** Tour the interface and understand tile layout\n\n**Walkthrough:**\n- Header: \"Operator Control Center\" heading, mock mode notice\n- Tile grid: 6 tiles in responsive layout (1280px desktop, 768px tablet)\n- Tile anatomy: Title, status indicator, metadata line, content area, action buttons (future)\n\n**Tiles Overview:**\n1. **Ops Pulse** — Activation rate, SLA resolution metrics (meta tile)\n2. **Sales Pulse** — Revenue, order count, top SKUs\n3. **Fulfillment Health** — Orders stuck in pending/processing, blockers\n4. **Inventory Heatmap** — Low stock alerts, days of cover\n5. **CX Escalations** — SLA breached conversations, escalation tags\n6. **SEO & Content Watch** — Landing pages with WoW session drops\n\n**Practice:**\n- Operators click through each tile\n- Identify status indicators (healthy, attention, error, unconfigured)\n- Confirm staging environment readiness: support lead walks through Shopify Admin login flow and staging credentials pre-check (demo shop domain, OCC staging URL with `?mock=1`, Supabase decision log access). Document confirmation in the Q&A template.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TjpKundbENpC5HH0u/u3Y2un1THxJFoSNFuzsL/MY60="},"b68dc14e-8102-423b-a34b-00fd22d8dfe1":{"id_":"b68dc14e-8102-423b-a34b-00fd22d8dfe1","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"viXJuVzrrVJ/Lft8cw/p6IcSrAiIfwhYoFMBGf1vj4U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4e084b49-5149-4cd8-a005-cdf52c54964c","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"TjpKundbENpC5HH0u/u3Y2un1THxJFoSNFuzsL/MY60="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d54a29f7-364d-4f91-9195-a540b481c44e","metadata":{},"hash":"CCaf9kfqoA3E583c0uxrvrSjFKf35D161hgJny9EV3Q="}},"text":"**Ops Pulse** — Activation rate, SLA resolution metrics (meta tile)\n2. **Sales Pulse** — Revenue, order count, top SKUs\n3. **Fulfillment Health** — Orders stuck in pending/processing, blockers\n4. **Inventory Heatmap** — Low stock alerts, days of cover\n5. **CX Escalations** — SLA breached conversations, escalation tags\n6. **SEO & Content Watch** — Landing pages with WoW session drops\n\n**Practice:**\n- Operators click through each tile\n- Identify status indicators (healthy, attention, error, unconfigured)\n- Confirm staging environment readiness: support lead walks through Shopify Admin login flow and staging credentials pre-check (demo shop domain, OCC staging URL with `?mock=1`, Supabase decision log access). Document confirmation in the Q&A template.\n- If Supabase telemetry is still syncing, rehearse using the sample IDs (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`, IDs 101–104) so facilitators can validate success, retry, and timeout scenarios before live data lands.\n\n**Q&A Capture:**\n- Any tile unclear or confusing?\n- What information is missing?\n- Any visual hierarchy issues?\n\n---\n\n### 3. CX Escalations Deep Dive (25 minutes)\n**Objective:** Master conversation triage and templated replies\n\n**Walkthrough:**\n- Tile shows list of conversations: customer name, status, SLA breach indicator\n- Click conversation name to open modal (if `FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS=true`)\n- Modal displays: customer name, conversation ID, created/breached timestamps, last message preview\n\n**Template Selection:**\n- Review 3 current templates: ack_delay, ship_update, refund_offer\n- Explain use cases per docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md\n- Show variable interpolation: {{name}} → customer name\n\n**Approval Flow:**\n- Select template from dropdown\n- Review pre-filled message body\n- Click \"Approve & Send Reply\" → logs decision + sends to Chatwoot\n- Toast confirmation: \"Reply sent to [Customer Name]\"\n\n**Escalation Actions:**\n- \"Escalate to Manager\" button → tags conversation, logs decision\n- Escalation SLA: Manager acknowledges within 2 hours\n\n**Practice Scenarios:**\n1. Customer asking about shipping delay → Use `ship_update` template\n2. Customer reports product defect → Use `refund_offer` template\n3. Customer requests policy exception → Escalate to manager\n\n**Q&A Capture:**\n- Is template selection clear?\n- Do operators understand when to escalate vs. reply?\n- Any confusion about SLA breach indicators?\n\n---\n\n### 4. Sales & Inventory Workflows (20 minutes)\n**Objective:** Understand sales tracking and inventory alerts\n\n**Sales Pulse Tile:**\n- Shows order count, revenue for current window\n- Top SKUs list with units sold\n- Open fulfillment count (future: drill-in modal)\n- QA readiness evidence: Playwright staging run `artifacts/playwright/shopify/playwright-staging-2025-10-10T04-20-37Z.log` covers modal open/close and decision logging paths.\n\n**Inventory Heatmap Tile:**\n- Low stock alerts with SKU, units left, days of cover\n- Color coding: red (<7 days), yellow (7-14 days), green (>14 days) — future enhancement\n- Actions (future): Create draft PO, adjust quantity, mark intentional\n\n**Practice:**\n- Operators review mock inventory alerts\n- Identify which SKUs need reorder vs. intentional low stock\n\n**Q&A Capture:**\n- Is \"days of cover\" calculation clear?\n- What additional inventory data would be helpful?\n- Any confusion about fulfillment blockers?\n\n---\n\n### 5. Decision Logging & Audit Trail (10 minutes)\n**Objective:** Understand how actions are tracked\n\n**Concepts:**\n- Every approval action creates decision_log entry\n- Decision includes: shopDomain, action type, operatorEmail, timestamp, payload\n- Decisions sync to Supabase for analytics (scope: `ops`)\n\n**Viewing Decisions:**\n- Future: Audit trail view in dashboard\n- Current: Decisions viewable in database (support/admin only)\n\n**Privacy & Compliance:**\n- Operator email logged for accountability\n- Customer data (names, emails) stored per Shopify/Chatwoot policies\n- Decision logs retained for 90 days (configurable)\n\n**Q&A Capture:**\n- Any privacy concerns about decision logging?\n- What audit reports would be useful?\n\n---\n\n### 6.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":3286,"endCharIdx":7420,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Yb7cdYbUvfIIALn8aNin43MdIDnAv+8YcgqUgf4QYA4="},"d54a29f7-364d-4f91-9195-a540b481c44e":{"id_":"d54a29f7-364d-4f91-9195-a540b481c44e","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"viXJuVzrrVJ/Lft8cw/p6IcSrAiIfwhYoFMBGf1vj4U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b68dc14e-8102-423b-a34b-00fd22d8dfe1","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"IBIfAgc/rVI/a1U94strC4Hgq5BlMoF7rUzd8EW0nrQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a906bf45-f6ef-4553-ba17-043c80005c87","metadata":{},"hash":"GwHn2sThoQ5YXTjQt3kgFQcYgrpyOLhBTR8qXijol0M="}},"text":"- What additional inventory data would be helpful?\n- Any confusion about fulfillment blockers?\n\n---\n\n### 5.

Error Handling & Integration Monitoring (10 minutes)\n**Objective:** Recognize errors and know escalation paths\n\n**Error States:**\n- Tile shows \"Error\" status → Integration failure (Shopify API down, Chatwoot unreachable)\n- \"Configuration required\" status → Missing credentials or setup incomplete\n- Empty state: \"No SLA breaches detected\" (normal, not an error)\n- Shopify banner \"API rate limit exceeded.\" → Reference `docs/enablement/job_aids/shopify_sync_rate_limit_coaching.md` and the support playbook `docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md`\n\n**Escalation Paths:**\n- Integration errors → Alert reliability team (#incidents) (internal channel)\n- Shopify rate-limit persists after two retries → Capture headers and escalate to reliability via # `#occ-reliability` using the playbook\n- Data discrepancies → File Linear ticket with screenshots + timestamps\n- Persistent failures → Escalate to support lead\n\n**Practice:**\n- Show mock error state in tile\n- Role-play the Shopify rate-limit coaching script (first-hit reassurance + escalation) and document notes in the Q&A template\n- Operators practice filing ticket with evidence (screenshot + description)\n\n**Q&A Capture:**\n- Is error messaging clear?\n- Do operators know who to contact for each issue type?\n\n---\n\n### 7. Hands-On Practice Session (15 minutes)\n**Objective:** Operators complete realistic scenarios independently\n\n**Scenarios:**\n1. **CX Escalation:** Customer \"Alex Rivera\" conversation SLA breached, use `ack_delay` template\n2. **Inventory Alert:** SKU \"HOODIE-BLK-M\" at 15 units, 5 days of cover → identify as reorder needed\n3. **Manager Escalation:** Customer \"Jordan Lee\" requests refund >$500 → escalate to manager\n4. **Error Handling:** Chatwoot tile shows error → file ticket with screenshot\n\n**Evidence Reference:** QA staging validation log `artifacts/playwright/shopify/playwright-staging-2025-10-10T04-20-37Z.log` demonstrates CX Escalations modal approve/escalate/resolve flows on Fly staging.\n\n**Trainer Observation:**\n- Note any confusion, hesitation, or incorrect actions\n- Capture in Q&A template for follow-up\n\n---\n\n### 8. Q&A & Feedback Collection (5 minutes)\n**Objective:** Gather operator feedback for product/engineering\n\n**Questions:**\n- What dashboard features are most valuable?\n- What's confusing or needs improvement?\n- What additional data or actions would help daily workflows?\n\n**Feedback Capture:**\n- Use docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md\n- Support agent files Linear tickets for each improvement opportunity\n- Evidence: screenshots, exact quotes, timestamps\n\n---\n\n## Q&A Capture Template\n\nSee: docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md\n\n---\n\n## Training Materials Checklist\n- [ ] Dashboard access with mock mode enabled (`?mock=1`)\n- [ ] Copy of this agenda (printed or digital)\n- [ ] Q&A capture template\n- [ ] Screenshot/screen recording tools\n- [ ] Linear project access for ticket filing\n- [ ] #incidents (internal channel) channel access\n\n---\n\n## Dry Run Coordination — 2025-10-08\n- **Primary proposal:** Wednesday, 2025-10-16 @ 13:00 ET (aligns with marketing's launch prep window)\n- **Owner:** Riley Chen (Product) — confirmation requested in `feedback/product.md`\n- **Support prep:** Send agenda + Q&A template by 2025-10-14, verify `FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS=1` in staging, confirm Chatwoot seed data covers shipping + refund scenarios.\n- **Dependencies:** Latest English copy deck alignment (`docs/design/copy_deck.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":6581,"endCharIdx":10865,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"c0TNgWq2n13loQbsnLDLGf08RDgRMWPnyjy7uQHGG7E="},"a906bf45-f6ef-4553-ba17-043c80005c87":{"id_":"a906bf45-f6ef-4553-ba17-043c80005c87","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"viXJuVzrrVJ/Lft8cw/p6IcSrAiIfwhYoFMBGf1vj4U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d54a29f7-364d-4f91-9195-a540b481c44e","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"CCaf9kfqoA3E583c0uxrvrSjFKf35D161hgJny9EV3Q="}},"text":"mock=1`)\n- [ ] Copy of this agenda (printed or digital)\n- [ ] Q&A capture template\n- [ ] Screenshot/screen recording tools\n- [ ] Linear project access for ticket filing\n- [ ] #incidents (internal channel) channel access\n\n---\n\n## Dry Run Coordination — 2025-10-08\n- **Primary proposal:** Wednesday, 2025-10-16 @ 13:00 ET (aligns with marketing's launch prep window)\n- **Owner:** Riley Chen (Product) — confirmation requested in `feedback/product.md`\n- **Support prep:** Send agenda + Q&A template by 2025-10-14, verify `FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS=1` in staging, confirm Chatwoot seed data covers shipping + refund scenarios.\n- **Dependencies:** Latest English copy deck alignment (`docs/design/copy_deck.md`), Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids staged in `docs/enablement/job_aids/`, staging shop access package from product (OCC-214).\n- **Comms Sync:** Coordinate enablement/marketing resend once QA posts green evidence;

Start the services:\n   ```bash\n   supabase start\n   ```\n2. Export your environment:\n   ```bash\n   export $(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs)\n   ```\n3. Apply migrations and generate the Prisma client:\n   ```bash\n   npm run setup\n   ```\n   Evidence: attach the command output to your feedback entry.\n\n## Staging / Production\n1. Mirror credentials from vault to GitHub (`DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`).\n2. From a privileged terminal (with the staging `.env` sourced), run:\n   ```bash\n   npm run setup\n   ```\n   - `prisma generate` uses `DATABASE_URL` automatically.\n   - `prisma migrate deploy` applies `prisma/migrations/*` to the target database.\n3. Record the output and any schema changes in `feedback/deployment.md` and `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`.\n\n## Rollback / Forward Validation\nUse Prisma’s CLI directly:\n```bash\nprisma migrate status\nprisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration-id>\nprisma migrate deploy\n```\n- Always pass `--schema prisma/schema.prisma` if executing from outside the repo root.\n- Never use SQLite helpers; the Postgres datasource is canonical.\n\n## Resetting a Sandbox Database\n```bash\nprisma migrate reset --force --skip-seed --schema prisma/schema.prisma\n```\nOnly run inside disposable environments (local dev or QA sandboxes). Capture before/after table counts and log them in `feedback/qa.md`.\n\n## Supabase Specific Tasks\n- Run `supabase/sql/observability_logs.sql` to provision the logging table when creating new projects.\n- Tail live activity with `scripts/ops/tail-supabase-logs.sh <project-ref>` during deploys.\n- Deploy edge functions (e.g., `occ-log`) alongside DB changes using the Supabase CLI commands documented in `docs/runbooks/supabase_local.md`.\n\n## Evidence Checklist\n- `npm run setup` output (local + staging)\n- Supabase log snippet (`scripts/ops/tail-supabase-logs.sh`)\n- Prisma `migrate status` or `migrate resolve` output when rolling back\n- Updated env matrix (`docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`)","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":2466,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sKv32UAx7cCnBqWO/bcfCMUxYnZIFkkgYLqJXKR5Dns="},"3d8e171f-88d0-4bee-a0fc-dc4f2f1999aa":{"id_":"3d8e171f-88d0-4bee-a0fc-dc4f2f1999aa","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/qa_playwright_plan.md","lastModified":"2025-10-09T01:10:45.017Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/qa_playwright_plan.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/qa_playwright_plan.md","lastModified":"2025-10-09T01:10:45.017Z"},"hash":"pGXv/vhchKZwPKN9GPpVpuWHq97LC8NY8JCsWIyFKQc="}},"text":"# Playwright Coverage Plan — CX Escalations & Sales Pulse (Draft 2025-10-09)\n\n## Scope\n- CX Escalations modal flows: open → approve → escalate → resolve.\n- Sales Pulse modal (pending implementation) focus on chart + action buttons.\n\n## Test Matrix\n| Scenario | Data Setup | Assertions |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n| Approve templated reply | Seed conversation with `ship_update` suggestion | Button enabled, decision log request emitted, toast confirms send |\n| Escalate to manager | SLA breach + missing template | Escalation tag applied, audit log action `chatwoot.escalate` present |\n| Missing suggestion fallback | Conversation without heuristics keywords | Approve disabled, guidance text visible |\n| Sales Pulse anomaly | Mock data toggles anomaly flag | Modal copy matches English-only deck, telemetry event fired |\n\n## Fixtures Needed\n- Staging Chatwoot conversation seeds (shipping + refund).\n- Decision log Supabase access for assertion step.\n- Mock Sales Pulse dataset with anomaly toggle.\n\n## Next Steps\n1.

This checklist aligns with direction governance (`docs/directions/product.md`) and the deployment protocol (`docs/git_protocol.md`).\n\n## Preconditions\n- You have an assigned restart window and communication plan approved in `feedback/manager.md`.\n- Local workspace is on the correct branch (`agent/<role>/<task>` or `main`) with latest changes pulled.\n- Required credentials (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, Shopify Admin API demo shop, etc.) are present locally and in CI.\n- Alerting partners (reliability, enablement, support) acknowledged the restart window in # `#occ-launch`.\n\n## Checklist\n| Step | Action | Evidence / Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Run `git status -sb` and capture screenshot or text snippet for the restart record. | Attach output to `feedback/<role>.md` if any unexpected changes appear. |\n| 2 | Execute `git stash push --include-untracked --message \"restart-cycle-YYYY-MM-DD\"` to snapshot local work. | Record resulting stash ID (e.g., `stash@{0}`) in `feedback/product.md` under **Restart Cycle** section. |\n| 3 | Verify `git stash list` includes the new entry; confirm no other uncommitted work remains. | If stash fails (clean tree), explicitly note the clean state in the feedback log. |\n| 4 | Capture current monitoring artifacts prior to restart: `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`, synthetic check logs, and any feature flag overrides. | Link artifacts in the feedback log so telemetry deltas can be compared post-restart. |\n| 5 | Coordinate go/no-go with reliability and deployment; confirm Supabase decision sync and staging secrets remain intact after restart. | Update `feedback/product.md` and ping reliability if anomalies surface. |\n| 6 | Execute restart script/runbook steps (see `docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md` or environment-specific guide). | Note the exact command(s) and timestamps in the feedback log. |\n| 7 | Post-restart validation: run smoke tests (`npm run test:smoke` or agreed subset), confirm dashboards render, and check Supabase telemetry ingestion. | Log results and any regressions, including links to updated artifacts. |\n| 8 | If blockers remain, create follow-up task in Linear (OCC-###) with evidence links; tag owning teams. | Reference backlog updates in `feedback/product.md` to maintain audit trail. |\n| 9 | Once validation passes, notify stakeholders in `#occ-launch` and close the restart cycle entry in the feedback log with final status. | Include stash pop instructions if remaining work must resume (`git stash pop stash@{n}`). |\n\n## Reminders\n- Do **not** delete stashes created for restart cycles until all teams confirm work completed or rescheduled.\n- Update this runbook only via manager-approved change requests (direction governance).\n- Archive restart evidence bundles older than 30 days under `artifacts/archive/restart-cycles/`.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":3253,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MuMTSohsFutIenSb6XI5U3EZ80YRZg6FWbZ3D7d2wv4="},"cd51f88b-2dd6-4800-ab18-f9a43d2b5fe4":{"id_":"cd51f88b-2dd6-4800-ab18-f9a43d2b5fe4","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"jgRHqcNpXjPC2y/LXAmD8ajan2JXpgyQB6DLyekcD9I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"586d5298-aa92-4fa2-9901-6082eb50190d","metadata":{},"hash":"yB5ciXGCnQzeiHdF9PdHNwsrwVQsJHZbRiqlJ6XrdUc="}},"text":"---\nepoch: 2025.10.E1\ndoc: docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md\nowner: support\nlast_reviewed: 2025-10-10\ndoc_hash: TBD\nexpires: 2025-10-17\n---\n# Shopify Dry Run Checklist — Support Lead\n\n## Purpose\nEnsure support delivers a disciplined rehearsal of the HotDash Shopify Admin app on 2025-10-16.

brief enablement + marketing via customer.support@hotrodan.com that invites/comms stay in draft.\n- 🛠 **Prep Work:** Maintain mock-mode rehearsals only, keep evidence folders staged, and line up notification copy so we can relaunch within 2h of QA’s green signal.\n- 🗂 **Operator Q&A:** Collect questions/answers asynchronously (#, email) and log them in `docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md` so facilitators have fresh context once the hold lifts.\n- 📝 **Logging:** Capture all updates/blockers in `feedback/support.md`; mirror dependencies in partner feedback logs so stakeholders know the hold rationale.\n- 📡 **Chatwoot Fly cut-over:** Track reliability’s Fly migration updates (`docs/deployment/chatwoot_fly_runbook.md`), stage cut-over comms drafts, and keep `scripts/ops/chatwoot-fly-smoke.sh` refreshed with the announced host/token so the smoke can run the moment reliability signals go-live.\n\n## Timeline Tasks\n\n### T-72 Hours (2025-10-13)\n| # | Task | Owner | Evidence / Artifact | Status |\n|---|------|-------|---------------------|--------|\n| 1 | Re-confirm sprint focus + dry run objectives with product/enablement (`docs/directions/support.md`) | Support | Note in `feedback/support.md` | Pending — schedule sync by 2025-10-13 |\n| 2 | Verify restart cycle outcomes with integrations (`docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`) to ensure Shopify readiness tracker is current | Support ↔ Integrations | Updated row in `docs/integrations/integration_readiness_dashboard.md` | Pending — awaiting integrations owner |\n| 3 | Collect open questions from support trainers/operators and seed `docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md` | Support | Q&A template updated with draft prompts | Pending — gather trainer inputs 2025-10-12 |\n| 4 | Confirm attendee list + facilitator assignments with product (`docs/strategy/operator_dry_run_pre_read_draft.md`) | Product ↔ Support | Acknowledgment in `feedback/product.md` + `feedback/support.md` | Pending — product confirmation required |\n\n### T-48 Hours (2025-10-14)\n| # | Task | Owner | Evidence / Artifact | Status |\n|---|------|-------|---------------------|--------|\n| 1 | Validate staging access package: Shopify Admin demo shops, Chatwoot sandbox token, Supabase decision log key, Shopify CLI auth token | Product / Deployment | Credentials logged in `feedback/support.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4008,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Al7p8BHEfTNa38A3e2GpJHe62jh57d3Xeqn6YblIfnM="},"586d5298-aa92-4fa2-9901-6082eb50190d":{"id_":"586d5298-aa92-4fa2-9901-6082eb50190d","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"jgRHqcNpXjPC2y/LXAmD8ajan2JXpgyQB6DLyekcD9I="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cd51f88b-2dd6-4800-ab18-f9a43d2b5fe4","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"Ed3DEjjbNn/dkpxZt1A/qxSZRqQgy5OgqqbV+/ll2Zk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c0cc374a-d64e-4bd0-87b2-b0ecfa27b6e3","metadata":{},"hash":"59of0FfBOEcl5gXY9LSTh/7jiYx6mb576QsHmn2CRoM="}},"text":"md` | Pending — awaiting integrations owner |\n| 3 | Collect open questions from support trainers/operators and seed `docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md` | Support | Q&A template updated with draft prompts | Pending — gather trainer inputs 2025-10-12 |\n| 4 | Confirm attendee list + facilitator assignments with product (`docs/strategy/operator_dry_run_pre_read_draft.md`) | Product ↔ Support | Acknowledgment in `feedback/product.md` + `feedback/support.md` | Pending — product confirmation required |\n\n### T-48 Hours (2025-10-14)\n| # | Task | Owner | Evidence / Artifact | Status |\n|---|------|-------|---------------------|--------|\n| 1 | Validate staging access package: Shopify Admin demo shops, Chatwoot sandbox token, Supabase decision log key, Shopify CLI auth token | Product / Deployment | Credentials logged in `feedback/support.md` + vault entry screenshots | Pending — blocked on staging bundle |\n| 2 | Confirm feature flags + mock params for rehearsal (`FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS`, `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS`, `?mock=1`) | Engineering ↔ Support | Screenshot or flag checklist stored in `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/` | Pending — to verify once staging access delivered |\n| 3 | Review job aids + AI samples for accuracy (`docs/enablement/job_aids/*`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/*`) | Support ↔ Enablement | Sign-off note in `feedback/enablement.md` | Pending — awaiting design overlays |\n| 4 | Sync with integrations on Shopify deploy readiness (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`) and capture any credential gaps | Support ↔ Integrations | Updated checklist status + note in `feedback/support.md` | Pending — monitoring `DEPLOY-147` |\n| 5 | Rehearse Shopify validation queue via `https://hotdash-stag{{ABBREV_0}}fly.dev/app` using mock + live smoke paths;

confirm the embedded app loads inside the staging store Admin.\n- Fly staging host is warm: `https://hotdash-stag{{ABBREV_0}}fly.dev/app`.\n\n## Host Parameter\nShopify embedded apps require the `host` query parameter (base64-encoded admin path):\n\n- Plaintext: `admin.shopify.com/store/hotrodddash/apps/4f72376ea61be956c860dd020552124d`\n- Encoded (no padding, already URL-safe):\n\n```\nYWRtaW4uc2hvcGlmeS5jb20vc3RvcmUvaG90ZGFzaC1zdGFnaW5nL2FwcHMvNGY3MjM3NmVhNjFiZTk1NmM4NjBkZDAyMDU1MjEyNGQ=\n```\n\nReference this value in any manual launches:\n\n```\nHOST_PARAM=YWRtaW4uc2hvcGlmeS5jb20vc3RvcmUvaG90cm9kZGFzaC9hcHBzLzRmNzIzNzZlYTYxYmU5NTZjODYwZGQwMjA1NTIxMjRk\nhttps://hotdash-stag{{ABBREV_1}}fly.dev/app?embedded=1&mock=1&host=${HOST_PARAM}\n```\n\n## Capturing a Session (Embed) Token\n1. Authenticate with Shopify CLI if needed:\n   ```bash\n   shopify login --store hotroddash.myshopify.com\n   ```\n2. Run or tunnel the app so it is accessible inside Admin (for local development):\n   ```bash\n   shopify app dev --store hotroddash.myshopify.com\n   ```\n   Keep this command running; it updates the app URLs and opens the embedded app in Admin automatically.\n3. In the Shopify Admin tab that opens (or visit `https://admin.shopify.com/store/hotrodddash/apps/hotdash`), wait for the embedded app to load.\n4. In the left navigation, open **Session token tool** (`/app/tools/session-token`).\n5. Click **Refresh now** if a token isn’t already displayed, then use **Copy token**. The tool auto-refreshes tokens before they expire and surfaces decoded claims so you can confirm the token is valid.\n6. Store the token temporarily in a secure editor (never commit to Git). Tokens expire quickly—capture screenshots or run tests within 60 seconds.\n\n## Using the Token Outside Admin\nYou can render the embedded app (for screenshots or automated runs) by including both the `host` parameter and the bearer token:\n\n```\ncurl --silent \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${SESSION_TOKEN}\" \\\n  \"https://hotdash-stag{{ABBREV_2}}fly.dev/app?embedded=1&mock=1&host=${HOST_PARAM}\"\n```\n\n- Swap `mock=1` with `mock=0` for live data once staging returns 200.\n- For browser sessions (e.g., Playwright), inject the token as a `Authorization: Bearer` header or use Playwright’s `extraHTTPHeaders`.\n\n## Playwright Pipeline Injection Plan\n- **Storage:** Reliability will escrow the latest token in `vault/occ/shopify/embed_token_staging.env` and mirror to GitHub secret `SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN_STAGING` (staging environment). Deployment owns refresh + distribution once reliability posts the updated token.\n- **Environment wiring:** CI and local Playwright runs should export `PLAYWRIGHT_SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN=${SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN_STAGING}` alongside `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://hotdash-stag{{ABBREV_4}}fly.dev/app`.

Pair this playbook with the enablement coaching snippets (`docs/enablement/job_aids/shopify_sync_rate_limit_coaching.md`) so operators receive calm, consistent guidance while we capture evidence and escalate appropriately.\n\n## Trigger\n- Dashboard surfaces the `API rate limit exceeded.` banner or tiles show stale `Last updated` timestamps during an operator interaction.\n- Support receives a report that metrics are not refreshing and retries have already begun.\n\n## Escalation Contacts\n| Purpose | Contact | Notes |\n|---------|---------|-------|\n| Reliability handoff | # `#occ-reliability` | Include request ID, throttle JSON, first banner timestamp |\n| Operator comms alignment | Support lead on duty | Confirm operator messaging + incident tracking |\n\n## Immediate Response (First Banner)\n1. **Acknowledge:** Reassure the operator using the coaching script. Remind them that retries occur automatically (15s, 30s, 60s backoff).\n2. **Verify Shopify status:** Check `https://status.shopify.com` for active incidents.\n3. **Capture headers:** Open the OCC debug drawer (`Cmd/Ctrl` + `.`) and note:\n   - `X-Request-ID`\n   - GraphQL cost header (`X-GraphQL-Cost.requestedCost`, `.actualCost`, `.throttleStatus.currentlyAvailable`, `.throttleStatus.maximumAvailable`)\n4. **Record context:** Document tile(s) affected and the current `Last updated` timestamp.\n5. **Wait for automatic retry:** Allow up to 60 seconds. If the banner clears and timestamps advance, log the recovery and close the loop.\n\n## Escalation Path (Banner Persists After 2 Retries)\n1. Inform the operator using the escalation snippet and advise against manual refresh spam.\n2. Log an entry in `feedback/support.md` (timestamp, tiles, request ID, throttle values).\n3. Ping `#occ-reliability` with:\n   - Request ID and throttle JSON\n   - When the banner first appeared\n   - Whether retries advanced the `Last updated` timestamp\n4. Capture a screenshot of the banner + timestamp for evidence (store in `artifacts/support/incidents/<date>/`).\n5. Track follow-up in the operator Q&A template if the incident happened during a live session (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md`).\n\n## Reliability / Product Coordination\n- Reliability may rerun `npm run ops:retry-shopify-sync -- --scope all` after reviewing throttling.\n- Product/support should note duration of stale data and update decision logs or operator comms accordingly.\n- AI agent to log recommendation impact in `feedback/ai.md` if CX suggestions were skipped due to stale data.\n\n## Evidence Checklist\n- [ ] Shopify status page screenshot or confirmation (if incident present)\n- [ ] Debug drawer capture with request/throttle headers\n- [ ] Dashboard banner screenshot with timestamp\n- [ ] `feedback/support.md` entry + # permalink to `#occ-reliability`\n- [ ] Post-recovery note (time banner cleared, actions taken)\n\n## Reference Materials\n- Operator coaching snippets: `docs/enablement/job_aids/shopify_sync_rate_limit_coaching.md`\n- Operator training agenda staging steps: `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`\n- Dry run prep checklist: `docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md`\n- Integration readiness: `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`\n- Restart cycle checklist: `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`\n\n## Change Log\n| Date | Author | Change |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 2025-10-10 | support | Initial playbook drafted to align with rate-limit coaching direction |\n| 2025-10-10 | support | Added Shopify staging install checklist for dry run prep |\n## Shopify Staging Install Checklist\n- [ ] Shopify Admin demo store credentials received (DEPLOY-147) with vault path + GitHub secret timestamp noted\n- [ ] Confirm OCC app install in staging store (Shopify Admin → Apps → HotDash) with `?","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4060,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fctG+KcJcWnXiCswjCg9knWqaZrlV3KJYPPTm2+A9Uk="},"7f61fe51-a9ca-4e9f-b792-2f4e11942903":{"id_":"7f61fe51-a9ca-4e9f-b792-2f4e11942903","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"LnWhGNjM+AUQT0mxs6MZ798874QWSXoqTBXS3mj7FTI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a2f82284-be96-4160-ab0b-fc2c7f761e1e","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"w3Ne9Di0pOS2KUZjXawlI1maca/a1XeTuLOq8lgl4B8="}},"text":"md`\n- Dry run prep checklist: `docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md`\n- Integration readiness: `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`\n- Restart cycle checklist: `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`\n\n## Change Log\n| Date | Author | Change |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 2025-10-10 | support | Initial playbook drafted to align with rate-limit coaching direction |\n| 2025-10-10 | support | Added Shopify staging install checklist for dry run prep |\n## Shopify Staging Install Checklist\n- [ ] Shopify Admin demo store credentials received (DEPLOY-147) with vault path + GitHub secret timestamp noted\n- [ ] Confirm OCC app install in staging store (Shopify Admin → Apps → HotDash) with `?mock=1` param validated\n- [ ] Verify feature flags (`FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS`, `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS`) enabled per dry run scenario plan\n- [ ] Supabase decision log access confirmed (service key/test query run)\n- [ ] Evidence stored in artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/logs/","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":3363,"endCharIdx":4336,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6OvEA03w0Iaaui7luE7dt8FMFbasIQs7Tw05XfudT3Q="},"ec4090e6-2e2d-4693-bfa8-569cd52399cd":{"id_":"ec4090e6-2e2d-4693-bfa8-569cd52399cd","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/supabase_local.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.387Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/supabase_local.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/supabase_local.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.387Z"},"hash":"fYsgV+UxbT/hYAffGscF8RfNOyOmQiD5daRnzA694A0="}},"text":"---\nrunbook: Supabase Local Development\nowner: reliability\nlast_exercised: TBD\nnext_window: TBD\n---\n\n# Supabase Local Development Runbook\n\n## Overview\nWe run Supabase locally (Postgres, REST, Auth, Storage) via the Supabase CLI. This runbook covers bringing the stack up, exporting environment variables, tailing logs, and deploying the `occ-log` edge function used for observability.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Supabase CLI (`npm install -g supabase`)\n- Docker running locally\n- Repository cloned and `.env.local` created from `.env.local.example`\n\n## Startup\n```bash\nsupabase start\n```\nOutputs include connection strings and the path to the generated service keys. Services listen on:\n- Postgres: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres`\n- REST API: `http://127.0.0.1:54321`\n- Studio: `http://127.0.0.1:54323`\n\n## Environment\n1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and populate Shopify + OpenAI placeholders.\n2. Export the file before running commands:\n   ```bash\n   export $(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs)\n   ```\n3. Verify Prisma can connect:\n   ```bash\n   npm run setup\n   ```\n\n## Logs\nUse the helper script to stream local events:\n```bash\nscripts/ops/tail-supabase-logs.sh\n```\nPass a remote project ref to target a hosted project:\n```bash\nscripts/ops/tail-supabase-logs.sh abcd1234\n```\n\n## Observability Edge Function\nThe `occ-log` edge function centralises structured logs.\n\n1. Create the backing table:\n   ```bash\n   psql \"$DATABASE_URL\" -f supabase/sql/observability_logs.sql\n   ```\n2. Serve locally:\n   ```bash\n   supabase functions serve occ-log --env-file .env.local\n   ```\n3. Deploy remotely:\n   ```bash\n   supabase functions deploy occ-log --project-ref <project-ref>\n   supabase secrets set --project-ref <project-ref> SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role-key>\n   ```\n4. Smoke test:\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST \"https://<project>.functions.supabase.co/occ-log\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"level\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"local smoke\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"runbook\"}}'\n   ```\n\n## Shutdown\n```bash\nsupabase stop\n```\nThis halts the containers but keeps your data volumes. Use `supabase db reset` only for clean-room scenarios.\n\n## Evidence\n- Capture CLI output, screenshots (Studio, logs), and curl responses in `feedback/reliability.md` or `feedback/data.md` depending on the task.\n- Reference this runbook ID when noting playback in stand-ups or direction updates.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":2418,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vPzLKV/SWO27X4JXX4j++I8JWfWyY4V0woZGjqqG+M8="},"f6b2b991-f03d-47c4-a14d-695d0aa13358":{"id_":"f6b2b991-f03d-47c4-a14d-695d0aa13358","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/supabase_staging_secret_handoff.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/supabase_staging_secret_handoff.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/supabase_staging_secret_handoff.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.331Z"},"hash":"UXYbOlkD9pZlxYMPwDoLXKfumJsvLx/9DtVwo9pOM7o="}},"text":"---\nepoch: 2025.10.E1\ndoc: docs/runbooks/supabase_staging_secret_handoff.md\nowner: ai\nlast_reviewed: 2025-10-10\ndoc_hash: TBD\nexpires: 2025-10-17\n---\n# Supabase Staging Secret Handoff Checklist\n\n## Purpose\n- Document the exact credentials reliability must provide so AI decision logging can move off the in-memory fallback ahead of the Shopify staging push.\n- Give deployment a single reference for loading GitHub environment secrets and engineers a template for populating local `.env` files without guesswork.\n\n## Required Secrets\n| Variable | Environment | Owner | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `SUPABASE_URL` | Local development / CI | Reliability → AI | Staging project URL (e.g., `https://<project>.supabase.co`) with Row Level Security enabled. |\n| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Local development / CI | Reliability → AI | Service role key scoped to `decision_log` and `facts` tables.

Remove legacy French/localization references when encountered.\n- **Exact terminology:** Use the precise wording from the copy deck (e.g., \"Approve & Send Reply\", \"Decision logged to audit trail\"). Avoid ad-hoc synonyms.\n- **Tone consistency:** Mirror the action-oriented, empathetic tone captured in the brand tone deck and Chatwoot templates.\n- **Change traceability:** Capture deviations or copy requests in `feedback/enablement.md` with links to the impacted material.\n\n---\n\n## Audit Checklist (Runbooks & Trainings)\nRun this checklist whenever operator enablement content is updated:\n1. `docs/runbooks/*` — Remove bilingual strings, glossary tables, or translation queues. Replace with English terminology pulled from the copy deck.\n2. `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md` — Confirm references to dependencies mention English-only job aids and copy sources.\n3. `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md` and other tile guides — Verify button labels, toast text, and modal headings match the copy deck exactly.\n4. `docs/marketing/*` references — If pointing to retired localization requests, swap with current English artifacts or remove.\n5. Job aids and quick-start guides — Ensure image callouts and captions use approved English text.\n\nDocument any edits or questions in `feedback/enablement.md` so marketing/support can trace the audit.\n\n---\n\n## Chatwoot Template Alignment (English)\n1. Review each template in `app/services/chatwoot/templates.ts` against the copy deck language.\n2. Confirm tone matches the brand tone deck (professional, empathetic, action-oriented).\n3. Highlight mismatches in `feedback/enablement.md` with the template key and proposed revision.\n4. Once marketing approves, coordinate with engineering to ship updated macros and notify support trainers.\n\n**Callouts:**\n- `ack_delay`, `ship_update`, and `refund_offer` already align with the current tone. Use them as exemplars for new templates.\n- If operators suggest alternative phrasing, capture rationale and route through marketing before updating source material.\n\n---\n\n## Support ⇄ Marketing Coordination\n**Cadence:**\n- **Weekly (Wed):** 15-minute huddle to review copy deck diffs and upcoming launches.\n- **Ad-hoc:** Spin up when product ships new modals, tiles, or toasts that require enablement collateral.\n\n**Agenda Template:**\n1. Review copy deck changes since last sync.\n2. Surface enablement doc updates and confirm terminology.\n3. Share operator feedback gathered from trainings or pilots.\n4. Align on messaging for upcoming Sales Pulse/CX Escalations walkthroughs.\n5. Decide owners and due dates for copy revisions.\n\n**Evidence:** Log outcomes in Memory (`scope: ops`, `decision_type: support.copy_alignment`) and attach edited docs/job aids.\n\n---\n\n## Copy Change Workflow\n1. Draft proposed English copy update (context + desired change).\n2. File note in `feedback/enablement.md` with link to the source doc and copy snippet.\n3. Tag marketing owner for approval; include screenshots if UI text is involved.\n4. Once approved, update the relevant runbook/job aid and notify support trainers.\n5. Record the change in the artifact revision history (table at bottom of doc or commit message).","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4286,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UUzOpbbHPyPdIJr1Uhd28Nn70+YTaawKkoQXjmc7Dew="},"952990aa-1982-422c-b025-dfe08111314c":{"id_":"952990aa-1982-422c-b025-dfe08111314c","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/support_marketing_localization_sync.md","lastModified":"2025-10-09T01:10:45.017Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/runbooks/support_marketing_localization_sync.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/support_marketing_localization_sync.md","lastModified":"2025-10-09T01:10:45.017Z"},"hash":"v/0RU1fXoEe0t5uYJEXV1GuWlooIHXpYCWlSsPnDl5E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"39a2a57b-e7c3-4b34-bbeb-4beff7d79134","metadata":{"source":"docs/runbooks/support_marketing_localization_sync.md","lastModified":"2025-10-09T01:10:45.017Z"},"hash":"6RLUPrNivGDGoD3nYF+xKJdb5nsv3QuxVQ++wmocqMk="}},"text":"Review copy deck changes since last sync.\n2.

Pair each reference with the corresponding modal section when narrating during the 2025-10-16 rehearsal.\n\n## CX Escalations Modal Callouts\n1. **Header Summary** — Customer name + conversation ID and status. Highlight the SLA breach badge (per tooltip spec in `docs/design/tooltip_annotations_2025-10-09.md`) and remind facilitators to verbalise the breach timestamp.\n2. **Conversation History** — Scrollable log with Agent/Customer labels and timestamps. Emphasise that screen readers experience this as a live region (`role=\"log\"`).\n3. **Suggested Reply Field** — Editable textarea seeded with AI copy when `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS=1`. Call out the abstain state (copy absent) so operators know to escalate or draft manually.\n4. **Internal Note Field** — Capture promise details, owner handoffs, and evidence references. Screenshot should show placeholder \"Add context for audit trail\" and note that this content syncs to Supabase.\n5. **Action Buttons Row** — Guardrail summary: `Approve & send` (primary), `Escalate`, `Mark resolved`, and `Cancel`. Highlight disabled state when reply textbox is empty.\n\n## Sales Pulse Modal Callouts\n1. **Header Summary** — Revenue + order count text line. Mention referencing `docs/data/kpis.md` for ±15% / ±30% thresholds during narration.\n2. **Top SKU Table** — Highlight revenue + units columns; flag SKUs that also appear in the Inventory Heatmap for restock decisions.\n3. **Open Fulfillment Issues** — Call out the Shopify `displayStatus` column and remind operators to capture owner + next action in the Q&A template.\n4. **Capture Follow-up Section** — Screenshot the Action dropdown (`Log follow-up`, `Escalate to ops`) and notes textarea. Reinforce that selections sync to Supabase decision logs.\n5. **Primary Action Button** — Emphasise that the label mirrors the selected action (e.g., `Log follow-up`) and triggers the Supabase write; capture disabled state while regression tests run.\n\n## Inventory Heatmap Modal Callouts\n1. **SKU Summary Block** — Entry focus lands here; describe what the focus ring looks like (`--occ-focus-ring`). Alt text should spell out SKU, stock, threshold, and days of cover.\n2. **Days of Cover Chip** — Reference `docs/design/assets/modal-inventory-heatmap-annotations.svg` (`top-end` tooltip) that clarifies the projection string. Narrate the expected tooltip copy while the screenshot callout displays.\n3. **Velocity Analysis Card** — Highlight average velocity, peak day, and trend wording. Emphasize that screen readers hear this content sequentially; alt text mirrors the bullet format.\n4. **Recommended Reorder Panel** — Stress supplier + quantity recommendation and link to SOP for draft PO. Capture in screenshot with annotation badge “3”.\n5. **Action Row** — Confirm operators see `Confirm`, `Mark Intentional`, `Snooze`. Note that the primary `Confirm` button must retain focus until toast acknowledgement; remind presenters to mention the ensuing toast state.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Swap these text callouts for designer-provided annotated screenshots once exports arrive (tracked in `feedback/designer.md`).\n- When capturing screenshots, follow naming convention `modal-<cx|sales>_callout-<n>.png` and upload to `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/`.\n- Add `modal-inventory_callout-<n>.png` variants once staging screenshot overlays are available; alt text should copy bullet 1–5 above verbatim as descriptive captions.\n- Interim asset: baseline dashboard overview stored at `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/scenarios/2025-10-10T0421Z_dashboard-overview.png` (mock data).

The CX Escalations modal surfaces SLA context, recent messages, and AI-suggested replies so operators can respond, escalate, or close conversations without leaving HotDash.\n\n> Screenshot callouts pending designer assets. Coordinate with design (docs/directions/designer.md) before distributing outside the enablement team.\n\n---\n\n## Pre-Flight Checklist\n- Chatwoot integration connected and `FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS` enabled in staging/prod.\n- Operators authenticated in Chatwoot (single sign-on or API token) to avoid send failures.\n- Confirm SLA threshold in `CHATWOOT_SLA_MINUTES` matches training scenario (default 60 minutes).\n- Verify reply templates (`app/services/chatwoot/templates.ts`) are up to date with marketing-approved copy.\n- Credentials check complete: Supabase + Chatwoot keys validated 2025-10-10 15:45 UTC; log any regression immediately via `customer.support@hotrodan.com` and # `#occ-reliability`.\n- Chatwoot Fly migration pending — review the validation steps in `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md` so you can brief operators on the new host once reliability confirms cut-over.\n\n## Chatwoot on Supabase — Architecture Talking Points\n- **Runtime:** Chatwoot web + Sidekiq workers now live on Fly.io. Redis (Upstash) backs job queues, but all durable data routes to Supabase so audit and retention policies stay centralized.\n- **Persistence:** Conversation history, templates, and decision logs share Supabase tables. Remind operators that every modal action writes to Supabase first, then emits to Chatwoot; evidence trails therefore live under the Supabase NDJSON exports referenced in training packets.\n- **Access & Credentials:** The Shopify embed token unlocks the Chatwoot Fly host inside the dashboard. Any credential drift (Shopify, Chatwoot API, Supabase service key) surfaces as modal errors—log via `customer.support@hotrodan.com` with artifact paths.\n- **Guardrails:** Retention and restart cycles follow Supabase compliance runbooks (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`). Reinforce during training that operators must escalate if they spot gaps so compliance can refresh evidence.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Steps\n1. **Open conversation** — From the CX Escalations tile, click an item to launch the modal. Review the header for customer name, status, and SLA breach timestamp.\n2. **Scan context** — Read the last 3–5 messages in the Conversation Preview. Confirm the customer's latest request and tone.\n3. **Evaluate the suggested reply** — Compare the AI suggestion with the scenario. Check for correct customer name, promise, and next steps. Edit inline if adjustments are needed.\n4. **Choose an action**:\n   - `Approve & send` when the suggestion is accurate and resolves the request.\n   - `Escalate` for policy exceptions, high-dollar refunds, or dissatisfied tone after breach.\n   - `Mark resolved` only after the customer confirms resolution or a follow-up plan is in place.\n   - `Cancel` to keep the conversation open while you gather more context.\n5. **Confirm decision logging** — Wait for the success toast (`Reply sent to {customer}` or `Decision logged to audit trail`).

Use the Sales Pulse modal to compare today's performance against the 7-day baseline, review top-performing SKUs, and triage fulfillment blockers before they impact customers.\n\n> Screenshot callouts pending final design assets. Coordinate with designer per docs/directions/designer.md before distributing printed copies.\n\n---\n\n## Pre-Flight Checklist\n- Shopify integration connected and data refresh < 15 minutes old (check tile meta text).\n- Operator signed into Shopify Admin with appropriate permissions.\n- Inventory Heatmap tile reviewed for overlapping SKU risks.\n- Decision log access confirmed for follow-up (audit trail retained for 90 days).\n- Credentials check complete: staging Shopify + Supabase keys validated 2025-10-10 15:45 UTC; report any errors to `customer.support@hotrodan.com` and # `#occ-reliability`.\n- Note upcoming Chatwoot Fly migration: partner with support to surface updated CX escalation workflows in this modal if the cut-over happens before the dry run.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Steps\n1. **Open the modal** — Click `View details` on the Sales Pulse tile from the Operator Control Center dashboard.\n2. **Review the revenue snapshot** — Note today's revenue versus the rolling 7-day average. Use the KPI thresholds from `docs/data/kpis.md` (warning at ±15%, critical at ±30%).\n3. **Scan order volume** — Confirm the order count matches expectations for the time of day. Flag unexpected dips or spikes in `#occ-ops` internal channel.\n4. **Inspect Top SKUs** — Identify SKUs driving revenue. Cross-check availability in the Inventory Heatmap; queue replenishment discussions if a top SKU appears in low-stock alerts.\n5. **Triage fulfillment blockers** — Scroll to the \"Open fulfillment\" list. For each pending order, verify status in Shopify and log owner + next action in the training Q&A template.\n6. **Capture decisions** — Use the action select to choose `Log follow-up` or `Escalate to ops`, add notes for the audit trail, and submit. Log the decision in Memory (`scope: ops`, `decision_type: sales.health_check`) and forward supporting context to `customer.support@hotrodan.com` when variance exceeds 15% or fulfillment blockers persist.\n\n---\n\n## Decision Guardrails\n- **Revenue delta > 15% drop** — Create an action item for operations; escalate to product if drop exceeds 30% or persists >2 checkpoints. Email `customer.support@hotrodan.com` with the summary so support has audit coverage.\n- **Sustained order spike (>25% over baseline)** — Notify fulfillment lead to adjust staffing, confirm carriers can absorb the volume.\n- **Pending fulfillment older than 24h** — Page fulfillment lead for immediate follow-up; if order value >$500, notify operations manager.\n- **Top SKU out of stock or <3 days of cover** — Partner with inventory owner to trigger reorder workflow or mark as intentional scarcity.\n\n### AI Guardrails & Evidence — 2025-10-10\n- Modal insights load from the same operator knowledge index refreshed at 2025-10-10T19:26:46Z (`packages/memory/indexes/operator_knowledge/index_metadata.json`);

When the Operator Control Center pulls fresh metrics (orders, inventory, fulfillment) too quickly, Shopify responds with `API rate limit exceeded.` The dashboard surfaces this as a banner or stale timestamp. Operators need a calm, repeatable script to confirm status, wait for the retry window, and log the event for auditing.\n\n## Operator Script (First Hit)\n> **\"Looks like Shopify is rate-limiting our dashboard refresh. Give me about a minute — the system will automatically retry once the window resets. If the timestamp is still stale after that, I'll capture the request ID and loop in reliability.\"**\n\n- Coach operators to read the banner verbatim (`API rate limit exceeded.`) so the support team can match the copy in tickets.\n- Remind them that the dashboard retries with exponential backoff (15s, 30s, 60s) — no manual refresh spam.\n- Prompt operators to note the `Last updated` timestamp on the tile for later logging.\n\n## Verification Checklist\n1. Confirm Shopify status page (`https://status.shopify.com`) shows no ongoing incidents.\n2. Open the Operator Control Center debug drawer (`Cmd/Ctrl` + `.`) and capture:\n   - `X-Request-ID` header\n   - GraphQL cost header (`X-GraphQL-Cost` → `requestedCost`, `actualCost`, `throttleStatus.currentlyAvailable`, `throttleStatus.maximumAvailable`)\n3. Record the time the banner appeared and the tile(s) affected (`Sales Pulse`, `Inventory Heatmap`, etc.).\n4. Wait for the automatic retry (up to 60 seconds). If the banner clears and `Last updated` advances, close the loop.\n\n## Escalation Script (Persistent After 2 Retries)\n> **\"The rate limit is still active after the retry window. I'm escalating to reliability with the request ID and throttle headers so they can check for stuck jobs. You'll continue to see the last successful data until they confirm recovery.\"**\n\n- File a note in `feedback/support.md` (include time, tile, request ID).\n- Ping `#occ-reliability` with the request ID, throttle values, and whether the retry cleared the banner.\n- Ask operators to avoid manual bulk operations (e.g., `Re-run sync`) until reliability confirms the queue is healthy.\n\n## Recovery Actions for Reliability/Product\n- Reliability replays the stalled job via `npm run ops:retry-shopify-sync -- --scope all` once OK'd.\n- Product/support update decision logs or operator comms with the impact window (tiles stale minutes, affected scenarios).\n- AI agent logs the incident in `feedback/ai.md` if recommendations were skipped due to stale data.\n\n## Evidence to Capture\n- Reference support playbook steps if escalation needed (`docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md`).\n- Screenshot of the dashboard banner + tile timestamp.\n- Debug drawer snippet with `X-Request-ID` and throttle status JSON.\n- Timestamped note in `feedback/support.md` and link to the internal channel thread.\n- Once resolved, add the recovery confirmation (time banner cleared, retry ID or command used).\n\n## Training Tips\n- Role-play both the first-hit reassurance and the escalation handoff so operators internalize the calm tone.\n- Pair the snippet with a quick refresher on Shopify's cost-based throttling (1,000 points per minute; most OCC queries cost 10-50).\n- Encourage operators to keep a pre-filled template for rate-limit incidents; support will house the final copy in the shared incident template directory once published.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":3669,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4WguoZReKRSKHLEQ4FYkcZVe/KyqR45ua02GbFLrLSo="},"c159ec3d-67b1-4e63-a5c8-ddf2830a3dcb":{"id_":"c159ec3d-67b1-4e63-a5c8-ddf2830a3dcb","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:19:10.105Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:19:10.105Z"},"hash":"95g7C/zQWutsl/XIct0/BHX4SSm1WAOxkLlHc7LPXxY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4078aee8-eec9-441b-a5f0-5ef7c9bd520f","metadata":{},"hash":"C82FdK2c9KMlVra4m1oPov6496dZZtSHvvZyKsHp/F4="}},"text":"---\nepoch: 2025.10.E1\ndoc: docs/marketing/launch_faq.md\nowner: marketing\nlast_reviewed: 2025-10-07\ndoc_hash: TBD\nexpires: 2025-10-18\n---\n# Operator Control Center — Launch FAQ (Support Ready)\n\n## How to Use This FAQ\n- Audience: Store operators, CX leads, support agents preparing for launch.\n- Tone: Professional, approachable, action-oriented (per `docs/marketing/brand_tone_deck.md`).\n- Localization: EN complete; FR translation pending professional review (flagged P1).\n- Evidence links provided so support can cite source material when responding.\n\n---\n\n## Access & Activation\n\n### Q: How do I access the Operator Control Center?\nA: Once the app is updated, log into Shopify Admin → Apps → HotDash. The dashboard opens to the Operator Control Center home with all five tiles visible.\n\n**Evidence:** App navigation spec (`app/routes/app._index.tsx`).\n\n### Q: Do I need to enable anything before first use?\nA: No extra setup is required to see Sales Pulse, Inventory Heatmap, Fulfillment Health, or SEO & Content Watch in mock mode. Connect integrations (Chatwoot, Google Analytics) to unlock live data.\n\n**Evidence:** Product operating plan (`docs/directions/product_operating_plan.md`).\n\n### Q: Can team members without Shopify Admin access use the dashboard?\nA: Operator Control Center inherits Shopify Admin permissions. Anyone who can access the HotDash app can use the dashboard; there is no separate login.\n\n**Evidence:** App authentication runbook (`docs/runbooks/authentication.md`).\n\n---\n\n## Integrations & Data Sources\n\n### Q: What integrations are required for full coverage?\nA: Shopify is always-on. Connect Chatwoot for CX Escalations and Google Analytics for SEO & Content Watch. Inventory data comes directly from Shopify; Sales Pulse uses Shopify Orders + Payments APIs.\n\n**Evidence:** Launch comms packet — \"Supporting Materials\" section (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`).\n\n### Q: How do I connect Chatwoot?\nA: Go to Operator Control Center → Settings → Integrations → Chatwoot. Paste the API token generated in Chatwoot (Admin → Settings → API Access). Status indicator turns green when connected.\n\n**Evidence:** Integration walkthrough script (`docs/strategy/initial_delivery_plan.md`, M3 section).\n\n### Q: What if Google Analytics isn’t connected?\nA: SEO & Content Watch tile will show \"Connect Google Analytics\" with a CTA to authorize via OAuth. The rest of the dashboard still functions.\n\n**Evidence:** Product design wireframes (`docs/design/wireframes/dashboard_wireframes.md`).\n\n---\n\n## AI & Automation\n\n### Q: What does \"AI-suggested reply\" mean?\nA: For CX Escalations, the system reads conversation history from Chatwoot and drafts a suggested reply. Operators always review, edit, and approve before anything sends. No auto-send.\n\n**Evidence:** Brand tone deck — AI messaging section (`docs/marketing/brand_tone_deck.md`).\n\n### Q: What data is shared with the AI provider?\nA: We send only the most recent messages needed for context and automatically strip payment details, emails, and phone numbers before the prompt goes to OpenAI (via our LlamaIndex service). Drafts and approvals are retained for audit purposes for up to 12 months.\n\n**Evidence:** DPIA (`docs/compliance/dpia_chatwoot_openai.md`).\n\n### Q: Is the suggested reply logged anywhere?\nA: Yes. When you approve or edit an AI reply, the final message and decision are captured in the decision audit trail.\n\n**Evidence:** Decision logging schema (`packages/facts/README.md`).\n\n### Q: Can I disable AI suggestions?\nA: Yes. Toggle \"AI Reply Suggestions\" off in Settings → CX. The tile will still surface escalations, but without draft replies.\n\n**Evidence:** Settings spec (`docs/design/wireframes/settings_cx.md`).\n\n---\n\n## Configuration & Thresholds\n\n### Q: Can we adjust SLA breach times?\nA: Yes. Choose 2h, 4h, or 8h in Settings → CX → SLA Breach Threshold. The tile recalculates in under a minute.\n\n**Evidence:** Product operating plan (Release Review Checklist, Mock) (`docs/directions/product_operating_plan.md`).\n\n### Q: How are low-stock alerts calculated?\nA: Inventory Heatmap flags SKUs when projected days-of-cover falls below your set threshold (default 7 days).","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4175,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NF1CvfsDx9P10d8RlEkmyD3n0VhRWZeNAqH1QFL+Mek="},"4078aee8-eec9-441b-a5f0-5ef7c9bd520f":{"id_":"4078aee8-eec9-441b-a5f0-5ef7c9bd520f","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:19:10.105Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:19:10.105Z"},"hash":"95g7C/zQWutsl/XIct0/BHX4SSm1WAOxkLlHc7LPXxY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c159ec3d-67b1-4e63-a5c8-ddf2830a3dcb","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:19:10.105Z"},"hash":"qtEvkGxqHY5caubsl/bG40W2g1oFMO+6w9dmwCu3Lak="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"33b53b59-8b97-4404-a548-c6bb9a930d01","metadata":{},"hash":"44P5J8lLyf/SMSS8WmLPaP25Ag7jS5soSo0AkUVISSk="}},"text":"**Evidence:** Decision logging schema (`packages/facts/README.md`).\n\n### Q: Can I disable AI suggestions?\nA: Yes.

Recommendations consider 14-day sales velocity.\n\n**Evidence:** Inventory data contract (`packages/facts/inventory_heatmap.md`).\n\n### Q: Can I set custom SEO drop percentages?\nA: Yes. SEO & Content Watch supports 15%, 20%, or 25% week-over-week drop thresholds. Adjust in Settings → SEO.\n\n**Evidence:** Launch comms packet tooltip copy (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`).\n\n---\n\n## Data & Security\n\n### Q: Where is my data stored?\nA: Data stays within your Shopify store and connected tools. HotDash caches data in Supabase per Shopify security standards; no customer PII leaves the ecosystem.\n\n**Evidence:** Security runbook (`docs/runbooks/security.md`).\n\n### Q: What operator analytics do you collect?\nA: We log limited telemetry (operator email, tile interactions, request IDs) so we can monitor uptime and improve the dashboard. Records live in Supabase for up to 180 days and are restricted to the HotDash reliability team.\n\n**Evidence:** Privacy notice update draft (`docs/compliance/privacy_notice_updates.md`).\n\n### Q: Can I opt out of analytics tracking?\nA: Yes. Toggle \"Share usage analytics\" off in Settings → Privacy. You can also email customer.support@hotrodan.com to request manual removal. Opting out doesn’t affect dashboard access.\n\n**Evidence:** Privacy notice update draft (`docs/compliance/privacy_notice_updates.md`).\n\n### Q: Who can view the decision audit trail?\nA: Anyone with HotDash dashboard access can view the audit trail. Permissions mirror Shopify Admin roles.\n\n**Evidence:** Audit trail spec (`docs/strategy/initial_delivery_plan.md`, Decision Logging section).\n\n### Q: Does the app support GDPR/CCPA compliance?\nA: Yes. Data retention follows Shopify app policies, and all actions are auditable. Contact support if a deletion request is made; the runbook covers steps.\n\n**Evidence:** Compliance checklist (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`, Compliance section).\n\n---\n\n## Telemetry & Success Metrics\n\n### Q: What metrics prove adoption?\nA: Key metrics include Operator activation rate (>70%), in-app banner CTR (>15%), session opens, and tile interaction counts. Operators can view a summary in the Ops Pulse tile (release candidate v1.M2).\n\n**Evidence:** Launch comms packet — Metrics & Success Tracking (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`).\n\n### Q: How do we report bugs or feedback?\nA: Use the \"Have feedback?\" link in the dashboard (routes to customer.support@hotrodan.com) or log an issue in GitHub (`https://github.com/Jgorzitza/HotDash/issues`). For beta partners, #occ-feedback internal channel is monitored.\n\n**Evidence:** Release notes template (Support section) (`docs/marketing/release_notes_template.md`).\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Q: Why do tiles show \"Mock data\" labels?\nA: Mock mode is active when integrations aren’t connected or Shopify sync hasn’t completed. Flip the mock/live toggle in Settings → General once data connections succeed.\n\n**Evidence:** Product operating plan (Mock Review requirements) (`docs/directions/product_operating_plan.md`).\n\n### Q: Inventory numbers look off — what should I check?\nA: Confirm Shopify inventory sync completed (Settings → Inventory → Last Sync timestamp). Re-run sync manually if older than 15 minutes.\n\n**Evidence:** Inventory runbook (`docs/runbooks/inventory_sync.md`).\n\n### Q: I don’t see the decision audit trail link.\nA: Ensure you’ve updated to v1.M2.0 or later.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":3410,"endCharIdx":7560,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UOci56xebye4n2K+Ws0H6TgoKPXjIsnTA8vBqZFoy6E="},"33b53b59-8b97-4404-a548-c6bb9a930d01":{"id_":"33b53b59-8b97-4404-a548-c6bb9a930d01","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:19:10.105Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:19:10.105Z"},"hash":"95g7C/zQWutsl/XIct0/BHX4SSm1WAOxkLlHc7LPXxY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4078aee8-eec9-441b-a5f0-5ef7c9bd520f","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_faq.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:19:10.105Z"},"hash":"C82FdK2c9KMlVra4m1oPov6496dZZtSHvvZyKsHp/F4="}},"text":"**Evidence:** Release notes template (Support section) (`docs/marketing/release_notes_template.md`).\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Q: Why do tiles show \"Mock data\" labels?\nA: Mock mode is active when integrations aren’t connected or Shopify sync hasn’t completed.

Clear browser cache if the nav link still doesn’t appear; the route is `/app/audit-trail`.\n\n**Evidence:** Release notes template (v1.M2.0 example) (`docs/marketing/release_notes_template.md`).\n\n---\n\n## Training & Support\n\n### Q: Is there a training session scheduled?\nA: Support training is targeted for the week of 2025-10-14. Date to be confirmed once product approves final deck.\n\n**Evidence:** Feedback log (`feedback/marketing.md`, 2025-10-06 entry).\n\n### Q: Where can I find the brand tone guide?\nA: See `docs/marketing/brand_tone_deck.md` for voice, message pillars, and boilerplate copy in EN/FR.\n\n### Q: Will translations be available at launch?\nA: Yes. French copy is drafted and awaiting professional review. Expect signed-off translations before production go-live.\n\n**Evidence:** Designer request in `docs/design/copy_deck_modals.md` (Translation Review Required).\n\n---\n\n## Revision Log\n| Date | Change | Owner |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 2025-10-07 | Initial FAQ drafted for operator-facing launch support. | Marketing |\n\n## Pending Items\n- [ ] Add FR translations post review.\n- [ ] Insert staging URL + mock credentials once finalized by product.\n- [ ] Update training date after support schedules session.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":6744,"endCharIdx":8785,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ImXIN9ttTD4cWBvUQpv3COXi0GHhgvjarlvgQI958Oo="},"03734a46-b324-4fda-943f-a1fb80965e07":{"id_":"03734a46-b324-4fda-943f-a1fb80965e07","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.323Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.323Z"},"hash":"uk2MFn2XaVkNC2QF2xiFZE4r9j7pXShClm8xRI5NBPk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ecbd051a-8fb3-45e5-98d2-959be6e90099","metadata":{},"hash":"oE57mlfa6lfvRzAhfm7KySvYg8A0ezBdpdjsnbTiqy4="}},"text":"---\nepoch: 2025.10.E1\ndoc: docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md\nowner: marketing\nlast_reviewed: 2025-10-10\ndoc_hash: TBD\nexpires: 2025-10-18\n---\n# Launch Communications Packet — Operator Control Center\n\n## Approval & Evidence Tracker\n| Surface | Owner | Status (2025-10-10) | Evidence / Placeholder |\n|---------|-------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| In-app banner | Marketing | Copy updated with OpenAI/LlamaIndex + Inbox messaging — **hold pending QA evidence** | `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md#banner` |\n| Launch email | Marketing | Copy updated with OpenAI/LlamaIndex + Inbox messaging — **hold pending QA evidence** | `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md#email` |\n| Blog post | Marketing | Draft updated with OpenAI/LlamaIndex + Inbox messaging — **hold pending QA evidence** | `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md#blog-post` |\n| Tooltip overlays & modal visuals | Design | ⚠️ Admin embed overlays pending Shopify token; React Router spec refreshed 2025-10-10 | Spec: `docs/design/tooltip_modal_annotations_2025-10-09.md`, handoff: `artifacts/engineering/modal-react-router-handoff_2025-10-10.md`, offline mocks: `artifacts/design/offline-cx-sales-package-2025-10-11/`, placeholder → upload Admin overlays to `artifacts/design/tooltip-overlays/2025-10-10/` once token lands |\n| Telemetry & readiness evidence | Marketing + Reliability | ✅ Supabase parity + staging smoke (`?mock=1`) captured; Shopify staging secrets validated | `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json`, `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`, `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T02-31-11.417Z.json`, `feedback/reliability.md` (2025-10-10 01:14 UTC) |\n| Staging smoke (`?mock=0`) | Reliability | ⏳ Pending QA sign-off; capture immediately once HTTP 200 sustained | Placeholder → `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-<timestamp>-mock0.json` + `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/curl_mock0_<timestamp>.log` |\n| Staging access rollout comms | Marketing + Support | Ready pending live smoke; announcement + acknowledgement tracker staged | `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md#draft-announcement-copy-hold-until-mock0-200`, `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md#acknowledgement-log-template` |\n| Supabase NDJSON export | Reliability + Data | ✅ Delivered 2025-10-10 07:29 UTC; bundle ready for comms packet | `artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson` |\n| Staging readiness broadcast (internal ops) | Support ↔ Marketing | Templates staged — awaiting `DEPLOY-147` evidence drop | §2B, `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/` (placeholder files noted) |\n| Security incident response | Deployment + Reliability | ✅ Clearance received 2025-10-10 16:00 UTC — existing secrets validated; external messaging stays *on hold* until QA + embed token greenlights | `feedback/manager.md` (2025-10-10 16:00Z), `feedback/reliability.md` (2025-10-10 15:55Z), `feedback/marketing.md` (security status log) |\n\n**Security incident status:** Git history scrub completed (`af1d9f1` pushed 2025-10-10 08:12 UTC).

Today, we're launching the **Operator Control Center**, a single dashboard that surfaces the daily truth across your most critical workflows.\n\nFrom SLA-breaching customer conversations to low-stock SKUs, every tile gives you context, recommended actions, and one-tap approvals. The new Operator Inbox keeps approvals and escalations in one place, while our LlamaIndex middleware feeds OpenAI-powered copy that stays audit-ready.\n\n## Why We Built This\n\nWe talked to 20+ store operators over the past month. The same pain points came up again and again:\n\n- **Tab fatigue:** Switching between Shopify Admin, Chatwoot, Google Analytics, and spreadsheets\n- **Delayed escalations:** CX conversations breaching SLA before anyone notices\n- **Stockout surprises:** Bestsellers going out of stock without warning\n- **Traffic blindspots:** SEO declines discovered days (or weeks) too late\n- **Fragmented approvals:** AI drafts, escalations, and follow-ups scattered across email, docs, and chat threads\n\nThe Operator Control Center solves these by consolidating your daily truth into one embedded dashboard.\n\n## What's Inside\n\n### CX Escalations\nSurface open conversations breaching SLA thresholds. View full context, approve AI-suggested replies (OpenAI powered via our LlamaIndex middleware), or escalate to a manager—all in one tap.\n\n**Operator benefit:** Stop tab-switching. Resolve escalations in seconds, not minutes. Every approval syncs to the Operator Inbox for follow-up.\n\n### Operator Inbox\nKeep approvals, escalations, and AI drafts in one shared queue. Assign owners, add notes, and move work forward without leaving Shopify Admin.\n\n**Operator benefit:** Nothing slips through email cracks. Everyone sees the same queue, linked back to tile telemetry. Chatwoot now runs on Fly, so inbox updates reach operators with lower latency and better failover.\n\n### Sales Pulse\nTrack today's order count vs. 7-day average, top SKUs, and fulfillment blockers—all at a glance.\n\n**Operator benefit:** Know your sales health in 3 seconds. Spot anomalies without running reports.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":15177,"endCharIdx":19565,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"RkOHmfYnS9OOujUFhnNpoiGRuuoh3MdP5mezC5HC86g="},"07420b70-d70e-4962-abfe-4cb7a3db610c":{"id_":"07420b70-d70e-4962-abfe-4cb7a3db610c","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.323Z"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.323Z"},"hash":"uk2MFn2XaVkNC2QF2xiFZE4r9j7pXShClm8xRI5NBPk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"41e3a1ab-b636-4003-a30a-1f746370e3c5","metadata":{"source":"docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md","lastModified":"2025-10-11T00:18:41.323Z"},"hash":"KByf6KjXuasayfzIn4ngdBkABSLx1AZ9goMzKF8peWA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c45745cf-e369-495f-bf53-af2dbba968af","metadata":{},"hash":"pCs5Yvv15Fe5JPZ1galw1G2+47RHyEGPFyvftDMJo50="}},"text":"View full context, approve AI-suggested replies (OpenAI powered via our LlamaIndex middleware), or escalate to a manager—all in one tap.\n\n**Operator benefit:** Stop tab-switching.

Spot anomalies without running reports.\n\n### Inventory Heatmap\nIdentify low-stock SKUs, days of cover, and AI-recommended reorder quantities based on 14-day velocity with insights assembled through LlamaIndex.\n\n**Operator benefit:** Prevent stockouts with proactive alerts. Create draft purchase orders with one approval tap.\n\n### SEO & Content Watch\nDetect landing pages with >20% session drop week-over-week. Assign content refresh tasks to your team.\n\n**Operator benefit:** Catch traffic declines before they hurt conversions. Track follow-up tasks straight from the Operator Inbox.\n\n## Privacy & Security\n\nOperator Control Center lives inside Shopify Admin, so your existing permissions decide who can view or take action on tiles. We log limited operator telemetry (email, tile interactions, request IDs) in Supabase for up to 180 days to power the decision audit trail and reliability monitoring. AI copy runs through our LlamaIndex middleware before reaching OpenAI, and we automatically remove payment details and other PII. You can disable analytics at any time in Settings → Privacy, and our [Privacy Notice] details how data is handled across integrations.\n\nNeed a hand during rollout? Email `customer.support@hotrodan.com`. Our Chatwoot Fly deployment routes requests straight into the Operator Inbox so specialists can respond with the same telemetry you see in OCC.\n\n## How It Works\n\nEvery tile follows the same pattern:\n\n1. **Surface the truth** — Real-time data from Shopify, Chatwoot, Google Analytics\n2. **Recommend action** — AI-powered suggestions based on context\n3. **Approve workflow** — One-tap approvals with decision audit trail\n\nNo vanity metrics. Every tile owns a workflow that ends in a decision or logged follow-up.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Activation Steps\n\n1. Open your Shopify Admin\n2. Navigate to Apps → [Your App Name]\n3. Click \"Operator Control Center\" in the nav\n4. Configure integrations (Shopify is pre-connected; add Chatwoot + Google Analytics for full coverage)\n\n### Integration Setup\n\n- **Shopify:** Pre-configured (uses your existing admin credentials)\n- **Chatwoot:** Add API token in Settings → Integrations\n- **Google Analytics:** Connect via OAuth (read-only access)\n\nAll credentials are stored securely per Shopify's app standards.\n\n### GA MCP Phase-2 Messaging (Hold)\n\n- Do not publish GA MCP availability until OCC-INF-221 delivers host + credentials and parity checklist items 1-8 pass.\n- Reference `docs/marketing/phase2_ga_mcp_messaging.md` for positioning pillars, evidence requirements, and asset updates.\n- Prep internal notes so once credentials land we can add landing-page insights copy to the launch email/blog without rework.\n\n## What's Next\n\nThis is v1. We're already working on:\n\n- **Social Sentiment (Phase 2):** Track campaign health across X/Meta\n- **GA MCP Integration (Phase 2):** Bring landing page + acquisition telemetry into OCC once credentials + parity checks clear (`docs/marketing/phase2_ga_mcp_messaging.md`)\n- **Advanced Automations:** Auto-approve low-risk actions based on your rules\n- **Custom Tiles:** Build your own tiles with our SDK\n\nHave feedback?
