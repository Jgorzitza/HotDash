      "question": "How to implement Fix API 410 Errors - Update Deprecated Endpoints? What are the steps and requirements?",
      "answer": "To implement Fix API 410 Errors by updating deprecated endpoints, follow these steps and requirements:\n1. **Identify Deprecated Endpoints**: Review the API documentation to identify which endpoints are deprecated and causing 410 errors.\n2. **Update API Calls**: Replace deprecated endpoints in your codebase with the recommended alternatives. Ensure that all instances of the old endpoints are updated.\n3. **Testing**: After updating the endpoints, run tests to ensure that the new endpoints function correctly and that there are no regressions in the application. Use the command `npm run test` to execute your test suite.\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement improved error handling for the new endpoints. This includes providing clear error messages and possibly adding \"How to Fix\" links to runbooks for future reference [Source 1].\n5. **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made to the API endpoints. Ensure that the new endpoints are documented clearly for future developers.\n6. **Deployment**: Once testing is complete and documentation is updated, deploy the changes to the production environment.\n7. **Monitoring**: After deployment, monitor the application for any new errors or issues related to the updated endpoints.\n**Requirements**:\n- Ensure that all changes comply with the existing coding standards and practices.\n- Maintain backward compatibility if necessary, to avoid breaking changes for users still using the old endpoints.\n- Follow the guidelines for logging and evidence requirements as specified in the development documentation [Source 6].\nIf there are specific tools or libraries required for the implementation, refer to the project documentation for any additional dependencies or setup instructions.",

      "question": "What are the best practices for integrations agent when working on Fix API 410 Errors - Update Deprecated Endpoints?",
      "answer": "The best practices for integrations agents when working on Fix API 410 Errors and updating deprecated endpoints include the following:\n1. **Use MCP Tools First**: Always pull the relevant MCP (Managed Code Protocol) documentation before writing any code. This ensures that you are using the most current and accurate information for API integrations, particularly for Shopify and other critical services [Source 9].\n2. **Validate GraphQL Code**: For any GraphQL mutations or queries, use the `validate_graphql_codeblocks` tool to ensure that the code adheres to the expected structure and standards. This is mandatory for all GraphQL interactions [Source 6].\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling by checking for `userErrors` in all GraphQL responses. This will help identify issues early and provide actionable feedback [Source 6].\n4. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits, especially when making multiple requests to services like Shopify. Implement a delay (e.g., 500ms between calls) to avoid hitting these limits [Source 6].\n5. **Log Progress and Feedback**: Update the feedback file every two hours with progress and any blockers encountered. This helps maintain transparency and allows for timely assistance if issues arise [Source 6].\n6. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure that all new integrations are accompanied by comprehensive tests, including unit tests and contract tests, to validate functionality and prevent regressions [Source 7].\n7. **Coordinate with Other Teams**: Maintain clear communication with other teams (e.g., Inventory and Analytics) to ensure that dependencies are managed effectively and that all phases of integration are completed in a timely manner [Source 5].\n8. **Document Changes**: Keep documentation up to date with any changes made during the integration process. This includes updating core docs and maintaining a clear record of the integration tasks completed [Source 2].\nBy following these best practices, integrations agents can effectively manage API updates and minimize the occurrence of errors related to deprecated endpoints.",

      "question": "API implementation patterns and best practices",
      "answer": "API implementation patterns and best practices for the HotDash development team include the following key elements:\n1. **Approvals Loop**: Every action must go through a defined approvals loop with states such as Draft, Pending Review, Approved, Applied, Audited, and Learned. Each suggestion or reply must include evidence, projected impact, risks, and rollback strategies. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) mandates reviews within 15 minutes for customer experience (CX) and same-day for inventory and growth [Source 1].\n2. **Use of Tools**: Actions should only be applied through server-side tools (e.g., Shopify Admin GraphQL, Supabase RPC, Chatwoot API) to ensure consistency and prevent manual edits outside the established flow. This includes using the Approvals Drawer for validating tool calls and enforcing human-in-the-loop (HITL) processes for customer and social interactions [Source 3].\n3. **Evidence and Audit Trails**: Every action must include evidence (such as logs and metrics) and be auditable. This includes persisting receipts and rollback artifacts to ensure transparency and accountability in the process [Source 2][Source 3].\n4. **Integration with MCP**: The use of the MCP (Managed Control Plane) is mandatory for all API interactions, especially for Shopify GraphQL mutations. This ensures that all actions are validated against the latest specifications and best practices [Source 10].\n5. **Error Handling and Rate Limiting**: Implement robust error handling for API responses, especially for GraphQL queries, and enforce rate limiting (e.g., 500ms between Shopify API calls) to prevent overwhelming the services [Source 7][Source 9].\n6. **Structured Logging and Observability**: Utilize structured logs and observability tools (like Prometheus) to monitor the health of the system and track the performance of API calls [Source 2].\n7. **Accessibility and User Experience**: Ensure that all user interfaces are designed with accessibility in mind, following guidelines such as WCAG AA standards. This includes proper labeling, focus management, and responsive design [Source 5][Source 8].\n8. **Continuous Learning**: Incorporate feedback loops where human edits and grades are recorded to improve the system continuously. This learning phase is crucial for refining processes and enhancing the overall user experience [Source 1][Source 3].\nBy adhering to these patterns and best practices, the HotDash team can ensure a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly API implementation.",
