      "question": "What are the best practices for designer agent when working on Action Queue Dashboard UI?",
      "answer": "The best practices for designer agents when working on the Action Queue Dashboard UI include the following:\n1. **Visual Consistency**: Ensure that all visual elements match the design specifications exactly. This includes verifying that all states (default, hover, loading, error, success) are present and accessible [Source 5].\n2. **Accessibility Compliance**: Conduct thorough accessibility checks to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA standards. This includes testing keyboard-only navigation and ensuring focus traps are in place for modals [Source 6].\n3. **User Experience (UX) Validation**: Validate that the user experience is smooth and intuitive. This involves testing features like drag & drop functionality, theme switching, and ensuring that user preferences persist in the database [Source 4].\n4. **Real-Time Data Display**: Ensure that all dashboard tiles display real-time data and that they load within the specified time limits (e.g., all tiles should load in less than 3 seconds) [Source 1].\n5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement and validate feedback mechanisms such as toast notifications, browser notifications, and alerts to keep users informed about actions and statuses [Source 1].\n6. **Testing and Iteration**: Engage in iterative testing to refine the dashboard features based on user feedback and performance metrics. This includes validating the functionality of all tiles and ensuring they meet the acceptance criteria [Source 4].\n7. **Documentation and Collaboration**: Maintain clear documentation of design specifications and collaborate closely with engineers to ensure that the implementation aligns with the design vision [Source 3].\nBy following these best practices, designer agents can contribute to a more effective and user-friendly Action Queue Dashboard UI.",
