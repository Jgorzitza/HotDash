# Staging Deployment Pipeline Review — 2025-10-09

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` syntax check | ✅ | Steps align with verify → deploy sequence; smoke + Lighthouse artifacts persisted to `artifacts/ci/`.
| `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` flag review | ✅ | Confirms `FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS=1` exported before Shopify CLI deploy.
| Smoke target availability | ⚠️ Blocked | Awaiting staging URL from product to populate `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` secret.
| Post-deploy notification | ⏳ | Slack webhook placeholder present; needs reliability to insert real endpoint.
| Evidence capture | ✅ | Workflow configured to upload Playwright & Lighthouse results; validated artifact paths locally.

## Next Steps
- Follow up with product for staging URL to unblock smoke target secret.
- Coordinate with reliability to supply Slack webhook and confirm permissions.
- After secrets land, schedule dry-run execution prior to 2025-10-16 operator session.
