## Accessibility guidance
- **Alt text**: Use "Screenshot of [modal name] highlighting [callout description]" for each image. Avoid referencing color alone; include tooltip copy verbatim.
- **Contrast**: When placing callout numbers, use Polaris text critical (#d82c0d) on white backgrounds with a 2px outline for legibility.
- **Focus demo**: During live training, tab through modals to show `.occ-focus-visible` outline. Mention skip links and Escape key closure explicitly.
- **Translations**: Keep copy English-only in visuals; provide localized captions via separate transcript if needed.
- **Support inbox**: Reinforce that escalations and variance alerts route through `customer.support@hotrodan.com`; trainers should call out the inbox in narration and demo the logging workflow.
