# Hootsuite Rollback Plan

Reference: `docs/integrations/social_sentiment_vendor_recommendation.md` â€” contingency section.

Actions when Hootsuite API unavailable:
1. Switch dashboard tile to mock sentiment data feed.
2. Notify Marketing + Reliability via #sentiment-integrations channel.
3. Evaluate pivot to native X + Meta APIs using pre-documented requirements.

Finalize once vendor access is confirmed and fallback automation steps are scripted.
