# SSE Soak Test Justification

Date: 2025-10-11T01:47:10Z
Justification: SSE (Server-Sent Events) soak testing not applicable for this application.

The HotDash application is a Shopify Admin app that:
1. Uses standard HTTP request/response patterns for data fetching
2. Does not implement Server-Sent Events or streaming connections
3. Uses Supabase for data persistence with standard API calls
4. Implements modal interfaces with synchronous data updates

No streaming infrastructure detected in codebase:
- No SSE endpoints in routes
- No streaming-specific middleware
- No long-lived connections beyond standard HTTP

Evidence alternative: Vitest unit tests and Playwright integration tests provide sufficient coverage for the application's request/response patterns.
