# Shopify Dry Run Evidence Bundle

This folder stores artifacts for the 2025-10-16 Shopify rehearsal per `docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md`.

- `scenarios/` — Tile and modal screenshots, decision log excerpts
- `metrics/` — Outputs from `npm run ops:nightly-metrics` and related telemetry snapshots
- `logs/` — Zoom chat exports, Q&A template copies, facilitator notes
- `recordings/` — Meeting recording files or links (placeholder if hosted externally)

Add files with ISO timestamps in the filename (e.g., `2025-10-16T1300Z_sales-pulse.png`). Mirror highlights in Memory and `feedback` logs when uploading.
