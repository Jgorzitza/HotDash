# Prisma Migration Validation Report

## Executive Summary
✅ **SQLite Migration Validation: PASSED**
- Forward migrations: PASS (3/3 migrations applied)
- Rollback to zero: PASS (clean reset)
- Schema validation: PASS (schema integrity confirmed)
- Table structure: PASS (all 4 expected tables present)

⏳ **Postgres Migration Validation: PENDING**
- Blocked on staging Postgres connectivity (per feedback/qa.md)
- Ready to execute once DATABASE_URL resolves

## Test Execution

### SQLite Forward/Back Validation
**Command**: `bash scripts/qa/test-migration-rollback.sh`
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-10 14:40:25 UTC
**Evidence**: `artifacts/migrations/20251012T083100Z_sqlite/forward-back.log`

### Migrations Tested
1. `20240530213853_create_session_table` ✅
2. `20251005160022_add_dashboard_facts_and_decisions` ✅
3. `20251006100000_backfill_breach_metadata` ✅

### Validation Steps
1. ✅ Backup created: `prisma/dev.sqlite.backup-20251010-084025`
2. ✅ Current migration status checked (3 migrations up to date)
3. ✅ Applied migrations listed (all 3 present)
4. ✅ Database reset to zero state (rollback successful)
5. ✅ All migrations reapplied (forward migration successful)
6. ✅ Schema validation passed (`prisma validate`)

### Database Structure Comparison
**Backup tables**: DashboardFact, DecisionLog, Session, _prisma_migrations
**Current tables**: DashboardFact, DecisionLog, Session, _prisma_migrations
**Result**: ✅ Structure matches (4/4 tables)

## CI Test Results (Current State)

### Unit Tests
**Status**: ✅ PASSING (24/25 tests, 1 skipped)
- Supabase memory tests: ✅ 4/4 passing
- Shopify client tests: ✅ 3/3 passing (retry logic validated)
- Chatwoot tests: ✅ 7/7 passing
- Shopify orders/inventory: ✅ 2/2 passing
- Feature flags: ✅ 4/4 passing
- GA ingest: ✅ 1/1 passing
- Sample test: ✅ 1/1 passing

### E2E Tests
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (1/3 passing, 2 blocked)
- Dashboard tile rendering: ✅ PASSING
- CX Escalations modal: ⚠️ BLOCKED (modal components not implemented)
- Sales Pulse modal: ⚠️ BLOCKED (modal components not implemented)

**Note**: Modal test failures are expected per feedback/qa.md - modal components are not yet implemented.

## Compliance & Evidence

### Evidence Artifacts
- SQLite migration log: `artifacts/migrations/20251012T083100Z_sqlite/forward-back.log`
- Database backup: `prisma/dev.sqlite.backup-20251010-084025`
- This validation report: `artifacts/qa/migration-validation-2025-10-12.md`

### Coordination
Per docs/directions/qa.md:23, sharing evidence with:
- **Deployment**: Migration validation results for staging deployment sign-off
- **Compliance**: Evidence of migration rollback capability and schema validation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ SQLite validation complete - no further action required
2. ⏳ Postgres validation - blocked on staging DSN connectivity (per feedback/qa.md:63)
3. ⏳ Rollback script ready for Postgres once connection resolves
4. ✅ Unit test suite green - CI pipeline operational
5. ⚠️ Modal E2E tests blocked - awaiting modal component implementation

## Sign-off

**SQLite Migration Validation**: ✅ APPROVED
- All forward/back migration tests passed
- Schema validation successful
- Table structure verified

**Postgres Migration Validation**: ⏳ PENDING
- Awaiting staging database connectivity
- Test procedure documented and ready to execute

**QA Agent**: Validated per docs/directions/qa.md:23
**Evidence Gate**: SQLite validation complete, Postgres pending connectivity
