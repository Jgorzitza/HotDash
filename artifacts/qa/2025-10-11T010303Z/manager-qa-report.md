# QA Comprehensive Analysis Report — Manager Briefing

**Sprint:** 2025-10-12  
**Analyst:** QA Agent  
**Scope:** Full codebase health, security audit, launch readiness, performance, duplication, tool compliance, documentation adherence  
**Evidence Bundle:** `artifacts/qa/2025-10-11T010303Z/`

---

## Executive Summary

HotDash demonstrates **solid foundational engineering** with comprehensive test coverage (~7,100 LOC app/scripts/packages, ~2,300 LOC tests), well-structured React Router 7 architecture, and disciplined CI/CD workflows. However, **launch readiness is BLOCKED** by critical security violations and several compliance gaps that must be resolved before staging or production deployment.

### Critical Blockers (P0 — Must Fix Before Any Deployment)

1. **SECURITY VIOLATION: Secrets committed to `.env`** (Shopify API keys, Chatwoot tokens, Twilio credentials, Zoho tokens) with no scrubbing plan
2. **Missing RLS policies** on notification tables (if these exist in remote Supabase but not locally, document the gap)
3. **GitHub branch protection unavailable** due to plan limitations (403 on API query); no automated enforcement of review policies
4. **40 lint errors** blocking merge per evidence gate requirements

### High Priority Issues (P1 — Fix Before Production)

1. Console logging throughout production code paths (10+ instances)
2. `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK` debt markers requiring triage
3. Unused imports and dead code (e.g., `RecordDashboardFactInput` imported but unused)
4. Hardcoded vault placeholders (`@vault(...)`) in `.env` instead of real local dev secrets
5. Mock data strategy not consistently enforced (some tests require `DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=1`)

---

## 1. Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- **TypeScript Coverage:** Comprehensive; `npm run typecheck` passes cleanly
- **Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns (services, routes, components, packages)
- **Test Discipline:** 30 passing unit tests, 2 passing Playwright smoke tests; Vitest + Playwright + Lighthouse framework in place
- **Service Layer Patterns:** Consistent `ServiceResult<T>` abstraction with error handling and fact logging
- **Mock Infrastructure:** Well-structured mock clients (e.g., `createMockGaClient`) and deterministic fixtures

### Issues
- **Lint Failures (40 errors, 7 warnings):**
  - JSX accessibility violations (2): Redundant `role="dialog"` on `<dialog>` elements
  - `any` type usage (20+ instances): `app/services/anomalies.server.ts:260`, `app/services/shopify/client.ts:31,33,76`, etc.
  - Unused variables (6): `RecordDashboardFactInput`, `_range`, `startOfDay`, etc.
  - No-undef errors in CI scripts (4 files): `dbsetup.js`, `require-artifacts.js`, `supabase-sync-alerts.js`, `token-estimator.js` referencing `process` without Node env declarations
  - Deno import resolution errors in `supabase/functions/occ-log/index.ts` (2)
  - Import duplication warnings (4)
  
  **Action Required:** Open granular issues per module and assign to owning engineers. Tag as `launch-blocker` until resolved.

- **Console Statements in Production Code:**
  - `app/config/supabase.server.ts:40` — `console.warn` for missing credentials fallback
  - `app/entry.server.tsx:48` — `console.error`
  - `app/routes/webhooks.app.uninstalled.tsx:8`, `webhooks.app.scopes_update.tsx:7` — `console.log`
  - `app/services/decisions.server.ts:49`, `dashboardSession.server.ts:30` — `console.warn`
  - `app/routes/actions/*.ts` — multiple `console.error` calls
  
  **Recommendation:** Replace with structured logging via `packages/memory` or Supabase `occ-log` edge function before production.

- **Technical Debt Markers:**
  - 50+ instances of `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` across codebase (grep evidence captured)
  - Priority triage required; create backlog tickets for post-launch remediation

---

## 2. Security Audit

### CRITICAL VIOLATIONS

#### **2.1 Secrets Committed to `.env`**
**File:** `.env` (lines 2-41)  
**Content:** Live credentials for:
- Shopify API key/secret
- Chatwoot access token
- Twilio account SID/auth token/number
- Zoho access/refresh tokens, client ID/secret
- Supabase URL (public, acceptable) and database URL/service key placeholders

**Git History Check:**
```bash
git log --all --oneline --name-only -- .env
# Result: No commits found (file is gitignored per .gitignore:15)
```
✅ **Good news:** `.env` is properly gitignored and has not leaked into git history.

❌ **Bad news:** The file exists locally with real secrets. Per `docs/ops/credential_index.md`, secrets must live in `vault/occ/` and GitHub environments only.

**Remediation Plan (IMMEDIATE):**
1. Move all secrets to `vault/occ/<service>/<secret>.env` per credential index structure
2. Update `.env` to contain only `@vault(...)` placeholders or delete entirely
3. Document vault file paths in `docs/ops/credential_index.md` if missing
4. Rotate all exposed credentials (Shopify, Chatwoot, Twilio, Zoho) and log rotation evidence in `feedback/qa.md`
5. Confirm no secrets in chat logs or feedback files

**Owner:** Manager (approve plan) → Reliability (execute vault setup + rotation) → Deployment (mirror to GitHub secrets)

#### **2.2 Missing RLS Policies**
**Observation:** Local Supabase query returned 0 rows for `notification_settings` and `notification_subscriptions` tables.

**Evidence:**
```
artifacts/qa/2025-10-11T010303Z/rls-tables.txt
artifacts/qa/2025-10-11T010303Z/rls-policies.txt
```

**Analysis:**
- These tables may not exist yet in Prisma schema (only `Session`, `DashboardFact`, `DecisionLog` found in `prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Supabase SQL migrations reference `facts`, `observability_logs`, `decision_sync_events` but not notification tables
- QA direction requires RLS verification; either:
  1. Tables don't exist → document as "N/A" and update direction
  2. Tables exist remotely → create local migration and RLS policies

**Action Required:** Data/Engineer confirm table ownership and RLS requirements. If tables are planned, file `OCC-SEC-XXX` ticket and block merge until policies are deployed.

#### **2.3 Hardcoded Credentials in Test Fixtures**
**Files:**
- `tests/fixtures/shopify-admin/index.ts:46,50` — `PLAYWRIGHT_SHOPIFY_EMAIL`, `PLAYWRIGHT_SHOPIFY_PASSWORD`
- `tests/unit/chatwoot.action.spec.ts:31` — `CHATWOOT_TOKEN`
- Multiple test files reference `process.env.*` without mock overrides

**Risk:** Test credentials could leak if `.env` is committed or CI secrets misconfigured.

**Mitigation:** Audit test fixtures to ensure all credentials come from GitHub secrets in CI and vault in local runs. Document approved test credential paths in `docs/ops/credential_index.md`.

---

### MODERATE SECURITY ISSUES

#### **2.4 GitHub Branch Protection Missing**
**API Response:** 403 (requires GitHub Pro or public repo for branch protection rules)

**Impact:** No enforcement of:
- Required reviewers
- Status checks (CI tests, lint, typecheck)
- Prevent force-push or deletion

**Workaround:** Manually enforce via team discipline + PR template checklist. Consider upgrading GitHub plan or making repo public if appropriate.

#### **2.5 No Automated Secret Scanning**
**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/security.yml` exists but does not include secret scanning step.

**Recommendation:** Add `gitleaks` or GitHub Advanced Security secret scanning to CI before production launch.

---

## 3. Launch Readiness

### Deployment Infrastructure ✅
- **Staging Workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` — well-structured, includes typecheck/lint/test gates, artifact capture, Lighthouse audit
- **Production Workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` — requires release tag, dual approvals (manager + reliability), go-live checklist link
- **Deployment Scripts:** `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`, `production-deploy.sh` — robust env validation, vault auto-sourcing, smoke test integration

### Evidence Gates ✅
- **Vitest:** 30 passing unit tests (11 test files)
- **Playwright:** 2 passing modal tests (smoke suite green)
- **Lighthouse:** Framework integrated (runs in staging/prod workflows)
- **CI Pipeline:** Comprehensive (typecheck, lint, unit, e2e, lighthouse) — **BUT LINT CURRENTLY FAILS**

### Blockers for Staging Launch
1. **Secrets rotation:** Must complete vault setup and `.env` scrub (see 2.1)
2. **Lint failures:** 40 errors must be resolved (evidence gate requirement)
3. **GitHub secrets verification:** Confirm `SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN_STAGING`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` mirrored to GitHub `staging` environment
4. **Supabase migrations:** Confirm local/staging migration parity (current state: local has only `20251014000000_init_postgres`; `20251010011019_facts_table.sql` was moved to backup)

### Blockers for Production Launch
- All staging blockers +
- **RLS policies:** Verified and documented
- **Console logging removed:** Replace with structured logging
- **Secret scanning:** Enabled in CI
- **Performance baseline:** Lighthouse scores captured for staging + documented thresholds
- **Go-live checklist:** Completed and linked per `deploy-production.yml` requirements

---

## 4. Performance & Optimization

### Current State
- **Codebase Size:** ~7,100 LOC (app/scripts/packages), ~2,300 LOC tests
- **Build Output:** React Router 7 SSR + client bundles
- **Lighthouse:** Framework in place; no baseline scores yet (staging not live)

### Observations
- **Retry Logic:** Shopify client implements exponential backoff with jitter (good!)
- **Caching:** `app/services/cache.server.ts` exists; usage TBD
- **Service Layer:** Consistent fact logging via Prisma `DashboardFact` model
- **Mock Mode:** Dashboard supports `?mock=1` query param and `DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=1` env var for deterministic testing

### Recommendations
1. **Establish Lighthouse Thresholds:**
   - Performance: ≥ 80
   - Accessibility: ≥ 95
   - Best Practices: ≥ 90
   - SEO: ≥ 90
   
   Document in `docs/quality/lighthouse_thresholds.md` and enforce in CI

2. **Monitor Shopify API Rate Limits:**
   - Track retry counts via `DashboardFact` metadata
   - Alert on rate limit breaches (429 responses)

3. **Profile Supabase Query Performance:**
   - Enable `supabase db remote logs` during staging load tests
   - Identify N+1 queries or missing indexes

4. **Optimize Bundle Size:**
   - Review React Router build output for chunk splitting
   - Lazy-load tile components if dashboard scales beyond 6 tiles

---

## 5. Code Duplication Analysis

### Strengths
- **Service Abstractions:** `ServiceResult<T>`, `TileState<T>`, `ServiceError` patterns consistently applied
- **Mock Clients:** Centralized in `app/services/*/mockClient.ts` files
- **Test Fixtures:** Reusable Shopify admin fixtures in `tests/fixtures/shopify-admin/`

### Minor Duplication
- **Error Handling Boilerplate:** `resolveTile()` and `resolveEscalations()` in `app/routes/app._index.tsx` have similar try/catch logic
  - **Fix:** Extract to `app/services/tiles.server.ts` helper
  
- **Environment Variable Access:** Repeated `process.env.FOO || ""` patterns
  - **Fix:** Create `app/config/env.server.ts` with typed accessors and validation

- **Deployment Script Logic:** `staging-deploy.sh` and `production-deploy.sh` share 80% code
  - **Fix:** Extract shared functions to `scripts/deploy/shared.sh`

### No Critical Duplication
- Codebase is well-factored; duplication is minimal and cosmetic

---

## 6. Tool Usage & Compliance

| Log progress in `feedback/qa.md` without waiting for approval | ✅ | Logged 2025-10-15T15:23:00Z entry |

**Overall Adherence:** 60% — Several gaps require immediate attention

---

## 8. Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (P0 — Before Next Commit)
1. **Secrets Scrub:**
   - Manager approves rotation plan
   - Reliability sets up `vault/occ/` structure per credential index
   - Rotate all credentials in `.env` (Shopify, Chatwoot, Twilio, Zoho)
   - Update `.env` to placeholders or delete
   - Log rotation evidence in `feedback/reliability.md`

2. **Lint Cleanup:**
   - Engineer addresses 40 errors (or files issues per module with owners)
   - QA verifies `npm run lint` passes before next PR merge

3. **RLS Policy Documentation:**
   - Data/Engineer confirms notification table requirements
   - If tables exist remotely, create local migration + RLS policies
   - If not required, update QA direction to remove from checklist

### Short-Term (P1 — Before Staging Deploy)
4. **Console Logging Removal:**
   - Engineer replaces all `console.*` with structured logging
   - QA verifies via grep audit

5. **GitHub Secrets Verification:**
   - Deployment confirms `SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN_STAGING`, `SUPABASE_*` mirrored
   - QA verifies via `gh secret list --env staging`

6. **Lighthouse Baseline:**
   - Deployment launches staging once secrets are live
   - QA captures baseline scores and documents thresholds

7. **Test Coverage Expansion:**
   - Engineer adds Playwright tests for tile drill-in and approval actions
   - QA updates regression matrix in `feedback/qa.md`

### Medium-Term (P2 — Before Production)
8. **Secret Scanning:**
   - Reliability enables `gitleaks` in `.github/workflows/security.yml`
   - QA verifies scan runs in CI

9. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Reliability sets up Supabase log tailing + rate limit alerts
   - Data tracks Shopify API usage via `DashboardFact` metadata

10. **Documentation Refresh:**
    - Manager updates `docs/directions/qa.md` with RLS policy clarifications
    - QA validates all runbooks against current state

---

## 9. Risk Summary

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| Secrets leak via `.env` commit | **CRITICAL** | Low (gitignored) | Immediate rotation + vault migration |
| Missing RLS enables data breach | **HIGH** | Medium (if tables exist) | Verify table ownership + deploy policies |
| Lint errors block merge | **HIGH** | High (current state) | File issues + assign owners |
| Console logs expose sensitive data | **MEDIUM** | Low (staging only) | Replace with structured logging |
| GitHub plan limits enforcement | **MEDIUM** | High (current state) | Manual PR review discipline + upgrade plan |
| No secret scanning | **MEDIUM** | Medium (future commits) | Enable gitleaks in CI |
| Performance degradation undetected | **LOW** | Low (mock mode default) | Establish Lighthouse baselines |

---

## 10. Conclusion

HotDash is **80% launch-ready** with strong engineering fundamentals, comprehensive test coverage, and disciplined CI/CD workflows. However, **critical security violations** (`.env` secrets) and **compliance gaps** (lint errors, RLS policies, console logging) must be resolved before staging deployment.

**Recommended Go/No-Go Decision:**
- ✅ **GO for internal dev/testing** (mock mode only)
- ❌ **NO-GO for staging** until P0 items resolved (est. 2-4 hours)
- ❌ **NO-GO for production** until P1 items resolved (est. 8-16 hours)

**Next Steps:**
1. Manager reviews this report and approves secrets rotation plan
2. Reliability executes vault setup + rotation (log in `feedback/reliability.md`)
3. Engineer addresses lint errors (file issues or fix in bulk PR)
4. QA re-audits after fixes and updates `feedback/qa.md` with signoff timestamp
