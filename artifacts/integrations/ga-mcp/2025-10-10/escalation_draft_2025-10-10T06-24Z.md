# OCC-INF-221 Escalation Draft — Prepared 2025-10-10 02:55 UTC

@Jordan Malik — following up on OCC-INF-221. Infrastructure missed the 17:00 UTC credential ETA and we still lack the GA MCP host + service bundle needed to unblock the go-live checklist.

We are now inside the escalation window. Please provide either (a) the credential package (`GA_MCP_HOST`, `GA_MCP_CREDENTIALS`) or (b) a written ETA / fallback guidance before 2025-10-10 09:00 UTC. Without this we cannot schedule GA MCP validation, the readiness dashboard stays red, and leadership will escalate to the CIO queue at 09:00 UTC.

Reliability is staged to run the MCP auth helper the moment the bundle lands, and compliance is holding DPIA updates to close immediately after. Let us know if an alternate path (temporary token or manual handoff) can be delivered sooner.

Thanks — Integrations
