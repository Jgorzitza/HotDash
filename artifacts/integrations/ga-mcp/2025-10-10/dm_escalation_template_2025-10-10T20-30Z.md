# OCC-INF-221 Escalation Draft — 2025-10-10 20:30Z

## Channel
Direct message to Jordan Malik (Infrastructure Duty Lead)

## Draft Message
> Hi Jordan — following up on OCC-INF-221. We still need the GA MCP host + credentials to lift mock mode. Could you share the delivery ETA before 21:00Z? If infra is blocked, please point me to the fallback so we can update readiness dashboards and notify the manager.

## Attachment
- Reference `artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/ping_infra_2025-10-10T19-25Z.md` for the public channel ping.

## Next Step
- If DM does not produce response within 30 minutes, escalate to manager per direction with both artifacts linked.
