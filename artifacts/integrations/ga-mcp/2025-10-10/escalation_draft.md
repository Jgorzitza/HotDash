# OCC-INF-221 Escalation Draft — Prepared 2025-10-10 06:24 UTC

@Jordan Malik — checking on OCC-INF-221. We still do not have the GA MCP host + service bundle that was due at 17:00 UTC, and the CIO escalation window opens at 09:00 UTC.

Please provide either (a) the credential package (`GA_MCP_HOST`, `GA_MCP_CREDENTIALS`) or (b) a written ETA/fallback before 09:00 UTC so we can schedule GA MCP validation and keep the readiness dashboard accurate. Without an update we will escalate to the CIO queue at 09:00 UTC per manager direction.

Reliability is staged to run the MCP auth helper the moment the bundle lands; compliance is waiting to log DPIA evidence. Let us know if a temporary token or manual handoff is faster.

Thanks — Integrations
