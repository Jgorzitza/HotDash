# CIO Escalation - GA MCP Credential Delivery (OCC-INF-221)

**Date:** 2025-10-11 00:58 UTC  
**Escalation Trigger:** Past 09:00 UTC deadline without infra response  
**Original Request:** 2025-10-07 (4 days overdue)  
**Priority:** Critical - Blocking production go-live checklist  

## Issue Summary
The GA MCP production credential delivery (ticket OCC-INF-221) has exceeded all escalation deadlines with no response from infrastructure team. This is blocking the entire Google Analytics integration go-live and affecting the sprint delivery timeline.

## Timeline of Attempts
- **2025-10-07**: Initial request submitted to #infra-requests (Jordan Malik)
- **2025-10-07**: Direct message follow-up to Jordan Malik
- **2025-10-08**: Manager escalation (Priya Singh) via #occ-standup  
- **2025-10-10 19:25Z**: Follow-up ping requesting ETA by 21:00Z
- **2025-10-10 20:30Z**: Expected escalation window (missed)
- **2025-10-11 09:00Z**: CIO escalation deadline (passed without action)
- **2025-10-11 00:58Z**: Current escalation (16+ hours past deadline)

## Required Deliverables (Still Pending)
1. `GA_MCP_HOST` - Base URL for MCP gateway
2. `GA_MCP_CREDENTIALS` - Service account key/auth token bundle  
3. `GA_PROPERTY_ID` - Production property ID confirmation

## Business Impact
- Production dashboard limited to mock data (GA_USE_MOCK=1)
- 24-hour go-live checklist cannot commence
- Sprint milestone at risk
- Customer analytics features unavailable

## Requested Action
1. Immediate assignment of OCC-INF-221 to available infrastructure resource
2. Expedited credential delivery with ETA within 4 business hours
3. Escalation protocol review to prevent similar delays

## Next Steps if No Response by 2025-10-11 04:00 UTC
- Secondary CIO escalation with manager CC
- Fallback planning activation
- Risk assessment for sprint re-scoping
