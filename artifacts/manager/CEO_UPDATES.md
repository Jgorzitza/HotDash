### 🚨 CURRENT BLOCKERS

**P0 (Launch Blocking)**:
1. **Build Failure** - Engineer fixing (import error), ETA 14:00 UTC
2. **RLS Security** - Data fixing (51 tables), ETA 16:00 UTC

**P1 (Launch Critical)**:

### 👤 MANAGER SELF-ASSESSMENT

**Performance**: 7.5/10 (Honest assessment)

**What I Did Well**:
1. ✅ Caught the partial execution mistake and corrected it completely
2. ✅ Took full ownership of the failure without excuses
3. ✅ Executed complete shutdown checklist after correction
4. ✅ All 18 agents now have clear priorities (vs 1/18 before)

**What I Screwed Up (Brutally Honest)**:
1. ❌ **MAJOR**: Only partially executed my own shutdown checklist
   - Only cleaned 1/7 bloated files
   - Only added START HERE NOW to 1/18 agents
   - Missed 13 violation files in root directory
   - **Root Cause**: Rushed through shutdown, didn't follow my own process
   - **How to Prevent**: Treat shutdown checklist as MANDATORY, not optional

**Process Improvements for Next Run**:
1. ✅ **Implemented**: Use shutdown checklist as literal checklist (check each item)
2. ✅ **Implemented**: Verify "ALL" means "ALL" (not "1 and assume rest done")
3. 🔄 **Next**: Set up automated verification script for shutdown completeness
4. 🔄 **Next**: CEO should expect shutdown report before approving (accountability)

**Changes Implemented This Session**:
1. ✅ Complete violation cleanup (13 files removed)
2. ✅ Complete direction file cleanup (7 files cleaned)
3. ✅ Complete START HERE NOW rollout (18/18 agents)
4. ✅ Agent Alignment Analysis (documented active/paused/standby)
5. ✅ This CEO Update (comprehensive reporting)

**North Star Alignment**: 8/10
- ✅ Focused agents on P0 blockers (launch-critical)
- ✅ Paused non-essential work (9 agents)
- ⚠️ Should have caught Engineer's training data reliance earlier
- ✅ All work supports operator value and 5 tiles
