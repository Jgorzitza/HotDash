### 📊 OVERALL PROJECT STATUS

**Launch Target**: Oct 13-15, 2025  
**Current Status**: ⚠️ DELAYED - P0 build blocker must be fixed  
**Completion**: 75% → Launch Ready

**Breakdown**:
- Infrastructure: 90% (Services deployed, databases ready)
- Core Features (5 tiles): 40% (Data pipelines partial, UI incomplete)
- Code Quality: 70% (0 TypeScript errors ✅, but build fails ❌)

### 📊 MANAGER PERFORMANCE

**My Score This Session**: 7.5/10

**What I Did Well**:
1. Created comprehensive startup/shutdown system (6 checklists)
2. Protected critical files from deletion (CODEOWNERS)
3. Massive direction cleanup (engineer: 2952 → 243 lines)

**What I Screwed Up**:
1. Almost didn't commit work immediately - CEO had to remind me
   - Why: Focused on creation, forgot protection
   - Fix: Always commit critical files immediately after creation

**Process Changes Implemented**:
- Startup/shutdown checklists for agents and manager
- Performance review system
- CEO update system (this file)
- Priority decision matrix
- File protection (CODEOWNERS)
- Direction file size limits (200 recommended, 400 strict)

**Metrics**:
- Blocker response time: <5 min (identified build failure immediately)
- Direction files cleaned: 1/7 that need it (14% - need to finish)
- Agents redirected: 0 (not yet reviewed all)
- Session duration: 4.5 hours
- Agent utilization: Unknown (need to assess)

**Effectiveness**:
- Did I identify blockers proactively? ✅ YES - Build blocker found immediately
- Did I maintain clean directions? ⏳ PARTIAL - 1/7 cleaned (need to finish)
- Did I keep agents focused? ⏳ PARTIAL - Tools created, not yet applied
- Did I remove blockers quickly? ❌ NO - Identified but not yet removed (assigned to Engineer)
- Did I align work to North Star? ✅ YES - Priority matrix enforces this

**Improvements for Next Session**:
1. Complete direction cleanup for remaining 6 bloated files
2. Apply performance review to all 18 agents (not just top performers)
3. Verify blocker assignments are being executed

---

### 🎯 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

**Critical Path**:
1. Verify Engineer fixed build failure (14:00 UTC check)
2. Clean remaining 6 bloated direction files (qa.md 479 lines, etc.)
3. Review all 18 agent feedback for overnight work
4. Assign priorities based on current state (not yesterday's state)

**Agent Focus Areas**:
- Engineer: P0 build fix (30 min), then Approval UI
- QA: Test build when fixed, run E2E tests
- Data: Fix RLS security (need to assign clearly)
- Others: Standing by or monitoring until P0 clear

**Manager Focus**:
- Finish direction cleanup (6 more files)
- Create first full agent performance review
- Monitor build fix execution

---

**Session Complete**: 2025-10-13T12:45:00Z  
**Next Update**: Next shutdown (tonight or tomorrow)
