## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **Good Foundation** - Clear technical error messages with actionable "How to fix" sections

**Key Strengths**:
- ✅ Consistent emoji usage (❌ for errors, ✅ for success, 💡 for help)
- ✅ "How to fix" sections provide clear next steps
- ✅ Examples included in most error messages
- ✅ Links to runbook documentation

**Opportunities for Improvement**:
- 🔧 **Formatting**: Multiline errors could be more readable in CI logs
- 🔧 **Tone**: Balance technical accuracy with friendly guidance
- 🔧 **Specificity**: Link to exact runbook sections (with anchors)
- 🔧 **Visual Hierarchy**: Better structure for multi-part error messages

**Impact**: These scripts are CI merge blockers - poor UX = frustrated developers + slower velocity

## Detailed Review: verify-mcp-evidence.js

### Error 1: MCP Evidence Section Missing (Line 34)

**Current**:
```
❌ MCP Evidence section missing from PR body. Required format:

## MCP Evidence
- artifacts/<agent>/<date>/mcp/<tool>.jsonl

Or for non-code changes:

## MCP Evidence
No MCP usage - non-code change (docs/config only)
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Clear requirement
- ⚠️ Could emphasize WHERE to add this (in PR description)
- ⚠️ Could provide clickable link to example PR

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ MCP Evidence section missing from PR description

Your PR description needs an "## MCP Evidence" section to pass CI checks.

📝 Add this to your PR description:

## MCP Evidence
- artifacts/<your-agent>/<today>/mcp/<tool-name>.jsonl

Example:
- artifacts/engineer/2025-10-22/mcp/react-router.jsonl

📚 Non-code changes (docs/config only):
## MCP Evidence
No MCP usage - non-code change (docs/config only)

💡 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#section-21-mcp-evidence
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added "from PR description" for clarity
- ✅ Emphasized WHERE to add it ("📝 Add this to your PR description")
- ✅ Used `<your-agent>` and `<today>` placeholders (more intuitive)
- ✅ Added concrete example with current date
- ✅ Improved visual hierarchy with icons
- ✅ Added anchor link to specific runbook section

---

### Error 2: No JSONL Paths Found (Line 53)

**Current**:
```
❌ No MCP evidence JSONL paths found in PR body.

Expected format:
- artifacts/<agent>/<date>/mcp/<tool>.jsonl

Example:
- artifacts/devops/2025-10-21/mcp/ci-guards.jsonl
- artifacts/engineer/2025-10-21/mcp/react-router.jsonl
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Good examples
- ⚠️ Doesn't explain HOW to create these files
- ⚠️ Could be overwhelming (2 examples but no context)

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ MCP Evidence section found, but no JSONL file paths listed

You have an "## MCP Evidence" section, but it doesn't list any .jsonl files.

📝 Expected format (bullet list):
- artifacts/<agent>/<date>/mcp/<tool-name>.jsonl

✅ Good example:
## MCP Evidence
- artifacts/engineer/2025-10-22/mcp/shopify-dev.jsonl
- artifacts/engineer/2025-10-22/mcp/context7.jsonl

❌ Bad example:
## MCP Evidence
Used Context7 for React docs (missing file path!)

💡 How to create JSONL files:
1. Log MCP calls during your work session
2. Commit files to artifacts/<agent>/<date>/mcp/
3. List committed files in PR description

📚 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#mcp-evidence
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Clarified the specific issue ("section found, but...")
- ✅ Added "Good example" vs "Bad example" (shows what NOT to do)
- ✅ Added "How to create JSONL files" step-by-step
- ✅ More contextual (explains the workflow)
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy

---

### Error 3: File Not Found (Line 67)

**Current**:
```
❌ MCP evidence file not found: ${filePath}

File must be committed to the repository.
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Clear error
- ⚠️ Doesn't help debug WHY (typo? not staged? not committed?)
- ⚠️ No next steps

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ MCP evidence file not found: ${filePath}

The file is listed in your PR description, but it's not in the repository.

🔍 Common causes:
1. File exists locally but wasn't staged:    git add ${filePath}
2. File was staged but not committed:        git commit
3. Typo in PR description (check file name)
4. File in wrong directory (check path)

💡 To fix:
1. Verify file exists:  ls ${filePath}
2. Stage the file:      git add ${filePath}
3. Commit changes:      git commit -m "Add MCP evidence"
4. Push to PR:          git push

📚 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#committing-evidence
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Explained "why" it happens (not just "what")
- ✅ Listed common causes (helps debugging)
- ✅ Provided exact commands to fix
- ✅ Step-by-step resolution path
- ✅ More empathetic tone ("common causes" vs "you did it wrong")

---

### Error 4: File is Empty (Line 74)

**Current**:
```
❌ MCP evidence file is empty: ${filePath}

Each MCP tool call must be logged as a JSON line.
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Clear problem
- ⚠️ Doesn't show example format
- ⚠️ No guidance on what to log

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ MCP evidence file is empty: ${filePath}

The file exists but has no content. You need to log your MCP tool calls.

📝 Expected format (one JSON object per line):
{"tool":"shopify-dev","doc_ref":"polaris-button","timestamp":"2025-10-22T10:00:00Z","purpose":"Learn Button props"}
{"tool":"context7","doc_ref":"/chartjs/chart.js","timestamp":"2025-10-22T10:15:00Z","purpose":"Chart accessibility"}

✅ Minimum required fields:
- tool: "shopify-dev" | "context7" | "web-search"
- timestamp: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- purpose: Why you used this tool (1 sentence)

💡 To fix:
1. Append MCP calls to the file as you work
2. Use echo or append mode:  echo '{"tool":...}' >> ${filePath}
3. Commit the updated file

📚 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#logging-mcp-calls
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Provided concrete example (2 lines showing variety)
- ✅ Listed minimum required fields explicitly
- ✅ Showed how to append to file (echo command)
- ✅ Better visual structure (format, fields, how-to)

---

### Error 5: Invalid JSON Line (Line 103)

**Current**:
```
❌ ${filePath} - Line ${idx + 1} is not valid JSON: ${error.message}

Expected format:
{"tool":"shopify-dev|context7|web-search","doc_ref":"<url>","timestamp":"2025-10-21T14:30:00Z","purpose":"Learn X"}
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Shows line number
- ⚠️ Generic format (pipe-separated options confusing)
- ⚠️ Doesn't help fix JSON syntax errors

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ JSON syntax error in ${filePath} (Line ${idx + 1})

Error: ${error.message}

🔍 The line has a JSON formatting problem (missing quote, comma, brace, etc.)

✅ Valid example:
{"tool":"shopify-dev","doc_ref":"polaris-button","timestamp":"2025-10-22T10:00:00Z","purpose":"Learn Button props"}

❌ Common mistakes:
- Missing quotes:          {"tool":shopify-dev}  ← needs "shopify-dev"
- Trailing comma:          {"tool":"x",}         ← remove comma before }
- Single quotes:           {'tool':'x'}          ← use double quotes "
- Missing timestamp:       {"tool":"x"}          ← timestamp required

💡 To fix:
1. Open ${filePath} in your editor
2. Go to line ${idx + 1}
3. Check for missing quotes, commas, or braces
4. Validate JSON: cat ${filePath} | jq .  (shows which line is broken)

📚 JSON formatting help: https://jsonlint.com
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Friendlier tone ("has a JSON formatting problem" vs technical jargon)
- ✅ Listed common mistakes with examples (visual comparison)
- ✅ Provided `jq` command for validation
- ✅ External link to JSON linter (helpful for non-technical users)
- ✅ Step-by-step fix instructions

---

### Success Message (Line 107)

**Current**:
```
✅ Valid JSONL: ${filePath} (${lines.length} entries)
```

**UX Assessment**: ✅ **Perfect** - Clear, concise, informative

**Recommendation**: No changes needed. Consider adding this if you want more detail:
```
✅ Valid JSONL: ${filePath}
   📊 ${lines.length} MCP tool call(s) logged
```

---

### Error 6: PR_BODY Not Set (Line 117)

**Current**:
```
❌ PR_BODY environment variable not set.

This script must be run in GitHub Actions with PR context.
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Clear cause
- ⚠️ Doesn't explain WHO might see this
- ⚠️ No troubleshooting steps

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ PR_BODY environment variable not set

This script is designed to run in GitHub Actions CI, not locally.

🤔 Are you trying to:
1. Test locally? Use: export PR_BODY="$(cat test-pr-body.md)"
2. Debug CI failure? Check GitHub Actions logs for PR context
3. Run in CI? This env var is auto-set by GitHub Actions

💡 For local testing:
1. Create test-pr-body.md with your PR template
2. export PR_BODY="$(cat test-pr-body.md)"
3. node scripts/ci/verify-mcp-evidence.js

📚 See: .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml (how this is called in CI)
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Explained use case (CI vs local)
- ✅ Provided local testing workaround
- ✅ Referenced the workflow file (shows how it's used)
- ✅ More helpful for debugging

---

### "How to Fix" Section (Lines 141-145)

**Current**:
```
💡 To fix this:
1. Ensure you've logged all MCP tool calls to JSONL files
2. Commit the JSONL files to artifacts/<agent>/<date>/mcp/
3. List the files in the PR body under '## MCP Evidence'

See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md (Section 2.1)
```

**UX Assessment**: ✅ **Good** - Clear steps, but could be more specific

**Recommendation**:
```
💡 To fix this:
1. Log MCP tool calls:  echo '{"tool":"shopify-dev",...}' >> artifacts/<agent>/2025-10-22/mcp/tool.jsonl
2. Commit evidence:     git add artifacts/ && git commit -m "Add MCP evidence"
3. List in PR body:     Edit PR description, add "## MCP Evidence" section

✅ Example PR body section:
## MCP Evidence
- artifacts/engineer/2025-10-22/mcp/shopify-dev.jsonl
- artifacts/engineer/2025-10-22/mcp/context7.jsonl

📚 Full guide: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#section-21-mcp-evidence
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added concrete commands (copy-paste ready)
- ✅ Showed example PR body section
- ✅ Added anchor to specific section
- ✅ More actionable (exact commands vs descriptions)

---

## Detailed Review: verify-heartbeat.js

### Error 1: Heartbeat Section Missing (Line 33)

**Current**:
```
❌ Heartbeat section missing from PR body. Required format:

## Heartbeat
- artifacts/<agent>/<date>/heartbeat.ndjson

Or for short tasks:

## Heartbeat
<2h single session - heartbeat not required
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Clear requirement
- ⚠️ Could explain WHY heartbeats are needed
- ⚠️ "<2h single session" phrasing could be clearer

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ Heartbeat section missing from PR description

Heartbeat files help track progress on long-running tasks (>2 hours).

📝 For tasks longer than 2 hours, add this to your PR description:

## Heartbeat
- artifacts/<your-agent>/<today>/heartbeat.ndjson

Example:
- artifacts/devops/2025-10-22/heartbeat.ndjson

📚 For short tasks (<2 hours), add this instead:

## Heartbeat
Single session (<2 hours) - heartbeat not required

❓ Why heartbeats?
- Ensures agent is making progress (not stuck)
- Provides transparency for long tasks
- Catches stale work before merge

💡 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#section-22-heartbeat-logging
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Explained purpose ("Why heartbeats?")
- ✅ Clearer exemption phrasing ("Single session (<2 hours)")
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Added context (not just "what" but "why")

---

### Error 2: No Heartbeat File Path Found (Line 51)

**Current**:
```
❌ No heartbeat file path found in PR body.

Expected format:
- artifacts/<agent>/<date>/heartbeat.ndjson

Example:
- artifacts/devops/2025-10-21/heartbeat.ndjson
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Clear format
- ⚠️ Doesn't explain how to create the file
- ⚠️ No mention of "what goes in it"

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ Heartbeat section found, but no .ndjson file path listed

You have a "## Heartbeat" section, but it doesn't list a heartbeat file.

📝 Expected format (bullet list):
- artifacts/<agent>/<date>/heartbeat.ndjson

✅ Good example:
## Heartbeat
- artifacts/devops/2025-10-22/heartbeat.ndjson

❌ Bad example:
## Heartbeat
Logging progress every 15 min (missing file path!)

💡 How to create heartbeat file:
1. Start task, append first entry:  
   echo '{"timestamp":"2025-10-22T10:00:00Z","task":"TASK-001","status":"doing","progress":"10%"}' >> artifacts/<agent>/2025-10-22/heartbeat.ndjson
   
2. Every 15 minutes, append progress:  
   echo '{"timestamp":"...","task":"TASK-001","status":"doing","progress":"40%"}' >> ...
   
3. When done, append final entry:  
   echo '{"timestamp":"...","task":"TASK-001","status":"done","progress":"100%"}' >> ...

4. Commit file and list in PR description

📚 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#heartbeat-format
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Good vs Bad example (visual learning)
- ✅ Step-by-step file creation (with commands)
- ✅ Showed workflow (start → progress → done)
- ✅ More actionable (exact commands)

---

### Error 3: Heartbeat Stale (Line 115)

**Current**:
```
❌ Heartbeat stale: Last update was ${minutesAgo.toFixed(1)} minutes ago (>15 minute threshold)

For tasks >2 hours, heartbeat must be updated every 15 minutes.

If task is complete, set status to "done" in last heartbeat entry.
```

**UX Issues**:
- ✅ Shows exact time since last heartbeat
- ⚠️ Doesn't explain HOW to update
- ⚠️ Could be friendlier (feels punitive)

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ Heartbeat is stale (last update: ${minutesAgo.toFixed(1)} minutes ago)

Heartbeats must be updated every 15 minutes for tasks >2 hours.

🕒 Last heartbeat: ${lastHeartbeat.timestamp}
📊 Current status: ${lastHeartbeat.status}
⏰ Time since last update: ${minutesAgo.toFixed(1)} minutes (threshold: 15 min)

💡 To fix:

If you're still working:
1. Append new heartbeat:  
   echo '{"timestamp":"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)","task":"${lastHeartbeat.task}","status":"doing","progress":"60%"}' >> <heartbeat-file>
   
2. Commit and push:  
   git add <heartbeat-file> && git commit -m "Update heartbeat" && git push

If you're done:
1. Mark task as complete:  
   echo '{"timestamp":"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)","task":"${lastHeartbeat.task}","status":"done","progress":"100%"}' >> <heartbeat-file>
   
2. Commit and push

❓ Why 15 minutes?
- Ensures you're not stuck on a blocker
- Provides visibility for long-running work
- Catches abandoned tasks before merge

📚 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#heartbeat-frequency
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ More informative (shows last timestamp, current status)
- ✅ Provided exact commands (with date formatting)
- ✅ Split "still working" vs "done" scenarios
- ✅ Explained rationale ("Why 15 minutes?")
- ✅ More empathetic tone (less punitive)

---

### Success Messages (Lines 108-124)

**Current**:
```
Last heartbeat: ${lastHeartbeat.timestamp} (${minutesAgo.toFixed(1)} minutes ago)
Status: ${lastHeartbeat.status}
Total heartbeat entries: ${lines.length}
✅ Task marked as done - staleness check skipped
✅ Heartbeat fresh - within 15 minute threshold
✅ Heartbeat OK: ${lines.length} entries
```

**UX Assessment**: ✅ **Excellent** - Informative and reassuring

**Recommendation**: Minor enhancement for readability:
```
✅ Heartbeat OK
   🕒 Last update: ${lastHeartbeat.timestamp} (${minutesAgo.toFixed(1)} min ago)
   📊 Status: ${lastHeartbeat.status}
   📈 Total entries: ${lines.length}
   ${lastHeartbeat.status === 'done' ? '🎉 Task complete - staleness check skipped' : '✅ Fresh - within 15 min threshold'}
```

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy (indentation)
- ✅ Icons for quick scanning
- ✅ Conditional emoji for "done" status (🎉 celebration)

---

## Cross-File Improvements

### 1. Consistent Link Format

**Current**: `See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md (Section 2.1)`

**Recommendation**: Use anchors for direct navigation:
```
📚 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#section-21-mcp-evidence
📚 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#section-22-heartbeat-logging
```

**Benefit**: If runbook is published to web/docs site, anchors enable direct deep-linking

---

### 2. Emoji Standardization

**Current Usage**:
- ❌ Errors
- ✅ Success
- 💡 Help/Tips

**Recommendation**: Add more semantic icons:
```
❌ Error/Failure
✅ Success/Pass
💡 Tips/How to fix
🔍 Debugging/Investigation
📝 Format/Template
📚 Documentation link
🕒 Time/Timestamp
📊 Status/Progress
🎉 Celebration (task complete)
⚠️ Warning (non-critical)
❓ Explanation/Why
```

**Benefit**: Faster visual scanning in CI logs, especially mobile

---

### 3. Command Examples

**Current**: Abstract descriptions

**Recommendation**: Provide copy-paste ready commands in every error:
```
❌ Instead of: "File must be committed"
✅ Use: "File must be committed:  git add <file> && git commit"
```

**Benefit**: Reduces friction, speeds up fixes, fewer support requests

---

### 4. Visual Hierarchy

**Current**: Flat text blocks

**Recommendation**: Use indentation + icons for structure:
```
❌ Error summary (one line)

🔍 Details:
   - What went wrong
   - Why it matters

💡 To fix:
   1. First step
   2. Second step
   
📚 See: <link>
```

**Benefit**: Easier to skim in CI logs, clearer action path

---

## Sample "Before & After" Comparison

### Example: MCP Evidence File Not Found

**Before** (Current):
```
❌ MCP evidence file not found: artifacts/engineer/2025-10-21/mcp/react-router.jsonl

File must be committed to the repository.

💡 To fix this:
1. Ensure you've logged all MCP tool calls to JSONL files
2. Commit the JSONL files to artifacts/<agent>/<date>/mcp/
3. List the files in the PR body under '## MCP Evidence'
```

**After** (Recommended):
```
❌ MCP evidence file not found: artifacts/engineer/2025-10-21/mcp/react-router.jsonl

The file is listed in your PR description, but it's not in the repository.

🔍 Common causes:
1. File exists locally but wasn't staged
2. File was staged but not committed
3. Typo in PR description (check file name)

💡 To fix:
1. Verify file exists:  ls artifacts/engineer/2025-10-21/mcp/react-router.jsonl
2. Stage the file:      git add artifacts/engineer/2025-10-21/mcp/react-router.jsonl
3. Commit changes:      git commit -m "Add MCP evidence"
4. Push to PR:          git push

📚 See: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md#committing-evidence
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Explains common causes (debugging help)
- ✅ Provides exact commands (copy-paste ready)
- ✅ Step-by-step resolution (clear action path)
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy (icons + sections)
- ✅ More empathetic tone (not just "you failed")

---

## Testing Recommendations

### How to Test These Changes

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify error message formatting (no breaking changes)
   ```bash
   npm test scripts/ci/verify-mcp-evidence.spec.js
   npm test scripts/ci/verify-heartbeat.spec.js
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: Run against sample PR bodies
   ```bash
   export PR_BODY="$(cat fixtures/pr-body-missing-mcp.md)"
   node scripts/ci/verify-mcp-evidence.js
   # Verify error message is helpful
   ```

3. **User Testing**: Ask 2-3 developers to:
   - Read the error message
   - Attempt to fix it without external help
   - Rate clarity (1-5 scale)

4. **CI Log Review**: After deploying, review GitHub Actions logs
   - Are errors easy to find?
   - Are commands copy-paste ready?
   - Do developers ask fewer support questions?
