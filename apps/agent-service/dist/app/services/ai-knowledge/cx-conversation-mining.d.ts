/**
 * CX Conversation Mining Service
 *
 * Mines CX conversations to detect recurring themes and generate product improvement actions
 *
 * Growth Engine: CX â†’ Product Loop
 *
 * Process:
 * 1. Extract Chatwoot conversations (last 30 days)
 * 2. Sanitize PII (remove emails, phones, addresses, etc.)
 * 3. Embed sanitized conversations into pgvector
 * 4. Detect recurring themes using similarity search
 * 5. Generate Action cards for Product agent
 *
 * Security: NO PII stored in embeddings (sanitized before embedding)
