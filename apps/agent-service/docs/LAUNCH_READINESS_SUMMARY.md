## ⚠️ Remaining Work

### 1. MCP Server Deployment (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Production MCP server missing llama-workflow dependencies  
**Impact**: Deployed query_support tool fails with "Cannot find package 'commander'"  
**Resolution**: 
- Option A: Bundle llama-workflow dependencies in deployment
- Option B: Refactor MCP server to import functions directly (recommended)
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours

### 2. Approval Queue Frontend (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status**: Design complete, implementation needed  
**Requirements**:
- React + TypeScript frontend
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Keyboard shortcuts for operator efficiency
- Mobile responsive design
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days for MVP, 1 week for polish

### 3. Agent SDK Integration Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status**: Individual components tested, end-to-end pending  
**Test Scenarios**:
- Triage → Order Support handoff
- Triage → Product Q&A handoff
- RAG citation in responses
- Approval queue workflow
- Feedback loop collection
**Estimated Time**: 1 day

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Three-Tier Confidence System
- **High (90-100%)**: Fast-track approval
- **Medium (70-89%)**: Standard review
- **Low (<70%)**: Careful verification

Enables efficient operator prioritization.

### 2. Source Citation in Responses
Every fact cited with:
- Source title
- Relevance score
- URL/document reference

Builds customer trust and enables fact-checking.

### 3. Learning Loop Architecture
- Track operator edits
- Measure edit distance
- Identify common modifications
- Retrain prompts based on patterns

Continuous improvement without manual intervention.

### 4. Agent Specialization
Instead of one generalist agent:
- **Triage**: Fast classification
- **Order Support**: Transaction focus
- **Product Q&A**: Deep product knowledge

Better accuracy through specialization.

## 🔒 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **MCP Server Failure**: Fallback to manual operator workflow
2. **OpenAI API Outage**: Queue degradation, manual mode
3. **Index Corruption**: Rollback to previous index (symlink system)
4. **High Error Rate**: Automatic escalation to operators

### Operational Risks
1. **Low Approval Rate**: Increase operator training, refine prompts
2. **Slow Response Time**: Scale infrastructure, optimize queries
3. **Poor Quality Scores**: Review knowledge base, improve prompts
4. **Operator Resistance**: Emphasize assistance vs replacement

### Data Risks
1. **Hallucinated Information**: Confidence scoring + citations catch
2. **Outdated Knowledge**: Weekly knowledge base refresh
3. **Privacy Concerns**: No customer data in training logs
4. **Compliance Issues**: Policy-aligned prompts, approval required
