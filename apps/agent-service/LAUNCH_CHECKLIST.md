## Deployment Steps

### Pre-Deployment

1. **Verify Build:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/agent-service
   npm ci
   npm run build
   npm start  # Test locally
   ```

2. **Test Health Check:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8787/health
   # Expected: {"status":"ok","service":"agent-service","version":"1.0.0"}
   ```

3. **Verify Secrets:**
   ```bash
   fly secrets list -a hotdash-agent-service
   ```

### Deployment

1. **Deploy to Fly.io:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/justin/HotDash/hot-dash
   fly deploy -a hotdash-agent-service \
     -c apps/agent-service/fly.toml \
     --dockerfile apps/agent-service/Dockerfile
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment:**
   ```bash
   fly logs -a hotdash-agent-service
   ```

3. **Verify Health:**
   ```bash
   fly status -a hotdash-agent-service
   curl https://hotdash-agent-service.fly.dev/health
   ```

### Post-Deployment

1. **Smoke Tests:**
   - [ ] Health check returns 200
   - [ ] Chatwoot webhook endpoint accessible
   - [ ] Approvals endpoint accessible
   - [ ] Service logs show no errors

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - [ ] Send test webhook from Chatwoot
   - [ ] Verify agent routing
   - [ ] Check approval queue
   - [ ] Verify metrics logging

3. **Monitoring:**
   - [ ] Set up alerts for errors
   - [ ] Monitor response times
   - [ ] Track handoff accuracy
   - [ ] Monitor fallback rate

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ All 5 agents operational (Triage, Order Support, Shipping Support, Product Q&A, Technical Support)
- ✅ 26 intents classified correctly
- ✅ Confidence scoring working
- ✅ Handoff decisions accurate
- ✅ Fallback logic triggers appropriately
- ✅ HITL approval gates functional
- ✅ Metrics tracking operational

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Health check response < 100ms
- [ ] Handoff decision latency < 100ms
- [ ] Webhook processing < 3s
- [ ] Memory usage < 400MB
- [ ] CPU usage < 80%

### Quality Requirements

- [ ] Handoff accuracy ≥ 90% (after 1 week)
- [ ] Average confidence ≥ 0.80
- [ ] Fallback rate ≤ 10%
- [ ] Human review resolution ≤ 15 minutes
- [ ] Zero critical errors in first 24 hours

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   ```bash
   fly releases -a hotdash-agent-service
   fly releases rollback <version> -a hotdash-agent-service
   ```

2. **Verify Rollback:**
   ```bash
   fly status -a hotdash-agent-service
   curl https://hotdash-agent-service.fly.dev/health
   ```

3. **Investigate:**
   - Review logs: `fly logs -a hotdash-agent-service`
   - Check metrics
   - Identify root cause

4. **Fix and Redeploy:**
   - Fix issues in code
   - Test locally
   - Redeploy with fixes

## Post-Launch Monitoring (First 7 Days)

### Daily Checks

- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Check handoff accuracy metrics
- [ ] Monitor fallback rate
- [ ] Review human feedback on drafts
- [ ] Check response times

### Weekly Review

- [ ] Analyze handoff accuracy trends
- [ ] Review confidence score distribution
- [ ] Evaluate fallback reasons
- [ ] Assess agent utilization
- [ ] Gather stakeholder feedback

## Known Limitations

1. **Metrics Storage:** Currently using console.log; TODO: Implement database logging
2. **Slack Notifications:** Webhook URL needs to be configured
3. **Testing:** Automated tests need to be implemented by QA
4. **Monitoring:** Advanced monitoring dashboard not yet implemented

## Next Steps After Launch

1. Implement database logging for metrics
2. Create monitoring dashboard
3. Add automated tests
4. Tune confidence thresholds based on real data
5. Expand intent taxonomy based on usage patterns
6. Optimize agent instructions based on feedback
