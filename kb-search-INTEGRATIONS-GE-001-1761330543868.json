      "answer": "Common issues and solutions when implementing the Wire Accounts Sub-Agent to the Agent SDK include:\n1. **Authorization Issues**: Ensure that the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is correctly configured. The Accounts Sub-Agent requires write access for operations like refunds and order lookups. Verify that the roles and scopes are properly assigned to avoid permission errors [Source 3].\n2. **Data Handling**: The Accounts Sub-Agent must handle Personally Identifiable Information (PII) correctly. Use the PII Broker to enforce redaction of sensitive data in responses to operators. Ensure that the PII Card is utilized for full details, which are only accessible to operators [Source 5].\n3. **Integration with APIs**: Ensure that the integration with Shopify Admin GraphQL is functioning correctly. This includes validating GraphQL queries and ensuring that the sub-agent can execute them without errors. Use the MCP tools for guidance on API usage [Source 8].\n4. **HITL Approval Process**: For write operations, ensure that the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval process is correctly implemented. This means that any actions requiring approval (like refunds) must be routed through the operator for review before execution [Source 3].\n5. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to capture any issues that arise during the execution of requests. This will help in diagnosing problems quickly and ensuring accountability [Source 4].\n6. **Testing and Validation**: Conduct thorough testing of the Accounts Sub-Agent functionality, including unit tests and integration tests, to ensure that all features work as expected before deployment [Source 4].\nIf there are specific issues not covered here, further details would be needed to provide targeted solutions.",
