### 6. Fly.io Deployment ✅
**App**: hotdash-analytics-mcp
**URL**: https://hotdash-analytics-mcp.fly.dev/mcp
**Status**: Running, health checks passing

**Secrets Configured**:
- `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`: hotrodan-seo-reports
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`: Base64-encoded service account JSON
- `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`: Generated (see retrieval command below)

### 7. Supporting Files ✅

- `fly-apps/analytics-mcp/deploy.sh`: Automated deployment script
- `fly-apps/analytics-mcp/.gitignore`: Prevents credential commits

## Pending Tasks

### 1. Configure Local MCP Client ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Configuration added to `.mcp.json`

**Configuration Added**:
```json
{
  "google-analytics": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://hotdash-analytics-mcp.fly.dev/mcp",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer 0c03d0464df8bfca7aff619e5f16a0976ad01ead16af8da26dc42a0eb5448af2"
    }
  }
}
```

**New MCP_AUTH_TOKEN Generated**: `0c03d0464df8bfca7aff619e5f16a0976ad01ead16af8da26dc42a0eb5448af2`

### 2. Health Check Verification ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Health endpoint responding correctly

```bash
curl https://hotdash-analytics-mcp.fly.dev/health
# Returns: OK
```

The server successfully auto-starts from stopped state when requests arrive (took ~10 seconds on first request).

### 3. Verify Google Analytics Access ⏳
**Action Required**: Ensure service account has "Viewer" role in Google Analytics

**Steps**:
1. Go to Google Analytics Admin console
2. Navigate to Property > Property Settings > Property Access Management
3. Add service account: `analytics-mcp-fly@hotrodan-seo-reports.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Grant "Viewer" role

### 4. Test MCP Connection ⏳ READY FOR TESTING
**Action Required**: Test queries through the MCP client after GA access is configured

**Example Test Queries**:
- List available Google Analytics properties
- Get property metadata
- Run simple analytics queries

**Note**: The MCP endpoint is deployed and accessible. Initial curl tests showed the server starts correctly. Full MCP protocol testing should be done through the MCP client once Google Analytics access is configured.

## Key Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. Client sends request to `https://hotdash-analytics-mcp.fly.dev/mcp` with Bearer token
2. mcp-http-wrapper.py verifies token
3. Wrapper decodes base64 GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON
4. Writes credentials to temporary file
5. Sets GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env var
6. Starts analytics-mcp subprocess on-demand
7. Forwards request/response via HTTP/SSE

### Cost Optimization
- Fly.io configured with `auto_stop_machines = "stop"`
- `auto_start_machines = true`
- `min_machines_running = 0`
- Expected cost: $0-2/month (only runs when in use)

### Health Check Strategy
Health check endpoint (`/health`) returns "OK" if HTTP server is responsive. The analytics-mcp subprocess starts on-demand when requests arrive, so subprocess state is not part of health check.

## Troubleshooting

### Check Server Status
```bash
~/.fly/bin/flyctl status --app hotdash-analytics-mcp
```

### View Logs
```bash
~/.fly/bin/flyctl logs --app hotdash-analytics-mcp
```

### Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://hotdash-analytics-mcp.fly.dev/health
# Should return: OK
```

### Test MCP Endpoint (with auth)
```bash
curl -X POST https://hotdash-analytics-mcp.fly.dev/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}}}'
```

## Errors Encountered and Fixed

### Error 1: Google Credentials Not Accessible
**Symptom**: Health check failing, 503 errors
**Cause**: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON was base64-encoded in environment, but Google auth library expected file path
**Fix**: Modified mcp-http-wrapper.py to decode base64 and write to temp file in `_setup_credentials()` method

### Error 2: Health Check Logic Too Strict
**Symptom**: Health check failing despite server running
**Cause**: Health check verified MCP subprocess was running, but subprocess starts on-demand
**Fix**: Simplified health check to only verify HTTP server responsiveness

## Next Steps (Manual User Action Required)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Grant Service Account Access to Google Analytics

Before the MCP server can access Google Analytics data, you MUST grant the service account access:

1. **Go to Google Analytics Admin Console**
   - Navigate to: https://analytics.google.com/
   - Select your property (likely hotrodan.com or related property)

2. **Add Service Account**
   - Go to: Property Settings → Property Access Management
   - Click "Add Users"
   - Add email: `analytics-mcp-fly@hotrodan-seo-reports.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Grant role: **Viewer** (read-only access)
   - Save

3. **Test the Connection**
   - Restart your MCP client (Cursor/Claude Desktop)
   - Try querying Google Analytics data through the google-analytics MCP server
   - Available tools should include:
     - List GA properties
     - Get property metadata
     - Run analytics queries
     - Get reports

### If Testing Fails

Check the Fly logs for errors:
```bash
~/.fly/bin/flyctl logs --app hotdash-analytics-mcp --no-tail
```

Common issues:
- Service account doesn't have GA access (403 errors)
- Wrong property ID
- Authentication issues

**Configuration Complete**: ✅ Server deployed, client configured, health checks passing
**Manual Action Required**: ⏳ Grant GA access to service account
**Estimated Time for Manual Step**: 5 minutes
