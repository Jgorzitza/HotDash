# Social Teaser Motion Notes

**Use Case:** 15-second teasers for Meta Reels, Instagram Stories, LinkedIn native video, and X promoted clips.

## Storyboard

1. **0-3s — Problem Statement**
   - Text overlay: "Launch week chaos?" (3 words animated)
   - Visual: Rapid montage of Shopify tabs, spreadsheets, support inbox.
   - Audio cue: Quick stutter/glitch to imply overload.

2. **3-7s — Solution Reveal**
   - Transition: UI swipe into HotDash control center.
   - Highlight: Inventory alert card and CX approval slider popping into view.
   - Text overlay: "HotDash keeps ops in control."

3. **7-12s — Value Proof**
   - Sequence of checkmarks next to "Inventory", "CX", "Growth" sections.
   - Metric callouts animating up: "-40% manual ops", "+25% launch velocity".

4. **12-15s — CTA**
   - Logo lockup with CTA button "Start Free Trial".
   - Subtext: "Human-reviewed AI for Shopify teams."
   - End frame holds for 2 seconds to enable click-through.

## Production Notes

- Format: 1080x1920 vertical, safe zones for story UI.
- Audio: Upbeat launch track (120 BPM) with soft synths; ensure license compliance.
- Captions: Burned-in for silent autoplay; use contrast ratio ≥4.5:1.
- Deliverables: MP4 (H.264), MOV (ProRes), plus layered project file.

## Approval Workflow

- Upload storyboard + rough cut to `/admin/marketing/approvals` for CEO review.
- Capture QA checklist (color contrast, caption accuracy) before final render.

**Status:** Waiting on motion design resources; target final cut by Day -5.
