# Agent Workflow: Database-Driven Tasks & Feedback

**CRITICAL (2025-10-22): Both task assignments AND feedback are now database-driven.**

## Task Assignments (Manager Assigns, Agents QUERY)
- **Method**: Database `TaskAssignment` table via `assignTask()` / `getMyTasks()`
- **Manager**: Assigns tasks via database (instant, 10+ times/day, no git commits)
- **Agents**: Query via `getMyTasks(agent)` or `scripts/agent/get-my-tasks.ts`
- **Benefits**: Instant visibility, automatic unblocking when dependencies clear, zero idle time
- **Markdown direction files**: ARCHIVED (too slow for hourly updates)

## KB Integration (MANDATORY - Effective 2025-10-25)

**CRITICAL**: Before starting ANY task, search KB for existing solutions to prevent redoing work.

### KB Search Process (MANDATORY)

1. **Search KB before starting task**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/agent/kb-search.ts <TASK-ID> "<TASK-TITLE>" <your-agent>
   ```

2. **Review KB results**:
   - Check for existing solutions or similar implementations
   - Look for common issues and their solutions
   - Identify security considerations
   - Note integration points with other systems

3. **Log KB search results**:
   ```typescript
   await logDecision({
     scope: 'build',
     actor: '<your-agent>',
     action: 'kb_search_completed',
     rationale: 'KB search completed before starting task',
     taskId: '<TASK-ID>',
     payload: {
       searchResults: 'Found existing solutions',
       recommendations: ['Review security considerations', 'Check integration points'],
       sources: ['docs/example.md', 'docs/patterns.md']
     }
   });
   ```

### Why KB Search Matters

- **Prevents Redoing Work**: Find existing solutions before implementing
- **Context Recovery**: Access lost knowledge from documentation
- **Issue Prevention**: Identify common problems and their solutions
- **Security Awareness**: Review security considerations before implementation
- **Integration Planning**: Understand system connections before building

### Enforcement

- **KB search is MANDATORY** before task execution
- **No exceptions** - all agents must search KB before starting work
- **Manager audits** KB search compliance
- **Violations result in task reassignment**

## Feedback (Agents Report Progress, Manager QUERIES)
- **ONLY Method**: Database via `logDecision()` (MANDATORY - no markdown backup)
- **Manager Access**: Query scripts (instant filtered results, real-time visibility)
- **Frequency**: 
  - IMMEDIATE on task completion/blocked/unblocked (don't wait!)
  - Every 2 hours if still in progress on same task
  - Enables real-time coordination (manager sees blockers cleared instantly)

## Required Feedback Format (Database)

**Use `logDecision()` from `~/services/decisions.server`**:

```typescript
import { logDecision } from '~/services/decisions.server';

await logDecision({
  scope: 'build',
  actor: 'engineer',                    // Your agent name
  taskId: 'ENG-029',                    // Task from direction file
  status: 'in_progress',                // pending | in_progress | completed | blocked | cancelled
  progressPct: 75,                      // 0-100 percentage
  action: 'task_progress',              // What happened
  rationale: 'Implementing PII Card component, tests passing',
  evidenceUrl: 'artifacts/engineer/2025-10-22/eng-029.md',
  durationActual: 3.0,                  // Hours spent (optional)
  nextAction: 'Writing integration tests'  // What's next (optional)
});
```

**When Blocked** (include blocker context in payload):
```typescript
await logDecision({
  scope: 'build',
  actor: 'integrations',
  taskId: 'INTEGRATIONS-013',
  status: 'blocked',                    // IMPORTANT: Use 'blocked' status
  progressPct: 40,
  blockerDetails: 'Waiting for DATA-017 vendor_master table migration',
  blockedBy: 'DATA-017',                // What's blocking (task ID or resource)
  action: 'task_blocked',
  rationale: 'Cannot proceed without vendor_master table',
  evidenceUrl: 'feedback/integrations/2025-10-22.md',
  payload: {
    blockerType: 'dependency',
    attemptedSolutions: ['Checked if could mock table - too complex'],
    impact: 'Blocks INTEGRATIONS-014 and INTEGRATIONS-015',
    urgency: 'high'
  }
});
```

**When Asking Manager a Question**:
```typescript
await logDecision({
  scope: 'build',
  actor: 'engineer',
  taskId: 'ENG-029',
  status: 'blocked',
  blockerDetails: 'Need manager decision on technical approach',
  blockedBy: 'manager-decision',
  action: 'awaiting_decision',
  rationale: 'Should we use Polaris Card or custom component?',
  payload: {
    questionType: 'architectural',
    options: ['Polaris Card', 'Custom Component'],
    tradeoffs: 'Polaris: faster, Custom: more flexible',
    recommendation: 'Polaris Card'
  }
});
```

## MUST DO
1. ✅ **Search KB before starting ANY task**: `npx tsx scripts/agent/kb-search.ts <TASK-ID> "<TASK-TITLE>" <your-agent>`
2. ✅ Query tasks from database: `getMyTasks(agent)` or `scripts/agent/get-my-tasks.ts`
3. ✅ Start tasks via: `scripts/agent/start-task.ts <TASK-ID>` (logs automatically)
4. ✅ Log progress via `logDecision()` - IMMEDIATE on status changes, every 2h if in-progress
5. ✅ Include `taskId`, `status`, `progressPct` in EVERY log
6. ✅ Use `status: 'blocked'` + `blockerDetails` when blocked, then query next available task
7. ✅ Complete tasks via: `scripts/agent/complete-task.ts <TASK-ID> "context notes"`
8. ✅ Include rich metadata in `payload` (commits, files, tests, MCP evidence)
9. ✅ Self-grade at shutdown (payload.selfGrade + payload.retrospective)

## MUST NOT
1. ❌ **Start tasks without KB search** (MANDATORY - search KB before ANY task execution)
2. ❌ Read markdown direction files (archived - use database queries)
3. ❌ Self-assign tasks (all tasks from Manager via `assignTask()`)
4. ❌ Skip `logDecision()` calls (database logging MANDATORY)
5. ❌ Use vague status values (use the 5 standard statuses only)
6. ❌ Forget `taskId` field (required for manager queries)
7. ❌ Wait to report status changes (IMMEDIATE logging on complete/blocked/unblocked)

## Manager Queries (How Manager Sees Your Progress)

Manager uses these scripts to view your work (< 1 second):

```bash
# See all blocked tasks
scripts/manager/query-blocked-tasks.ts

# See your current status
scripts/manager/query-agent-status.ts  

# See completed work today
scripts/manager/query-completed-today.ts
```

**This is why structured logging is CRITICAL** - Manager can instantly see:
- Who's blocked and on what
- Current progress across all agents
- What got done today

## Evidence Examples

**✅ GOOD `evidenceUrl` values**:
- `artifacts/engineer/2025-10-22/eng-029-pii-card.md`
- `feedback/data/2025-10-22.md`
- `supabase/migrations/20251022000001_enhance_decision_log.sql`

**✅ GOOD `rationale` values**:
- "Implemented PII Card component with redaction logic, 15/15 tests passing"
- "Created vendor_master migration with RLS policies, ready for review"
- "Fixed React Router 7 violations across 3 files (json → Response.json)"

**❌ BAD**:
- Empty or missing `taskId`
- Status "working" (use 'in_progress')
- No evidence URL

**See**: `scripts/manager/README.md` for query examples

## NEW: Growth Engine Evidence (Effective 2025-10-21)

**ADDITIVE to feedback markdown - BOTH required now**:

1. **MCP Evidence JSONL** (code changes): `artifacts/<agent>/<date>/mcp/<tool>.jsonl`
2. **Heartbeat NDJSON** (tasks >2h): `artifacts/<agent>/<date>/heartbeat.ndjson`
3. **Dev MCP Ban**: NO Dev MCP imports in `app/` directory
4. **PR Template**: Must include MCP Evidence + Heartbeat + Dev MCP Check sections

**CI Merge Blockers**: PRs fail if evidence missing, heartbeat stale, or Dev MCP in prod

**See**: [.cursor/rules/10-growth-engine-pack.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/10-growth-engine-pack.mdc) for full details
