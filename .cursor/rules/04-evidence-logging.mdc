# Evidence Logging Requirements

**Effective**: 2025-10-20  
**Applies to**: ALL agents including Manager

## Required Evidence Format

### For Tool Usage (MANDATORY)

```md
## HH:MM - Context7: [Library Name]
- Topic: [what I'm implementing/investigating]
- Key Learning: [specific requirement from official docs]
- Applied to: [files changed / decision made]
```

**Real example (2025-10-20 P0 fix)**:
```md
## 17:15 - Context7: Prisma
- Topic: multi-schema support @@schema attribute
- Key Learning: ALL models need @@schema("public") when datasource has schemas array
- Applied to: prisma/schema.prisma (Session, DashboardFact, DecisionLog)
```

### For QA Code Reviews

```md
## Code Review: [Feature/File]
- Verified using: Context7 `/library/path` - topic: [what I checked]
- Official docs say: [key requirement]
- Code matches: ✅ / ❌ [explain if mismatch]
- Recommendation: [pass / request changes]
```

### For Work Progress (Every 2 Hours)

```md
## YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ — {Agent}: [Status]

**Working On**: [Task from direction file]
**Progress**: [Milestone or %]
**Evidence**: [Files, commands (summary only), test results]
**Blockers**: [None or details]
**Next**: [Action]
```

## Evidence Must Include

**File paths**: Always log which files were modified
- ✅ Example: `app/routes/api.analytics.traffic.ts, prisma/schema.prisma`

**Command results** (SUMMARY ONLY, max 10 lines):
- ✅ Example: "fly deploy → completed successfully, release_command passed"
- ❌ NOT: Full 300-line deployment output

**Test results**: Pass/fail counts
- ✅ Example: "186/186 tests passing"

**Tool calls**: Timestamp + what docs were pulled
- ✅ Example: "17:15 - Context7: Prisma - multi-schema support"

**Deployments**: Success/failure + key metrics
- ✅ Example: "Deploy #3 → success, app healthy, GA returning 4,207 sessions"

## What NOT to Log

- ❌ Verbatim npm install output (hundreds of lines)
- ❌ Full command logs without summary
- ❌ Verbose stack traces (use summary + error message)
- ❌ Repetitive metrics (log once per session)

## Feedback File Size Limit

- **Maximum**: 5,000 lines per file
- **If exceeded**: Start new file with continuation note
- **Archive**: Move old content to feedback/archive/

## Enforcement

**Manager checks**:
- Tool usage logged BEFORE code changes
- Evidence is specific (file paths, test counts)
- Evidence is summarized (not verbose)
- Timestamps present for all work
