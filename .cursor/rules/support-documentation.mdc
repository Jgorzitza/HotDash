# Support Documentation Guidelines

## Documentation Categories

### Customer-Facing
- Onboarding guides (installation, first use)
- Troubleshooting guides (common issues, fixes)
- FAQ (product selection, installation, compatibility)
- Video guide scripts (for production team)

### Operator-Facing
- Training materials (product knowledge, procedures)
- Playbooks (escalation, scenarios, scripts)
- Quick start guides (get productive fast)
- Reference materials (specs, part numbers, flowcharts)

### AI Knowledge Base
- Structured articles in `data/support/kb-*.md`
- Optimized for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Format: Tables, lists, clear headings
- Tags: Product categories, issue types

## Content Standards

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify all specifications (torque, pressure, temperatures)
- Include part numbers (Hot Rod AN format: HRA-[type]-[specs])
- Cross-reference with product catalogs
- Test procedures before documenting

### Tone and Style
**For Customers**:
- Friendly and helpful (not overly casual)
- Use "you" and "your" (direct address)
- Break complex procedures into numbered steps
- Include safety warnings where appropriate

**For Operators**:
- Professional and instructional
- Clear action items and decision criteria
- Include escalation paths
- Provide examples and scenarios

### Safety Warnings Format
```markdown
⚠️ CRITICAL: [Safety message]
```

Use for:
- Fuel system work (fire hazard)
- High-pressure systems
- Brake system work
- Any safety-critical procedures

## Hot Rod AN Specific

### Product Knowledge
- AN sizing: Dash number ÷ 16 = ID in inches (AN-6 = 3/8")
- Thread types: AN (UNF straight), NPT (tapered), Metric
- Hose types: PTFE (premium, EFI), Braided (economy, carb), Push-lock (carb only)
- Torque specs: AN-6 = 20-25 ft-lbs or hand-tight + 1/4 turn

### Common Customer Questions
- "What size do I need?" → Based on HP and fuel type
- "PTFE vs braided?" → PTFE for EFI/reliability, braided for budget/carb
- "Can I use Teflon tape?" → Only on NPT (tapered), never on AN (straight)
- "Why is PTFE hard to assemble?" → It's designed tight, requires lube and force

### Part Number Format
`HRA-[category]-[specifications]`
- HRA-HL-PTFE-SS-AN6: PTFE hose, stainless braided, AN-6 size
- HRA-AD-NPT12-AN6: Adapter, 1/2" NPT to AN-6
- HRA-HE-AN6-90: Hose end, AN-6, 90° angle

## Review and Maintenance

### Review Schedule
- Customer guides: Monthly (update for new products/common issues)
- Training materials: Quarterly (update for process changes)
- Technical specs: Annually (verify accuracy)

### Update Process
1. Identify needed update (support tickets, feedback)
2. Research/verify new information
3. Update document with `last_reviewed` date
4. Test procedures if applicable
5. Log update in feedback file
6. Notify team of changes
