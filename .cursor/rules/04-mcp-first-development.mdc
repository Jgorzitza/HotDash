# MCP-First Development (from [docs/NORTH_STAR.md](mdc:docs/NORTH_STAR.md))

## Critical: Agent Training Data is Outdated

**Agent training data contains outdated patterns for**:
- React Router 7 (contains v6/Remix patterns)
- Shopify APIs (2023 or older)

**NEVER trust training data for**:
- React Router 7 loaders/actions
- Shopify GraphQL queries
- Shopify App Bridge patterns

## Required MCP Verification

**Before implementing features**:
1. Search HotDash codebase first (grep)
2. Verify with appropriate MCP tools (conservative token limits: 800-1500)

**MCP Tools Available**:
- **Shopify MCP**: Validate ALL Shopify GraphQL queries
- **Context7 MCP**: Verify React Router 7 patterns
- **GitHub MCP**: Repository operations
- **Supabase MCP**: Database operations
- **Fly MCP**: Deployment operations
- **Google Analytics**: Direct API (not MCP)
- **LlamaIndex RAG MCP**: Universal agent knowledge access

## Workflow
1. Search codebase for existing patterns: `grep -r "pattern" app/`
2. Verify with MCP tools (Shopify for queries, Context7 for RR7)
3. Implement using verified current syntax
4. Never assume training data is current

## Goal
- Use current APIs
- Avoid deprecated patterns
- Maintain type safety
- Stay aligned with 2024 best practices
