# Testing & QA Guidelines

## Testing Structure
- Unit tests: [tests/unit/](mdc:tests/unit/)
- Integration tests: [tests/unit/integration-shopify/](mdc:tests/unit/integration-shopify/)
- Performance tests: [tests/unit/performance/](mdc:tests/unit/performance/)
- Security tests: [tests/unit/security/](mdc:tests/unit/security/)

## Test Framework
Playwright for E2E testing.
Reference: [docs/runbooks/qa_playwright_plan.md](mdc:docs/runbooks/qa_playwright_plan.md)

## QA Validation Process
Reference: [docs/runbooks/qa_validation_process.md](mdc:docs/runbooks/qa_validation_process.md)

## Bug Reporting
Format: [docs/testing/BUG_REPORTING.md](mdc:docs/testing/BUG_REPORTING.md)

## Evidence Requirements
All test results must be logged with:
- Timestamp
- Test commands executed
- Results (pass/fail counts)
- Any failures with details
- File locations

## Testing Standards

### Unit Tests
```typescript
describe('Component', () => {
  it('should handle error states', () => {
    // Test error handling
  });
  
  it('should display help text', () => {
    // Test help text presence
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
Test actual service integrations:
- Shopify GraphQL queries
- Google Analytics API
- Supabase database operations
- Agent SDK tools

## Agent SDK Testing
Reference: [docs/testing/agent-sdk/](mdc:docs/testing/agent-sdk/)
- Chatwoot response templates
