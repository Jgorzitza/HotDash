### 🎮 Ready to Use Right Now!

You can immediately start using these MCP tools in Cursor with natural language prompts:

#### Try These Commands:

**GitHub Operations:**
```
"Create a GitHub issue titled 'Add user profile page' with label 'enhancement'"
"Show me all open pull requests in this repository"
"Search the codebase for uses of the deprecated API"
```

**Context7 Semantic Search:**
```
"Use Context7 to find all React components that use authentication"
"Show me how the payment flow works across the codebase"
"Find all database queries related to user management"
```

**Supabase Database:**
```
"Query Supabase for all users created in the last 7 days"
"Show me the schema for the products table"
"Create a new table called 'reviews' with columns for rating and comment"
```

**Fly.io Deployment:**
```
"Show me the status of all Fly.io deployments"
"Get the last 50 log lines from the agent-service app"
"What's the current resource usage for our apps?"
```

**Shopify E-commerce:**
```
"Validate this Liquid template: {{ product.title | upcase }}"
"Show me all products in the 'Featured' collection"
"Create a new product with title 'Test Widget' and price $19.99"
```

**Google Analytics:**
```
"Get page view statistics for the last 30 days"
"Show me the top 10 traffic sources this week"
"What's the conversion rate for the signup funnel?"
```

### 🔥 Power Combinations

Combine multiple tools for powerful workflows:

**Bug Investigation:**
```
"There's an authentication bug. Use Context7 to find the auth code, 
check Supabase for failed login attempts, view Fly logs for errors, 
and create a GitHub issue with all findings"
```

**Feature Development:**
```
"I want to add product recommendations. Use Context7 to understand 
the current product code, query Supabase for purchase history, 
check Google Analytics for popular products, and create a GitHub 
issue with the implementation plan"
```

**Performance Analysis:**
```
"Use Google Analytics to find slow pages, check Fly resource usage, 
use Context7 to find the responsible code, and create optimization 
issues in GitHub"
```
