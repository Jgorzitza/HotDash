# MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools enable AI assistants to interact with external services and tools.

## ðŸŽ‰ Status: All Systems Operational!

âœ… **All 6 MCP servers are active and ready to use!**

See [ALL_SYSTEMS_GO.md](./ALL_SYSTEMS_GO.md) for ready-to-use examples and workflows.

## Quick Start

1. **Verify Setup**: Run the verification script
   ```bash
   ./mcp/verify-mcp-servers.sh
   ```

2. **Try It Now**: Use a prompt in Cursor
   ```
   "Create a GitHub issue for improving documentation"
   "Query Supabase for users created today"
   "Show me Fly.io deployment status"
   ```

3. **Learn More**: See [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for common use cases
