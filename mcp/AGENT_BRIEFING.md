# Agent Briefing: MCP Directory Protection

**TO:** All AI Agents (Cleanup, Refactoring, Documentation, QA, etc.)  
**FROM:** MCP Setup Process  
**DATE:** 2025-10-15  
**RE:** Critical Infrastructure - MCP Tools Directory

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: READ BEFORE ANY CLEANUP

The `mcp/` directory was created on 2025-10-15 and contains **critical infrastructure documentation** for 6 active MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

**This directory is PROTECTED and must NOT be removed, archived, or modified without explicit approval.**

---

## What You Need to Know

### 1. What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI agents to interact with external tools and services. This codebase uses 6 active MCP servers:

1. **GitHub Official** - Repository management, issues, PRs
2. **Context7** - Semantic code search (running on port 3001)
3. **Supabase** - Database operations
4. **Fly.io** - Deployment management (running on port 8080)
5. **Shopify** - E-commerce operations
6. **Google Analytics** - Analytics and reporting

**All 6 servers are currently OPERATIONAL.**

### 2. Why This Directory Exists

The `mcp/` directory contains comprehensive documentation that enables AI agents to:
- Understand when to use each MCP tool
- Find examples of common workflows
- Troubleshoot MCP server issues
- Verify server status
- Learn best practices

**Without this documentation, AI agents lose critical capabilities.**

### 3. Protection Status

‚úÖ **CI Enforcement Active:**
- `scripts/policy/check-docs.mjs` - Line 16: `/^mcp\/.+\.md$/`
- `Dangerfile.js` - Line 18: `/^mcp\/.+\.md$/`

‚úÖ **Documented in Governance:**
- `docs/RULES.md` - Line 21: `mcp/**` in allow-list
- `docs/NORTH_STAR.md` - Lines 9, 40-44: MCP architecture
- `docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md` - Lines 35-38: MCP guardrails
- `README.md` - Lines 74-104: MCP tools section

‚úÖ **Verification Available:**
```bash
./mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh  # Quick test - all 6 servers should be active
```

---

## For Cleanup Agents

### DO NOT:
- ‚ùå Delete any files in `mcp/` directory
- ‚ùå Move files to `docs/_archive/`
- ‚ùå Mark as "stale" or "cleanup candidate"
- ‚ùå Suggest removal in cleanup reports
- ‚ùå Archive or relocate the directory

### INSTEAD:
- ‚úÖ Skip the `mcp/` directory entirely
- ‚úÖ Report it as "PROTECTED INFRASTRUCTURE - SKIPPED"
- ‚úÖ Verify servers are operational: `./mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh`

### Sample Report Entry:
```markdown
### MCP Directory (`mcp/`)
**Status:** PROTECTED INFRASTRUCTURE - SKIPPED
**Reason:** Active MCP tools documentation (6 servers operational)
**CI Protection:** Verified in check-docs.mjs, Dangerfile.js, RULES.md
**Verification:** Ran ./mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh - All 6 servers active
**Action:** None - directory preserved as critical infrastructure
```

---

## For Documentation Agents

### You MAY:
- ‚úÖ Read and reference MCP documentation
- ‚úÖ Add new documentation files (they're in the allow-list)
- ‚úÖ Fix typos or broken links
- ‚úÖ Update server status information
- ‚úÖ Add usage examples or patterns

### You MUST:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify changes don't break CI policy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test scripts after modifications
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Maintain protection notices
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep references in core docs updated

---

## For QA/Testing Agents

### Verification Steps:
```bash
# 1. Quick test (recommended)
./mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh

# 2. Comprehensive verification
./mcp/verify-mcp-servers.sh

# 3. Check CI policy
node scripts/policy/check-docs.mjs
```

**Expected Results:**
- All 6 MCP servers show as "Ready to use"
- CI policy check passes
- No violations reported

---

## For Refactoring Agents

### Before Any Changes:
1. ‚úÖ Check if `mcp/` is affected
2. ‚úÖ Verify it's in CI allow-list (`docs/RULES.md`)
3. ‚úÖ Confirm servers are operational
4. ‚úÖ Review protection notices

### If Refactoring Affects MCP:
- Consult `mcp/PROTECTION_NOTICE.md`
- Verify changes with `./mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh`
- Update documentation if needed
- Maintain CI protection

---

## Emergency Recovery

If files are accidentally removed:

```bash
# Restore from git history
git checkout HEAD -- mcp/

# Verify restoration
./mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh

# Report incident in feedback log
```
