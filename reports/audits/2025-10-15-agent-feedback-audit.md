## Detailed Findings

### Ads Agent — ⚠️ Partial
- **Verified:** `app/lib/ads/tracking.ts:1`, `app/routes/ads.dashboard.tsx:1`, `app/lib/ads/creative-analysis.ts:1`, `app/lib/ads/ab-tests.ts:1`, `app/lib/ads/anomaly-detection.ts:1`, `app/lib/ads/forecast.ts:1`.
- **Missing vs report:** `app/lib/ads/roas.ts` (not present), `app/services/ads/budget-optimizer.ts` (not present), `app/lib/ads/audience-insights.ts` (not present), `app/services/ads/recommendations.ts` (not present), `app/components/dashboard/RevenueTile.tsx` (not present), `app/components/dashboard/index.ts` (not present).
- **Impact:** Core ROAS, budget optimization, audience insights, and HITL recommendation services claimed complete but absent; dashboard tile inventory overstated. Recommend staging these items as TODO and updating feedback log.

### Analytics Agent — ✅ Pass
- **Verified deliverables:** `app/lib/analytics/ga4.ts:1`, `app/routes/analytics.traffic.tsx:1`, `app/routes/analytics.funnels.tsx:1`, `app/routes/analytics.landing-pages.tsx:1`, `app/routes/api.analytics.revenue.ts:1`, `docs/integrations/ga4-analytics-api.md:1`, `scripts/test-all-analytics.mjs:1`.
- **Tests present:** `tests/integration/api-analytics.spec.ts:1`, `tests/unit/ga.direct.spec.ts:1`.
- **Outcome:** Matches feedback narrative; traffic dashboards, GA4 helpers, and docs in repository.

### AI-Customer Agent — ⚠️ Partial
- **Verified:** HITL tooling and shared utilities exist (`app/components/grading/GradingInterface.tsx:1`, `app/agents/tools/*.ts`, `app/agents/context/index.ts:1`, `app/agents/learning/index.ts:1`, `tests/agents/integration.test.ts:1`, `tests/security/red-team.test.ts:1`).
- **Missing vs report:** `app/agents/sdk/index.ts`, `app/agents/customer/index.ts`, `app/agents/ceo/index.ts`, `app/agents/examples/customer-support-example.ts`, `app/agents/examples/ceo-assistant-example.ts` (none present). These files represent core agents/sdk entry points touted as complete.
- **Impact:** Feedback overstates completion of SDK bootstrap and agent definitions; current tree has utilities but no exposed agent modules. Needs remediation or log correction.

### AI-Knowledge Agent — ✅ Pass
- **Schema & migrations:** `supabase/migrations/20251015_kb_schema.sql:1`, `supabase/migrations/20251015_kb_seed_data.sql:1`.
- **Services & libs:** `app/services/knowledge/learning.ts:1`, `app/lib/knowledge/quality.ts:1`, `app/lib/knowledge/search.ts:1`, `app/lib/knowledge/graph.ts:1`.
- **Tests & fixtures:** `tests/unit/knowledge/learning.spec.ts:1`, `tests/integration/knowledge/kb-workflow.spec.ts:1`, `tests/fixtures/kb-articles.json:1`.
- **Outcome:** All referenced artifacts exist; schema aligns with documentation.

### Content Agent — ✅ Pass
- **Verified:** `app/services/content/post-drafter.ts:1`, `app/services/content/engagement-analyzer.ts:1`, `app/services/content/hashtags.ts:1`, `app/services/content/competitors.ts:1`, `app/services/content/recommendations.ts:1`, `app/services/content/hitl-posting.ts:1`, `app/routes/content.calendar.tsx:1`, `app/lib/content/engagement.ts:1`, `app/lib/content/timing.ts:1`.
- **Tests:** `tests/unit/components/dashboard/tiles.spec.tsx:1` (tile coverage).
- **Outcome:** Matches declared work; HITL workflow scaffolding implemented.

### Data Agent — ❌ Fail
- **Missing artifacts:** Claimed docs `docs/specs/approvals_schema.md` and `docs/specs/audit_schema.md` not present. No migrations named `supabase/migrations/20251015_approvals_workflow.sql` or `..._audit_logs.sql`; only legacy `20251011150400_agent_approvals.sql` and other 20251015 migrations are in repo.
- **Existing work:** Migrations such as `supabase/migrations/20251015_dashboard_rpc_functions.sql:1`, `supabase/migrations/20251015_inventory_picker_payouts.sql:1`, `supabase/migrations/20251015_growth_metrics_daily.sql:1`, and doc `docs/specs/inventory_cx_growth_schemas.md:1`.
- **Impact:** Feedback significantly overstates schema coverage (approvals/audit docs and migrations not delivered). Manager should flag for corrective action.

### DevOps Agent — ✅ Pass
- **Verified:** Workflows `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml:1`, `.github/workflows/rollback-production.yml:1`, `.github/workflows/health-check.yml:1`; metrics implementation `app/metrics/prometheus.server.ts:1`; logging `app/lib/logger.ts:1`; backup scripts `scripts/backup/backup-database.sh:1`, `scripts/backup/restore-database.sh:1`; runbooks `docs/runbooks/production_deployment.md:1`, `docs/runbooks/common_incidents.md:1`.
- **Outcome:** Feedback accurate.

### Engineer Agent — ❌ Fail
- **Missing vs report:** `app/components/approvals/ApprovalsDrawer.tsx`, `app/components/approvals/index.ts`, `app/fixtures/approvals.ts`, `app/routes/dashboard.tsx`, `app/services/agent-service.ts`, `tests/unit/components/approvals/ApprovalsDrawer.spec.tsx`, `tests/e2e/approvals.e2e.spec.ts` — none exist. Dashboard tiles also narrower than claimed (`app/components/dashboard` lacks `RevenueTile.tsx`).
- **Existing partials:** `app/components/dashboard/AOVTile.tsx:1`, `app/components/dashboard/ReturnsTile.tsx:1`, `app/components/dashboard/SEOTile.tsx:1`, `app/components/dashboard/CXTile.tsx:1`, `tests/unit/components/dashboard/tiles.spec.tsx:1`.
- **Impact:** Critical discrepancy; approvals drawer, dashboard shell, and associated tests were not implemented despite report. Needs immediate correction.

### Integrations Agent — ⚠️ Partial
- **Verified:** `app/lib/analytics/client.ts:1`, `app/lib/chatwoot/client.ts:1`, `app/lib/cache/lru.ts:1`, `app/lib/pagination.ts:1`, `app/lib/circuit-breaker.ts:1`, `app/lib/monitoring/sla.ts:1`, `app/routes/api/health/index.ts:1`, `app/routes/webhooks/chatwoot.conversation.update.ts:1`, `tests/mocks/chatwoot-server.ts:1`, `docs/api-contracts/README.md:1`.
- **Missing vs report:** `app/lib/supabase/client.ts`, `app/lib/errors.ts`, `app/middleware/audit.ts`, `app/middleware/rate-limit.ts`, `tests/integration/api/clients.test.ts` — none found.
- **Impact:** Key middleware/error modules absent. Feedback should be revised; prioritize building missing clients/middleware or updating status.

### Inventory Agent — ⚠️ Partial
- **Verified:** `app/services/inventory/rop.ts:1`, `app/services/inventory/po-generator.ts:1`, `app/services/inventory/kits.ts:1`, `app/services/inventory/payouts.ts:1`, `app/services/inventory/alerts.ts:1`, `app/services/inventory/suggestions.ts:1`, `tests/unit/inventory.rop.spec.ts:1`, `tests/unit/inventory.po-generator.spec.ts:1`, `supabase/migrations/20251015_inventory_picker_payouts.sql:1`.
- **Documentation mismatch:** Declared `docs/specs/inventory_data_model.md` doesn’t exist; closest artifact is `docs/specs/inventory_spec.md:1`. Shopify metafields doc `docs/integrations/shopify_inventory_metafields.md` absent.
- **Impact:** Technical implementation largely present; update feedback references to actual filenames and add missing docs if needed.

### Product Agent — ⚠️ Partial
- **Verified specs:** `docs/specs/feature_prioritization.md:1`, `docs/specs/iteration_plan.md:1`, `docs/specs/rollback_criteria.md:1`, `docs/specs/monitoring_plan.md:1`, `docs/specs/stakeholder_comms.md:1`, `docs/specs/product_operations_specs.md:1`, `docs/specs/acceptance_criteria_comprehensive.md:1`, `docs/specs/user_training.md:1`.
- **Missing vs report:** `docs/specs/dashboard_launch_readiness.md` not present.
- **Impact:** Majority of documents exist, but launch readiness deliverable absent; feedback should note this gap.

### QA Agent — ✅ Pass
- **Verified:** `tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts:1`, `tests/integration/api-routes.spec.ts:1`, `tests/performance/load-testing.spec.ts:1`, `tests/security/security.spec.ts:1`, plus existing accessibility suite `tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts:1`.
- **Outcome:** Matches reported coverage.

### SEO Agent — ✅ Pass
- **Verified:** `app/lib/seo/rankings.ts:1`, `tests/unit/seo.rankings.spec.ts:1`, `app/lib/seo/anomalies.ts:1`, `app/lib/seo/web-vitals.ts:1`, `tests/unit/seo.web-vitals.spec.ts:1`.
- **Outcome:** Deliverables align with report.

### Support Agent — ⚠️ Partial
- **Verified:** `scripts/rag/build-index.ts:1`, `app/services/support/kb-ingest.ts:1`, `app/services/support/triage.ts:1`, `app/services/support/sla-monitor.ts:1`, `app/lib/support/priority-queue.ts:1`, `app/services/support/chatwoot-webhook.ts:1`.
- **Issue:** `scripts/rag/build-index.ts` deletes `packages/memory/indexes/operator_knowledge` before confirming embeddings configuration, leaving index removed when OpenAI key unavailable (see removal commands around line 60).
- **Impact:** Functional gap despite implementation; need to protect existing index or provide fallback and update feedback to flag the blocker.

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate Follow-up (High Priority):** Engineer, Ads, Data, Integrations, AI-Customer, Product (launch doc), Inventory (docs) — adjust feedback logs and plan remediation for missing deliverables.
2. **Process Correction:** Reinforce requirement to log actual filenames and evidence. Suggest adding automated validation against declared file paths before feedback submission.
3. **Support Agent:** Patch `scripts/rag/build-index.ts` to skip deletion unless embeddings configured, or document alternative workflow.
4. **Manager Review:** Share this audit with each agent lead; require updated feedback files with accurate status and next steps.

## Manager Follow-Up & Required Actions

Justin, we uncovered widespread gaps because a tranche of files was removed without verifying agent deliverables first. That single clean-up pass has now invalidated multiple status reports. I need you to treat this as a priority fix and avoid repeating the mistake—teams lost evidence, and trust took a hit.

### High-Priority Next Steps
1. **Restore or Rebuild Missing Assets:** The files listed below must be reinstated or rewritten before the next sprint checkpoint. Assign owners, set dates, and confirm once each artifact is back in place or explicitly descoped.
2. **Correct Feedback Logs:** Have each affected agent update their `feedback/*/2025-10-15*.md` entry to reflect actual status, remediation ownership, and timelines.
3. **Guard Against Future Loss:** Before any future repo purge, run a dependency check (even a simple `rg` of paths referenced in feedback) and coordinate with agents so evidence isn’t discarded again.
4. **Support Script Fix:** Patch `scripts/rag/build-index.ts` to skip deleting `packages/memory/indexes/operator_knowledge` unless embeddings are configured, then rebuild the index once credentials are in place.

### Files Currently Missing (Must Restore)
- **Ads:** `app/lib/ads/roas.ts`, `app/services/ads/budget-optimizer.ts`, `app/lib/ads/audience-insights.ts`, `app/services/ads/recommendations.ts`, `app/components/dashboard/RevenueTile.tsx`, `app/components/dashboard/index.ts`
- **Engineer:** `app/components/approvals/ApprovalsDrawer.tsx`, `app/components/approvals/index.ts`, `app/fixtures/approvals.ts`, `app/routes/dashboard.tsx`, `app/services/agent-service.ts`, `tests/unit/components/approvals/ApprovalsDrawer.spec.tsx`, `tests/e2e/approvals.e2e.spec.ts`
- **AI-Customer:** `app/agents/sdk/index.ts`, `app/agents/customer/index.ts`, `app/agents/ceo/index.ts`, `app/agents/examples/customer-support-example.ts`, `app/agents/examples/ceo-assistant-example.ts`
- **Data:** `docs/specs/approvals_schema.md`, `docs/specs/audit_schema.md`, `supabase/migrations/20251015_approvals_workflow.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20251015_approvals_workflow.rollback.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20251015_audit_logs.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20251015_audit_logs.rollback.sql`
- **Integrations:** `app/lib/supabase/client.ts`, `app/lib/errors.ts`, `app/middleware/audit.ts`, `app/middleware/rate-limit.ts`, `tests/integration/api/clients.test.ts`
- **Inventory:** `docs/specs/inventory_data_model.md`, `docs/integrations/shopify_inventory_metafields.md`
- **Product:** `docs/specs/dashboard_launch_readiness.md`

Failure to replace these artifacts leaves the project without the promised functionality, documentation, or tests. Let’s get accountability back on track. ***
