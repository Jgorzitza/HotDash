# Manager Performance Audit — 2025-10-15

**Subject:** Daily execution review for Manager agent (Justin)  
**Artifacts referenced:** `docs/directions/manager.md`, manager feedback logs in `feedback/manager/`, repository state as of 2025-10-15.

---

## Quick Take
- **Strengths:** Rapidly realigned every agent to the NORTH_STAR, documented blockers with clear remediation steps, and surfaced the approvals-route build failure that was masking the analytics deployment (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15-approvals-route-investigation.md`). Daily ritual adherence is evident in the startup checklist and drift guard sweep (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15.md`).
- **Critical Miss:** The root-cause of today’s pain—the broad file deletion without dependency checks—landed squarely on the manager role. That single action removed essential assets for seven agents, stalling otherwise well-aligned direction files (§Alignment Audit).
- **Guardrails & Enforcement:** Ran policy checks and flagged a Gitleaks incident (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15.md`), but follow-through to sanitize archives isn’t reflected in the repo yet. GitHub push protection verification and feedback cadence CI remain open loops.
- **Momentum Risk:** GitHub Issues remain absent (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15.md` “Issues: 0 open”), leaving agents without traceable molecules despite thorough direction docs. Continuous improvement requires converting those direction items into actionable, trackable work.

## Highlight Reel — What Went Well

1. **North Star Realignment:** The “Clean Realignment” note captures a decisive pivot back to the live-app roadmap, mapping P0/P1/P2 priorities across all 15 agents (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15-clean-realign.md`). Direction files now reflect those priorities (e.g., `docs/directions/engineer.md:180`, `docs/directions/inventory.md:24`), which enabled today’s alignment audit to even exist.
2. **Guardrail Awareness:** Startup ritual logged every gate—including CI, Gitleaks, Docs policy, MCP health—and explicitly called a stop-the-line on secrets in archives (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15.md`). That vigilance is the kind of proactive governance the North Star demands.
3. **Analytics Blocker Diagnosis:** The approvals route failure analysis was thorough, pinpointed the path-alias misconfiguration, and offered graded remediation options (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15-approvals-route-investigation.md`). That clarity keeps the Analytics win from getting buried.

Keep doing these. They demonstrate the leadership discipline the project needs.

## Where Execution Slipped

1. **Unvetted File Purge (Major Regressor)**
   - Deleting large swaths of the repo without checking downstream dependencies broke deliverables for Ads, Engineer, AI-Customer, Integrations, Data, Inventory, and Product agents. The alignment audit now lists 18 missing assets wholly attributable to that event (`reports/audits/2025-10-15-agent-task-alignment.md`).
   - Impact: Agents’ tasks are blocked, approval UI unusable, analytics deployment stalled. This is the single largest productivity hit of the day.
   - Expectation: Manager role must treat repo hygiene with the same HITL caution we demand from agents. Always run a dependency sweep (even a quick `rg` for file references) before destructive ops.

2. **Guardrail Follow-Through**
   - While the Gitleaks failure was flagged, there’s no evidence of a sanitization commit or secrets posture update. Until the archives are cleaned, the “stop-the-line” trigger remains active.
   - Push protection status is still “assumed on” (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15.md`). Verification should be explicit (GitHub UI screenshot or CLI output) when we’re in launch prep.
   - Feedback Cadence CI has been red for two runs with no remediation plan noted.

3. **Task Traceability Gaps**
   - No GitHub Issues exist for the molecules listed in direction files (`feedback/manager/2025-10-15.md`, “Issues: 0”). Direction docs now carry detailed objectives, but without Issues and Allowed-path annotations, we lose auditability and cannot track completion.
   - PROJECT_PLAN updates were queued (“Next Steps” in feedback) but not reflected in repo—`docs/manager/PROJECT_PLAN.md` remains untouched today.

4. **Guardrails Enforcement Consistency**
   - Multiple agents are still missing direction-file adjustments to match restored assets (e.g., Ads still references `app/lib/ads/roas.ts` which no longer exists). The manager role needs to enforce reconciliation between direction docs and actual repo state after the deletion event.

## Balanced Recommendations

### Immediate Recovery (Today/Tomorrow)
1. **Restore Critical Assets:** Partner with each blocked agent (Engineer, Ads, AI-Customer, Integrations, Data, Product, Inventory) to recover or recreate the missing files called out in `reports/audits/2025-10-15-agent-feedback-audit.md`. Don’t delegate this blindly; own the coordination.
2. **Sanitize Archives & Confirm Guardrails:** Replace the archived tokens with placeholders, re-run Gitleaks, capture output, and log the mitigation. Verify GitHub push protection and document proof in feedback.
3. **Convert Direction Tasks to Issues:** For each agent, open GitHub Issues with DoD, Acceptance Criteria, and Allowed paths. Link direction-file tasks to their corresponding Issue numbers to reinstate traceability.

### Continuous Improvement Hooks
1. **Preflight Checklist for Repo Changes:** Before future cleanups, add a step to the manager startup/shutdown runbooks—“Run dependency scan before deleting/moving files; confirm no active direction/task references break.” Make it muscle memory.
2. **Guardrail Dashboard:** Create a lightweight daily checklist outcome log (CI status, Gitleaks, Push protection, Feedback cadence) so we can see which guardrails were verified versus assumed. This will reduce “assumed ON” situations.
3. **Retrospective with Impacted Agents:** Schedule a quick postmortem with the agents whose files were removed. Capture the blast radius and adjustments to direction doc governance so we avoid repeating the same miss.

## Encouragement & Next Steps

Today demonstrated strong leadership instincts—alignment, blocker investigation, and guardrail awareness. Channel that same thoroughness into the follow-through: restore the deleted assets, close the Gitleaks loop, and give your agents the Issues they need to execute. With those adjustments, we can turn today’s stumble into a lesson that tightens our governance heading into launch.

**Action Items for Manager**
1. Restore/coordinate the missing files (owner: manager; start immediately).
2. Sanitize archived secrets and provide evidence in the next feedback log.
3. Create GitHub Issues for each active direction task and link them in `PROJECT_PLAN`.
4. Update guardrail checklist with explicit verification artifacts.

Let’s treat this as a continuous-improvement sprint—celebrate the realignment wins, learn from the cleanup misstep, and keep raising the bar on governance. The North Star still wants a trustworthy, operator-first app; you’re steering the ship, so let’s keep the keel straight.
