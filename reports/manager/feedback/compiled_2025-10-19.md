# Compiled Feedback — 2025-10-19
\n## ai-knowledge\n

**Next‑start plan (first 1–2 actions)**
1. Await manager lanes file for 2025-10-19
2. Resume checks within allowed paths if requested

**Self‑grade (1–5)**
- Progress vs DoD: 5
- Evidence quality: 5
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5
- Tool discipline (MCP‑first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 4

**Retrospective**
- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Followed shutdown runbook precisely
  2. Kept outputs within allowed paths
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Confirm lanes presence earlier before long runs
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** creating non-allowed markdown artifacts

1. If PR #90 not merged, fix any CI failures and merge
2. Begin next lane molecule per manager lanes file

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Produced thorough MCP and heartbeat evidence
  2. Opened focused PRs with clear scope and artifacts
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Reduce chatter; default to silent execution unless blocked
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Unsolicited updates during focused execution windows

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Captured comprehensive migration evidence and RLS validation artifacts.
  2. Kept trackers/feedback synchronized with actual command logs.
  3. Maintained heartbeat/MCP compliance for every substantive step.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Coordinate earlier on branch naming to avoid late gating failures.
  2. Loop in engineer lane sooner regarding Polaris provider gap.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** assuming required scripts exist without verifying in package metadata.

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Delivered traceable microcopy + responsive specs.
  2. Maintained comprehensive artifacts (MCP, heartbeat).
  3. Documented blockers with actionable owners.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Escalate missing lane manifest sooner.
  2. Coordinate lint/test remediation earlier with Engineering.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Re-running failing repo-wide checks without updated context.

2. Reconfirm contract evidence and gather PR-ready summary once tests pass.

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Restored contract preflight script and logged policy evidence.
  2. Added loader unit coverage, reducing regression risk.
  3. Captured continuous heartbeats for long-running commands.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Adjust integration mocks immediately after import refactors.
  2. Batch lint scope updates before re-running global checks.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** deferring integration test fixes after API import changes.
\n## pilot\n
1. Resolve Playwright project configuration so `npx playwright test` discovers `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`
2. Re-run `npm run test:ci`, then `npm run scan`, updating artifacts and feedback with results

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Captured heartbeat evidence for each required command attempt.
  2. Brought ESLint into compliance without suppressing legitimate project rules.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Validate Playwright project discovery locally before running full CI.
  2. Stage secrets scan earlier once tests are green.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Allowing config gaps (like Playwright testDir) to linger without re-verifying suite discovery immediately after edits.

\n## qa\n
**Evidence:**
- All artifacts stored in `artifacts/qa/2025-10-19/` with SHA256 verification
- Heartbeat logs capture full command execution traces
- Blocker files document 5-point verification for P1-A and P2-TESTS
- Comprehensive QA execution summary with rollback recommendations

**Blockers:**
- **P1-A (BLOCKS RELEASE):** Missing `app/lib/analytics/schemas.ts` prevents build and accessibility tests
- **P2-TESTS:** 7 integration tests failing due to incomplete shopify.server mock (96.2% overall pass rate)

**Recommendation:** BLOCK release until Engineer creates app/lib/analytics/schemas.ts with required Zod schemas (ConversionResponseSchema, RevenueResponseSchema, TrafficResponseSchema). After P1-A resolution, rerun full test suite.

**Autonomous Execution:** Successfully executed entire startup checklist without user intervention using NO-ASK/NO-INTERRUPT protocol, applied 5-point blocker verification, and continued with fallback work queue when blocked.

**Execution completed:** 2025-10-19T00:45:00Z
**Total artifacts:** 21 files with SHA256 verification
**Agent:** QA (autonomous)
**Mode:** NO-ASK / NO-INTERRUPT
