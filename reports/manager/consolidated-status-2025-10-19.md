## P0 Critical Blockers (4)

### 1. ENG-000-P0: 590 Lint Errors (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Impact**: Blocks DevOps CI, Engineer ENG-011 molecule, production deployment

- **Root Cause**: 578 `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` violations, 10 missing return types
- **Owner**: Engineer
- **ETA**: 2 hours
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ASSIGNED in `docs/directions/engineer.md` v3.0

### 2. ENG-000-P1: Server Won't Start (CRITICAL PATH)
- **Impact**: Blocks Pilot (11 molecules), Designer (15 molecules), local dev
- **Error**: `SyntaxError: The requested module 'react-router' does not provide an export named 'json'`
- **Root Cause**: React Router 7 deprecated `json` export
- **Owner**: Engineer
- **ETA**: 30 minutes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ASSIGNED in `docs/directions/engineer.md` v3.0

### 3. ADS-000-P0: getPlatformBreakdown Test Failure

- **Error**: Empty list handling in `tests/unit/ads/platform-breakdown.spec.ts:75`
- **Owner**: Ads
- **ETA**: 20 minutes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ASSIGNED in `docs/directions/ads.md` v3.0

- **Owner**: Inventory, Support
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ASSIGNED in respective direction files v3.0

---

## P1 High Priority

### Git/PR Management
- **Issue**: 20 conflicting PRs closed, Manager PR #97 contains all session work
- **Impact**: 10 completed agents awaiting PRs
- **Owner**: Manager
- **Action**: Create 10 sequential PRs for completed agents (per RULES.md - agents never touch git)
- **ETA**: 2-3 hours (sequential to prevent git contamination)

---

## Governance Alignment

### ‚úÖ North Star Review Complete
- **Action**: Removed deprecated GA4 and Supabase MCPs from NORTH_STAR.md, README.md, OPERATING_MODEL.md
- **Correction**: Updated MCP server count from 6 ‚Üí 4 (GitHub Official, Context7, Fly.io, Shopify Dev)
- **Guidance Added**: Use Supabase CLI and built-in GA4 API connectors
- **Evidence**: `reports/manager/north-star-review-2025-10-19.md`

### ‚úÖ Direction Files Updated
- **Files**: 18 total (16 agents + 1 template + 1 pilot created)
- **P0 Unblockers**: Prepended to Engineer, Ads, Inventory, Support
- **Framework**: All references confirm React Router 7 (NOT Remix)
- **MCP Corrections**: No deprecated MCP references found in any direction file
- **Molecule Count**: All lanes have 15-20 molecules (Manager accountability: CLEAR)

## Shopify App Status

**CLI Version**: 3.85.4 ‚úÖ  
**Config File**: `shopify.app.toml` created ‚úÖ  
**Status**: Not linked to Partners account (client_id empty)  
**Next Step**: User must run `shopify app dev` to link app and obtain client_id  
**Webhooks Configured**: app/uninstalled, app/scopes_update  
**Scopes**: read_orders, read_products, read_inventory, read_locations, read_customers, read_assigned_fulfillment_orders, read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders

## Production Readiness Assessment

### QA Verdict: NO-GO
**Justification**: 4 P0 blockers preventing deployment

**Blocking Issues**:
1. ‚ùå 590 lint errors prevent CI green status
2. ‚ùå Server won't start blocks local dev and UX validation
3. ‚ùå 11 unit test failures (97.1% vs 100% target)
4. ‚ùå Missing /health endpoint (FIXED by Engineer ENG-001)

**Estimated Time to Green**: 3.5 hours total
- ENG-000-P0 (lint): 2 hours
- ENG-000-P1 (server): 30 minutes
- ADS/INV/SUP test fixes: 1 hour combined

### Post-Unblocker Recommendations
1. Engineer fixes all P0 blockers
2. QA retests: UNIT + SMOKE + DATA/DB + A11Y
3. Product generates new Go/No-Go report
4. Manager creates 10 PRs for completed agents
5. Pilot completes remaining 11 molecules (UX validation)
6. Designer completes 15 molecules (visual review)
