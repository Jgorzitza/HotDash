## üîç Duplicate Task Analysis

**Issue Reported**: Agents reporting duplicate tasks

**Investigation Results**:
- ‚úÖ No duplicate task IDs found in database
- ‚úÖ All task IDs are unique
- ‚úÖ Some agents completed KB search tasks (not duplicates, just similar names)

**Examples of Similar (Not Duplicate) Tasks**:
- `ADS-004` and `ADS-005` - Different tasks, both completed
- `SEO-002` and `SEO-003` - SEO-002 marked as duplicate of SEO-003 by agent
- `DATA-002` - KB search + actual task (different completion entries)

**Conclusion**: No actual duplicates. Agents were seeing KB search completions alongside task completions.
