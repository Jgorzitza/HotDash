**Date**: 2025-10-19T16:10:00Z
**Issue**: Agents blocked by 20 conflicting PRs
**Resolution**: Closed all conflicting PRs, created fresh manager PR

## What Was Blocking Agents

**Problem**: 20 open PRs, 19 with merge conflicts
- All PRs created before manager's direction updates
- Direction files completely rewritten (React Router 7, Context7 MCP, P0 fixes)
- Old agent work conflicts with new directions
- Agents couldn't merge old PRs, couldn't start new work

**Agent Reports**: "Git tasks are Manager's responsibility - please resolve"
