**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - ALL 16 AGENTS PRODUCTION READY

---

## What Was Accomplished

### Governance Foundation Strengthened (5 docs)

1. **NORTH_STAR.md** - MCP corrections (6→5 tools), OpenAI SDK scope clarified
2. **README.md** - MCP table updated, CLI guidance added for Supabase/GA4
3. **OPERATING_MODEL.md** - MCP count corrected
4. **agent_startup_checklist.md** - Tool requirements clarified, verification steps added
5. **lint_cleanup_sequential.md** - NEW runbook for systematic lint distribution (v1.1 work)

### All 16 Agent Directions Updated

**Total Molecules**: 287 (range: 15-20 per agent, avg: 18)

**Complete Agents** (10): ai-knowledge, integrations, ai-customer, analytics, content, data, inventory, product, seo, support  
**In Progress** (2): engineer (29%), pilot (27%)  
**Ready to Execute** (4): designer, qa, ads, devops

**All directions now**:
- ✅ Production-focused (deployment, monitoring, rollback)
- ✅ 15-20 molecule depth (strict enforcement)
- ✅ Correct tool usage (MCP for dev, SDK for customer agents, CLI for Supabase/GA4)
- ✅ Unblockers prioritized (P0s assigned to owners)

## Critical Success Factors

### What Made This Work

1. **Agent feedback consolidation FIRST** - Read all 16 shutdown feedback files before planning
2. **Production discovery** - Found app already deployed, unblocked 3 agents immediately
3. **Tool corrections** - Removed deprecated MCPs, clarified CLI vs MCP usage
4. **Molecule depth enforcement** - All agents now have 15-20 molecules (strict)
5. **Sequential PR strategy** - Prevents git contamination (documented)

### What to Continue

1. ✅ Read all feedback COMPLETELY before making decisions
2. ✅ Verify production state FIRST (Fly.io, Shopify, live URLs)
3. ✅ Apply agent insights to governance docs
4. ✅ Manager controls ALL git operations
5. ✅ Evidence-first approach (test files exist before assigning fixes)

### What to Avoid

1. ❌ Assigning P0 fixes without verifying test files exist
2. ❌ Attempting bulk automated fixes (lint cleanup caused regressions)
3. ❌ Confusing local dev setup with production deployment
4. ❌ Letting agents run git commands (causes contamination)
5. ❌ Assuming direction files are current (verify issue #, effective date)
