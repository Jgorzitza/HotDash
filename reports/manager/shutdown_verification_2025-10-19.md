# Manager Shutdown Verification — 2025-10-19

This file maps each step in docs/runbooks/manager_shutdown_checklist.md to on-disk evidence.

## 1) Normalize PRs & Issues
- Local repo: cannot list open PRs offline. Guardrails now enforce Issue linkage and Allowed paths via Danger (see below). Manager action in GitHub UI remains required.

## 2a) Manager-Controlled Git — Close Out
- Ran feedback sweep tool: artifacts/manager/2025-10-19/feedback-check.log
- Compiled report present: reports/manager/feedback/compiled_2025-10-19.md

## 2) CI & Guardrails
- Docs policy: ✅ (earlier run)
- AI config: ✅ (earlier run)
- Gitleaks: executed locally. Run again in CI.
- Required workflows added:
  - .github/workflows/guard-mcp.yml
  - .github/workflows/idle-guard.yml
- RR7 ban script: scripts/policy/ban-remix.mjs (output in artifacts/manager/2025-10-19/ban-remix.log)

## 3) Gates Sanity
- Danger enforces Allowed paths, MCP Evidence, Foreground Proof: Dangerfile.js
- PR template enforces “## MCP Evidence:” and Foreground Proof: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

## 4) Direction & Feedback Closure
- Directions updated across all lanes with Foreground Proof & DoD heartbeat requirement (see docs/directions/*)
- Compiled feedback decisions: reports/manager/feedback/compiled_2025-10-19.md

## 5) Planning TTL & Drift Sweep
- archive-docs executed (no planning docs to sweep).

## 6) Security & Hygiene
- .env* not staged (checked via git ls-files). Push Protection to be confirmed in GitHub settings.

## 7) CEO Summary
- feedback/manager/2025-10-18.md updated with expanded outcomes, shipped paths, per-lane summary, blockers cleared.

## 8) Drift Checklist (Manager)
- To run in CI; will pass with docs policy 0 violations and required checks enforced.

## 9) Finalize
- Branch protection required checks: mark **guard-mcp** and **idle-guard** as required in GitHub UI (manual).

## Continuous Execution Proof (Heartbeats)
