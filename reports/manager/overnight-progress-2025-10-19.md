- DevOps D-001 not complete by Hour 2 (no credentials = all agents blocked)
- Build still broken by Hour 4 (Engineer E-001 not complete)

- CI completely red with no path forward

**MORNING ESCALATION** (Report at 08:00):
- <23 molecules complete (below minimum viable)
- Any P0 blocker still unresolved
- CI not green
- Staging not ready

**NO ESCALATION NEEDED** (Green Status):
- ≥23 molecules complete
- All P0 blockers resolved
- CI green
- Agents reporting steady progress
