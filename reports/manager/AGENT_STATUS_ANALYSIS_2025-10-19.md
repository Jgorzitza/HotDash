## KEY FINDINGS

### Missing Directories Blocking Multiple Agents
- `app/lib/ads/**` - Ads agent blocked
- Other service directories may be missing too

### Agents Say "READY_FOR_DIRECTION_UPDATE"
- Support, Inventory, Analytics, Ads, Integrations
- They completed previous work, awaiting next tasks

### Agents at 100% But Not Merged
- Content (PR #90)
- Designer (awaiting coordination)

## MANAGER ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: CREATE MISSING DIRECTORIES (Immediate)
Create all missing service directories so agents aren't blocked

### Phase 2: CLEAN IDLE AGENT FEEDBACK (Immediate)
Idle agents consolidate their feedback and archive old entries

### Phase 3: UPDATE DIRECTION FILES (Remove Blockers, Add Production Tasks)
- Remove: MCP credential requirements (use CLI)
- Remove: Missing directory blockers (create them first)
- Add: Production-focused deep task lists
- Focus: Ship to production

### Phase 4: APPEND TASKS TO WORKING AGENTS
Keep active agents busy with more production-focused work
