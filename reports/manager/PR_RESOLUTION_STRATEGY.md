# PR Resolution Strategy - Clean Slate Approach

**Date**: 2025-10-19T16:00:00Z
**Issue**: 19/20 open PRs have merge conflicts, blocking agents
**Resolution**: Close conflicting PRs, start fresh with updated directions

---

## Current Situation

**Open PRs**: 20
**Conflicting**: 19 (95%)
**Mergeable**: 1 (PR #44, but failing CI)

**Root Cause**: 
- All PRs created before manager's direction updates
- Direction files completely rewritten (React Router 7, Context7 MCP, P0 RLS fix)
- Agent work from old directions now conflicts with new directions

**Impact**: Agents blocked - can't merge old work, can't start new work

---

## Manager Decision: CLOSE CONFLICTING PRS

**Rationale**:
1. All directions rewritten (16 files, 241 new molecules)
2. Framework changed (Remix â†’ React Router 7 clarity)
3. Database security added (P0 RLS fix)
4. Old PRs based on outdated direction (not aligned)
5. Merge conflicts require manual resolution (not worth time)

**Better Approach**: Fresh PRs from updated directions
