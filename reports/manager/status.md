# Manager Status — 2025-10-18

- Gap analysis integrated: specs/configs added for Programmatic SEO, Guided Selling, SEO Telemetry, A/B, Site Search, Media Pipeline, Merch Playbooks, Learning Loop, Garage OS, AN‑Vision.
- Autopublish toggles present and OFF (see docs/specs/hitl/approvals-framework.config.json).
- North Star / Operating Model / Rules updated to reflect MCP clarifications (Shopify via MCP; GA4/GSC via adapters), Action Dock metric, and evidence policy.
- Startup/Shutdown runbooks updated with MCP/adapters guidance and priority sequence.
- Lanes manifest expanded to all teams with tasks including DoD, flags, proof-call templates: reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-18.json.
- Blockers to Green documented with owners/next steps: reports/manager/BLOCKERS_TO_GREEN.md.
- Next: Team alignment broadcast — Today’s sequence:
  1) Programmatic SEO Factory (SEO, planning, flags OFF)
  2) Guided Selling/Kit Composer (Engineer, planning after build green)
  3) CWV→$$ (Analytics, spec update + tile verification)
  4) A/B harness (Product, config + verification)
  All lanes remain HITL; autopublish OFF.
- Evidence discipline enforced: code PRs require MCP transcripts or adapter command logs per RULES.
- No customer/CEO-facing content ops; all work stays dev/staging behind flags with previews/rollbacks.
- Pending: staging build failure tail triage; gitleaks job check in GH; Supabase staging IPv4 pooler confirm.
