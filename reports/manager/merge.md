## Loop Delta
- Rewrote all agent direction files (`docs/directions/*.md`) to production-aligned template with references to NORTH_STAR, OPERATING_MODEL, RULES.
- Logged fresh feedback for every agent dated 2025-10-17; each includes evidence commands and next steps.
- Refreshed `reports/status/STATUS.md` with new snapshot; documented sandbox + CI billing escalations.
- Raised escalations: workspace-write sandbox remains read-only; GitHub Actions billing still failing.

## Outstanding Work
- Resolve sandbox write permissions so automation lanes can resume.
- Close GitHub Actions billing issue and rerun full CI (fmt/lint/test:ci/scan/Gitleaks).
- Coordinate Data/Analytics migration rehearsal and production window once CI restored.
