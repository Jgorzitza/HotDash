## Next Milestone & Deploy Order

### Phase 1: Lane Activation (Next 2 Hours)
**ALL 16 lanes execute first 3 molecules**:
- Engineer: Create /health route, fix integration tests, start UI
- Data: Document schema, run RLS tests, verify remote migrations
- DevOps: CI green, prepare staging deploy
- All others: Start first molecules from new directions

**Target**: 48 molecules complete (3 × 16 lanes)

### Phase 2: Core Features (Hour 3-6)
**Priority lanes complete core work**:
- Engineer: All 8 tiles + approvals drawer functional
- Analytics: Real GA4/Shopify data wired
- DevOps: Staging deployed and validated
- QA: Integration + E2E tests passing

**Target**: 80-100 molecules complete

### Phase 3: Staging Validation (Hour 7-9)
**Cross-lane coordination**:
- Data: Staging migrations applied
- Integrations: All 6 contracts verified
- QA: Full E2E on staging
- Pilot: UX validation
- Product: Go/No-Go report

**Target**: Staging 100% validated, GO decision ready

### Phase 4: Production Deploy (Hour 10-12)
**Sequential deployment** (DevOps leads):
1. CEO reviews Go/No-Go → Approve
2. Data: Production DB migration (60 min)
3. DevOps: Production app deploy (45 min)
4. QA + Pilot: Production smoke tests (30 min)
5. DevOps: 24-hour monitoring begins

**Target**: Production live, healthy, monitored

### Merge Order (Safest Path)
1. Docs + tests (no prod impact) - Continuous
2. Backend services (flags OFF) - After staging validates
3. UI components - Progressive
4. Feature flag activation - Week 1-4 rollout
