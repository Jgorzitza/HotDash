# Agent Shutdown Consolidation — 2025-10-16

## Ads
- Completed nine-module ads analytics stack (`app/lib/ads/*`, `app/services/ads/recommendations.ts`, `app/routes/ads.dashboard.tsx`) covering tracking, ROAS, budget optimisation, attribution, and HITL recommendations.
- No automated tests shipped; coordinate with Analytics/QA to validate formulas and dashboard rendering.

## AI-Customer
- Agents SDK scaffolding, grading UI, RAG tool, escalation heuristics, and learning sinks implemented (`app/agents/**`, `app/components/grading/*`).
- Vitest configuration stabilised via vmThreads; full suite still red due to Publer integration mocks—`tests/integration/social.api.spec.ts` failing until adapter/auth fixes land.

## AI-Knowledge
- Knowledge ingestion, learning, and idea-bridge services delivered with passing unit suites (`app/services/knowledge/*.ts`, `tests/unit/services/knowledge/*.spec.ts`).
- Ready to coordinate with Data/DevOps once Supabase migrations are applied.

## Analytics
- GA4 traffic dashboard route created (`app/routes/analytics.traffic.tsx`) with channel-level metrics and caching.
- Awaiting navigation wiring and staging data validation.

## Content
- Social post drafter now outputs full HITL approval packages with tests (`app/services/content/post-drafter.ts`, `tests/unit/services/content/post-drafter.spec.ts`).
- Dependent on Publer adapter/auth repairs before live posting.

## Data
- Supabase approvals schema, fixtures, and documentation created (`supabase/migrations/20251016_approvals_drawer_schema*.sql`, `supabase/seed_approvals_fixtures.sql`, `docs/specs/approvals_schema.md`).
- Needs manager/DevOps to apply migrations and verify RLS on staging.

## Designer
- Dashboard tile spec complete (`docs/design/dashboard-tiles.md`), awaiting new marching orders; request manager direction refresh to avoid idle time.

## DevOps
- Completed CI/CD, health checks, alerting, Prometheus metrics, backups, and DR runbooks (`.github/workflows/*`, `app/routes/metrics.ts`, `scripts/backup/*`, `docs/runbooks/disaster_recovery.md`).
- Files remain uncommitted and require secrets (`NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_*`, `SUPABASE_*`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`) before activation.

## Engineer
- Built approvals drawer, dashboard shell, and tile integrations; unit tests blocked without Polaris `AppProvider` helper.
- Needs harness refactor plus live data wiring to replace fixtures.

## Integrations
- Shopify read APIs, Supabase RPC routes, Chatwoot health, and social endpoints delivered with extensive documentation.
- Publer adapter still targets Ayrshare base URL and social routes lack Shopify auth; integration tests failing until corrected.

## Inventory
- Reorder point service with full test coverage added (`app/services/inventory/rop.ts`, `tests/unit/services/inventory.rop.spec.ts`).
- Next step: hook into Shopify sync/PO generator tasks.

## Product
- Produced acceptance criteria, success metrics, training, comms, rollback, monitoring, and iteration plan docs (`docs/specs/*`).
- Documentation ready for launch gating; keep in sync with engineering progress.

## QA
- Comprehensive audit logged; after harness tweaks reported `npm run test:unit` passing, but integrations still red and Playwright specs remain skipped.
- Needs to deliver AppProvider helper, unskip E2E, and reinstate daily health summaries.

## SEO
- Anomaly pipeline, diagnostics, success metrics, idea brief workflow, and migrations completed with tests (`app/lib/seo/*.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20251016162000_idea_seo_briefs.sql`).
- Waiting on migration apply and idea pool integration verification.

## Support
- RAG index built, KB ingestion, triage, and SLA monitoring services in place (`scripts/rag/build-index.ts`, `app/services/support/*`).
- Ready to integrate with Chatwoot once approvals data live.

## Notes
- Several teams highlighted dependency on applying Supabase migrations and fixing Publer/social auth before progress continues.
- Preserve this summary for manager coordination; remove after sprint once consolidated into formal planning.
