## Blockers

### 1. URGENT_DATE_CORRECTION.md - Forbidden Ad-Hoc File Pattern
- **File:** docs/directions/URGENT_DATE_CORRECTION.md
- **Severity:** BLOCKER
- **Category:** Forbidden Patterns (No Ad-Hoc Files)
- **Description:** File matches forbidden pattern `URGENT_*.md` as specified in NORTH_STAR.md lines 106 and RULES.md line 49. The 3-Question Test was not followed:
  - Q1: Can this go in feedback/manager.md? YES ‚Üí Should have used that
  - This is a status update that belongs in `feedback/manager/2025-10-19.md`
- **Code:**
  ```markdown
  # üö® URGENT: Date Correction for All Agents ‚Äî 2025-10-19

  **Issue**: Multiple agents wrote feedback to `2025-10-20.md` files
  **Reality**: Today is **October 19, 2025**
  **Action Taken**: All Oct 20 feedback has been consolidated to Oct 19 files
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  1. Delete `docs/directions/URGENT_DATE_CORRECTION.md`
  2. Move content to `feedback/manager/2025-10-19.md` under "Date Correction Notice"
  3. Update direction files WITHOUT creating ad-hoc notification file
  4. Content in direction files (date correction section) is acceptable

### 2. Missing Issue Linkage
- **File:** PR #104 body
- **Severity:** BLOCKER
- **Category:** Issue Linkage (DoD Requirement)
- **Description:** PR body does not contain "Fixes #<issue>" or any GitHub issue reference. OPERATING_MODEL.md line 28-30 requires: "Every PR must include `Fixes #<issue>` in the body."
- **Recommendation:** Add issue linkage to PR body before merge

## Warnings

### 1. vitest.config.ts Not in Allowed Paths
- **File:** vitest.config.ts
- **Severity:** WARN
- **Category:** Allowed Paths Compliance
- **Description:** PR body declares allowed paths as "docs/directions/**, feedback/manager/**" but modifies `vitest.config.ts` which is outside this scope. Change appears minimal (1 addition, 0 deletions).
- **Code:**
  ```diff
  +++ b/vitest.config.ts
  @@ -0,0 +1 @@
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  1. Either add "vitest.config.ts" to allowed paths in PR body
  2. Or remove this change from PR if not essential
  3. If essential, document why Manager is modifying test config

### 2. Direction Content Changes - Analytics Discrepancy
- **File:** docs/directions/analytics.md
- **Severity:** WARN
- **Category:** Content Verification
- **Description:** Analytics direction update includes "CRITICAL - WORK VERIFICATION REQUIRED" warning about missing files that were reported complete. This indicates potential git history issue or agent work loss.
- **Code:**
  ```markdown
  **Problem**: You reported 5 files complete on Oct 19, but they don't exist in repo:
  - app/lib/analytics/shopify-returns.stub.ts ‚ùå
  - app/lib/analytics/sampling-guard.ts ‚ùå
  - scripts/sampling-guard-proof.mjs ‚ùå
  - scripts/dashboard-snapshot.mjs ‚ùå
  - scripts/metrics-for-content-ads.mjs ‚ùå
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Manager should verify Analytics work status before merging this PR. May indicate need for Analytics agent to re-execute work.

## Next Steps

### Critical Actions (Before Merge)
1. **DELETE** `docs/directions/URGENT_DATE_CORRECTION.md` (forbidden pattern)
2. **MOVE** date correction content to `feedback/manager/2025-10-19.md`
3. **ADD** issue linkage to PR body ("Fixes #<number>")
4. **UPDATE** allowed paths in PR body to include vitest.config.ts OR remove that change
5. **VERIFY** Analytics work status (missing files issue)

### Post-Merge Actions
1. Archive `URGENT_DATE_CORRECTION.md` if accidentally merged (immediate rollback)
2. Update Manager direction to reinforce 3-Question Test adherence
3. Consider automated CI check for forbidden filename patterns
