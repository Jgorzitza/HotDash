# STATUS — 2025-10-17

## Alignment Sources
- docs/NORTH_STAR.md, docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md, docs/RULES.md
- Updated directions (`docs/directions/*.md`)
- Feedback logs dated 2025-10-17 (`feedback/<agent>/2025-10-17.md`)
- reports/manager/merge.md, reports/manager/ESCALATION.md

## Agent Snapshot
- **Ads:** Slice A merged; Slice B/C queued with ≤50-file guardrail. Pending Meta/Google creds and lint debt.
- **AI-Customer:** Playwright suites green with mock admin storage; Supabase edge logger stub outstanding.
- **AI-Knowledge:** Ingestion stub + OpenAI assumptions documented; awaiting Allowed paths, credentials, HITL workflow.
- **Analytics:** Shopify returns adapter mocked; Supabase migrations awaiting DevOps window.
- **Content:** Idea pool fixtures + copy QA ready; need analytics metrics + CEO tone approval.
- **Data:** Staging rehearsal scheduled; production migration window pending.
- **Designer:** Production microcopy/responsive specs drafted; CEO/QA sign-off outstanding.
- **DevOps:** CI billing escalation open; staging apply rehearsal scheduled; drift sweep automation pending.
- **Engineer:** Idea drawer harness & accessibility fixes landed; finalize Playwright tagging with QA.
- **Integrations:** Mocked Supabase contract tests passing; wait for Data migrations before enabling live calls.
- **Inventory:** ROP/payout tests green; awaiting production migration slot & Support training.
- **Manager:** Directions/feedback refreshed; sandbox write escalation blocking automation lanes.
- **Product:** Launch checklist & comms draft ready; blockers: CI billing, sandbox escalation, migrations.
- **QA:** Scope packet drafted; accessibility suite scheduled tonight.
- **SEO:** Anomaly triage doc + vitals tests ready; need Product approval + analytics metrics for recommendations.
- **Support:** Webhook retry tests drafted; runbook update & AI-Customer grading feed pending.

## Cross-Cutting Risks
- Workspace-write sandbox keeps sub-agents read-only; automation lanes paused.
- GitHub Actions billing issue blocks CI guardrails (fmt/lint/test:ci/scan).
- Shopify/Supabase credential rollout required for analytics/data migration work.
- Repo lint debt must be resolved before launch window.

## Immediate Actions
1. Resolve sandbox + CI billing escalations with DevOps; relaunch automation lanes.
2. Coordinate Data/Analytics migrations (staging rehearsal → production window).
3. Ensure each agent executes contract tests and logs evidence in 2025-10-17 feedback before next sync.
