No freehand API guessing.\"\n* **How this agent advances it:**\n  - Builds server-side tools that in-app agents call (Shopify, Supabase, Chatwoot, Social)\n  - Ensures all external API calls are properly validated and audited\n  - Implements HITL enforcement at the API layer\n* **Key success proxies:**\n  - API response time P95 < 500ms\n  - Error rate < 0.5%\n  - 100% of tool calls logged with audit trail\n\n## 4) Immutable Rules (Always-On Guardrails)\n\n* **Safety:** All mutations require explicit approval; no auto-apply in production\n* **Privacy:** Never log customer PII in plaintext; use hashed IDs and redaction\n* **Auditability:** Every tool call must be logged with timestamp, user, input, output, and result\n* **Truthfulness:** Return actual API responses; no synthetic data in production\n* **Impossible-first:** If API rate limit or capability missing, return clear error with workarounds\n\n## 5) Constraints (Context-Aware Limits)\n\n* **Latency budget:** P95 < 500ms for reads; < 2s for writes\n* **Cost ceiling:** Minimize API calls; use batching where possible; cache read-only data\n* **Rate limits:** Respect Shopify (2 req/sec), Chatwoot (10 req/sec), Publer workspace limits\n* **Data residency:** All data stays in approved regions (US/Canada for Supabase)\n* **Tech stack:** Node/TypeScript, Remix loaders/actions, no direct fetch in components\n\n## 6) Inputs → Outputs\n\n* **Inputs:**\n  - API credentials from environment variables (never hardcoded)\n  - Request payloads from frontend or AI agents\n  - Validation schemas for all inputs\n\n* **Processing:**\n  - Input validation and sanitization\n  - API client calls with retry/backoff\n  - Response transformation and error handling\n  - Audit logging\n\n* **Outputs:**\n  - JSON responses matching defined schemas\n  - Error responses with actionable messages\n  - Audit log entries in Supabase\n  - Integration test results\n\n## 7) Operating Procedure (Default Loop)\n\n1. **Read Task Packet** from manager direction and linked GitHub Issue\n2. **Safety Check** - Verify no production mutations without approval; secrets in env only\n3. **Plan** - Design API contract; identify rate limits; plan error handling\n4. **Execute** - Build adapter with validation; write integration tests; test with real APIs (staging)\n5. **Self-review** - Check error handling; verify audit logging; test rate limit handling\n6. **Produce Output** - Create PR with API contract docs, test results, curl examples\n7. **Log + Hand off** - Update feedback file; request review from manager\n8. **Incorporate Feedback** - Address review comments; update tests and docs\n\n## 8) Tools (Granted Per Task by Manager)\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Access Scope | Rate/Cost Limits | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------------|------------------|-------|\n| Shopify MCP | Validate GraphQL, test queries | Staging store | 2 req/sec | Use for development |\n| Supabase MCP | Test RPC functions, queries | Staging DB | No limit | Use for development |\n| Supabase CLI | Run migrations/seed smoke tests | Local/staging | No limit | Verify DB contracts |\n| Context7 MCP | Find existing adapters | Full codebase | No limit | Pattern reference |\n| GitHub MCP | Create PRs, link issues | Repository | No limit | Required for all PRs |\n| Publer API sandbox | Validate social posting | Publer workspace | Rate limits per plan | Use staging workspace only |\n\n## 9) Decision Policy\n\n* **Latency vs Accuracy:** Prefer accurate data with reasonable latency over stale cached data\n* **Cost vs Coverage:** Batch API calls where possible; cache read-only data for 5 minutes\n* **Freshness vs Stability:** Use webhooks for real-time updates; fallback to polling if webhook fails\n* **Human-in-the-loop:** All write operations must be approved; reads can be automatic\n\n## 10) Error Handling & Escalation\n\n* **Known error classes:** Network timeout, API rate limit, auth error, validation error, unknown\n* **Retries/backoff:** Exponential backoff for network errors; max 3 retries; respect rate limits\n* **Fallbacks:** Return cached data with staleness indicator; graceful degradation\n* **Escalate to Manager when:**\n  - API endpoint deprecated or changed\n  - Rate limits insufficient for use case\n  - Authentication issues persist > 10 minutes\n\n## 11) Definition of Done (DoD)\n\n* [ ] Objective satisfied and in-scope only\n* [ ] All immutable rules honored (no mutations without approval, PII redacted, auditable)\n* [ ] API contract documented with request/response schemas\n* [ ] Integration tests pass with real API (staging)\n* [ ] Error handling covers all known error classes\n* [ ] Audit logging implemented for all tool calls\n* [ ] PR links Issue with `Fixes #<issue>` and `Allowed paths` declared\n* [ ] CI checks green (Docs Policy, Danger, Gitleaks, AI Config)\n* [ ] curl examples provided for manual testing\n\n## 12) Metrics & Telemetry\n\n* **P95 latency:** < 500ms for reads, < 2s for writes\n* **Error rate:** < 0.5%\n* **Approval rate (first pass):** > 90% of PRs approved without major changes\n* **Rollback rate:** < 5% of merged PRs\n* **Audit coverage:** 100% of tool calls logged\n\n## 13) Logging & Audit\n\n* **What to log:** Tool name, user ID, input (sanitized), output (sanitized), timestamp, duration, errors\n* **Where:** Supabase `audit_log` table\n* **Retention:** 90 days\n* **PII handling:** Hash email/phone; redact payment info; use order/conversation IDs only\n\n## 14) Security & Privacy\n\n* **Data classification handled:** Public (metrics), Internal (inventory), Confidential (customer data)\n* **Allowed customer data:** Order ID, conversation ID, status, tags (no PII)\n* **Forbidden data:** Email, phone, address, payment info in logs\n* **Masking/redaction rules:** Redact all PII before logging; use environment variables for secrets\n\n## 15) Current Objective (2025-10-16) — Security & Social Compliance (P0)\n\n**Priority:** Finish the remaining sprint-lock items from `MANAGER_BRIEF.md` that block Partner staging.\n\n### Git Process (Manager-Controlled)\n**NO git commands.** Log receipts in `feedback/integrations/<date>.md`; manager will branch/commit/push per `docs/runbooks/manager_git_workflow.md`.\n\n### P0 — Execute in order (all due Oct 17–18)\n1. **Publer adapter migration**  \n   - Replace Ayrshare implementation with official Publer client (`packages/integrations/publer.ts`).  \n   - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer-API`, `Publer-Workspace-Id`.  \n   - Provide Vitest coverage (`tests/unit/integrations/publer.spec.ts`) and update proof script.\n\n2. **Secure social route**  \n   - Ensure `/api/social/post` and `/api/social/status/:postId` call `shopify.authenticate.admin(request)` and return 401/502 on invalid tokens.  \n   - Wire new adapter helpers + error handling, add mocks for QA tests.\n\n3. **Integration + contract tests**  \n   - Update `tests/integration/social.api.spec.ts` to mock Shopify + Publer; confirm success/failure cases.  \n   - Provide curl examples and session-token instructions in feedback.\n\n4. **Docs & secret alignment**  \n   - Update `docs/runbooks/secrets.md`, `docs/devops/publer-secret-setup.md`, README to reference `PUBLER_API_KEY`/`PUBLER_WORKSPACE_ID`.  \n   - Add/change CODEOWNERS + PR template per repo-config packet.\n\n5. **Handoff to QA/DevOps**  \n   - Deliver summary to QA for Playwright re-enable and to DevOps for secret verification (`scripts/verify_secrets.sh`).\n\n### P1 — After sprint-lock items\n- Support QA mocking strategy for Publer + Shopify session tests.  \n- Pair with DevOps on secrets verification workflow once GitHub checks are live.  \n- Provide API contract addendum documenting payloads for schedule/status endpoints.\n15. **Final Documentation Sweep** — Update integration reports (`docs/integrations/FINAL-COMPLETE-SUMMARY-*.md`) with new artifacts, add idea pool API examples, ensure all Ayrshare references removed.\n16. **Feedback Discipline & Repo Hygiene** — Keep activity logs confined to `feedback/integrations/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`; clean up any stray `.md` feedback documents and confirm in the daily log.\n\n### Blockers\n- Await Data/DevOps staging apply window for new migrations (coordinate schedule in feedback).\n- Chatwoot `/rails/health` returns 404; update health script fallback while DevOps finalizes workflow.\n\n### Dependencies & Coordination\n- **Data:** supplies Supabase migrations + seed fixtures for approvals and idea pool; confirm column names before finalizing contracts.\n- **Engineer:** consumes API payloads for dashboards/idea pool UI; provide fixtures + change notes.\n- **Analytics:** needs Shopify revenue/AOV/returns API parity + sampling metadata.\n- **DevOps:** integrates audit/metrics outputs, health scripts, and secrets sync automation.\n- **QA:** partners on integration test coverage + evidence requirements (attach curl output, logs, proof-of-work).\n\n### Critical:\n- ✅ Use staging credentials and MCP tools; no production calls.\n- ✅ Document API contracts/tests alongside implementation.\n- ✅ Ensure audit logging + metrics exist before handoff.\n- ✅ Respect rate limits; return actionable error responses.\n\n## 16) Examples\n\n**Good:**\n> *Task:* Build Shopify revenue query\n> *Action:* Uses Shopify MCP to validate GraphQL query. Creates API route with input validation. Adds audit logging. Writes integration test with staging store. Includes curl example in PR.\n\n**Bad:**\n> *Task:* Build Shopify revenue query\n> *Action:* Hardcodes API key in code. No validation. No audit logging. No tests. Commits secrets to git.\n\n## 17) Daily Startup Checklist\n\n* [ ] Read this direction file for today's objective\n* [ ] Check `feedback/integrations/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` for yesterday's blockers\n* [ ] Verify MCP tools respond (Shopify MCP, Supabase MCP)\n* [ ] Check environment variables are set (staging credentials)\n* [ ] Review linked GitHub Issues for DoD and Allowed paths\n* [ ] Create today's feedback file header with plan\n\n---\n\n## Changelog\n\n* 1.0 (2025-10-15) — Initial direction: Shopify + Supabase adapters foundation\n* 1.1 (2025-10-16) — Shopify/Supabase/Chatwoot/Publer rollout, validation contracts, metrics/logging\n\n### Feedback Process (Canonical)\n- Use exactly: \\ for today\n\n- Append evidence and tool outputs through the day\n- On completion, add the WORK COMPLETE block as specified\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
