Diff the feature pack Supabase schema against `supabase/migrations/**` and produce a migration plan in feedback.\n2. Author combined migration for idea pool tables/views (`supabase/migrations/20251017_idea_pool_bundle.sql`) with rollback script.\n3. Update analytics aggregates/views to include idea KPIs and CX metrics; attach SQL diff.\n4. Extend inventory + CX RLS policies to cover new idea pool tables; document rationale.\n5. Implement RLS tests in `supabase/rls_tests.sql` covering idea, analytics, approvals tables.\n6. Wire `scripts/data/apply-migrations.mjs` to run new bundle on staging; capture CLI output.\n7. Refresh Supabase seeds (`supabase/seeds/`) with idea pool + analytics fixtures.\n8. Generate SQL fixtures powering dashboard tiles (revenue, AOV, returns, approvals, idea pool); store in `tests/fixtures/`.\n9. Build Supabase RPC/edge functions from feature pack list and confirm contract with integrations.\n10. Coordinate with Integrations to publish API schema JSON for analytics + idea endpoints; attach API contract diff.\n11. Produce data lineage doc in `docs/specs/analytics_pipeline.md` reflecting new jobs.\n12. Install nightly data quality job verifying Supabase metrics vs GA4/Publer (script stub + schedule).\n13. Add Supabase metrics instrumentation (Prometheus) for ingestion success/failure; document thresholds.\n14. Validate `npm run test:ci -- --runInBand` after migrations applied; attach logs.\n15. Run `scripts/data/backfill-analytics.mjs` for historical data through May 1; share summary.\n16. Deliver rollback playbook for idea pool schema in `docs/runbooks/migration_rollback.md`.\n17. Partner with Analytics on sampling guard inputs and publish dataset dictionary in `docs/specs/metrics_snapshots_qa_ceo.md`.\n18. Write feedback to `feedback/data/2025-10-17.md` and clean stray md files.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **Allowed Tools:** `bash`, `node`, `npm`, `npx prettier`, `supabase`, `psql`, `rg`\n- **Touched Directories:** `docs/directions/data.md`\n- **Budget:** ≤ 45 minutes, ≤ 5,000 tokens, ≤ 3 files modified/staged\n- **Guardrails:** Do not edit other direction files; uphold Supabase security and analytics compliance guardrails.\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] Objective satisfied with Supabase launch backlog scoped to feature pack deliverables.\n- [ ] `npm run fmt`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:ci`, and `npm run scan` executed with proofs attached to feedback or PR.\n- [ ] Migrations, RLS policies, seeds, fixtures, and rollback scripts produced with CLI evidence captured.\n- [ ] API contracts, specs, and runbooks updated to reflect analytics and idea pool changes.\n- [ ] Feedback entry committed to `feedback/data/2025-10-17.md` with outputs and stray markdown cleanup recorded.\n\n## Risk & Rollback\n\n- **Risk Level:** Medium — inaccurate backlog jeopardizes data readiness.\n- **Rollback Plan:** `git checkout -- docs/directions/data.md` before staging.\n- **Monitoring:** Align tasks with backlog T3 + feature pack schemas.\n\n## Links & References\n\n- North Star: `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`\n- Feature Pack Schema: `integrations/new_feature_20251017T033137Z/manager_agent_pack_v1/03-database/`\n- API Contracts: `integrations/new_feature_20251017T033137Z/manager_agent_pack_v1/04-api/`\n- Data Specs: `docs/specs/analytics_pipeline.md`\n- Feedback: `feedback/data/`\n\n## Change Log\n\n- 2025-10-17: Version 1.0 – Template rewrite with explicit launch tasks.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Follow this policy before launching any batched work.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Autonomy** – operate without human prompts once the batch begins.\n2. **Security** – verify secrets are never committed; all credential access goes through vault tooling.\n3. **Traceability** – every sub-agent emits JSON events (`reports/runs/<BATCH_ID>/<task_id>/exec.log.jsonl`).\n4. **Tight Scope** – no wide refactors unless the task direction labels the change as `wide-change`.\n5. **Continue-until-done** – loop planning/execution until the milestone is complete or a single, specific blocker is logged in `reports/manager/ESCALATION.md`.\n\n## Required Artifacts\n\n- `reports/manager/plan.json` – task decomposition with budgets and DoD.\n- `reports/manager/kickoff.md` – batch goals, risks, and parallelization.\n- `reports/runs/<BATCH_ID>/<task_id>/direction.md` – task packet using `docs/directions/agenttemplate.md`.\n- `reports/manager/merge.md` – rolling summary of PRs, status checks, and merge decisions.\n- `reports/manager/ESCALATION.md` – only when a blocker needs explicit input.\n\n## Guardrail Checklist\n\n- [ ] Guardrail branch `guardrails-<BATCH_ID>` merged before feature work.\n- [ ] CI statuses enforced: `ci`, `gitleaks`.\n- [ ] Branch protection documented; no force push to `main`.\n- [ ] Pre-commit hook (`scripts/policy/pre-commit.sh`) installed via `npm run setup`.\n- [ ] Secret scan command: `npm run scan`.\n- [ ] Manager plan + kickoff generated before launching sub-agents.\n\n## Sub-Agent Expectations\n\n- Read the task `direction.md` and stay within scope.\n- Emit newline-delimited JSON events with `type`, `ts`, `task_id`, `msg`, and metrics.\n- Produce a focused PR with passing tests, docs updates, and rollback notes.\n\n## Escalation Policy\n\nIf progress is blocked, create `reports/manager/ESCALATION.md` containing:\n\n```\n# Escalation – <YYYY-MM-DD>\n- **Need**: one-line item (credential/tooling decision/etc.)\n- **Context**: what failed, links to logs, why alternatives do not work\n- **Impact**: what remains blocked until resolved\n```\n\nResume work on other lanes while waiting for the escalation to resolve.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
