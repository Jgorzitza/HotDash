Overwrite the file with `docs/directions/agenttemplate.md` structure.\n2. Use the exact task list below (numbered 1–18):\n   1. Validate Supabase metrics vs GA4 (`scripts/ops/check-analytics-parity`) and attach comparison log.\n   2. Instrument idea pool KPIs (adoption, win rate, time-to-publish) within Supabase views and analytics pipeline; link SQL diff.\n   3. Build sampling guard proof harness (`scripts/sampling-guard-proof.mjs`) and capture results.\n   4. Implement dashboard tile telemetry (revenue, AOV, returns, approvals, ideas) using Prometheus metrics; attach output.\n   5. Generate analytics fixtures for unit tests (`app/lib/analytics/fixtures.ts`) covering new KPIs; document usage.\n   6. Coordinate with Engineer to expose instrumentation hooks in dashboard tiles; confirm via test logs.\n   7. Backfill analytics aggregates to May 1 using `scripts/backfill-analytics.mjs`; share summary.\n   8. Publish idea KPI API endpoint contract (`app/routes/api.analytics.idea-pool.ts`) alignment notes; attach diff reference.\n   9. Extend GA4 anomaly alerts to include idea pool and Publer metrics; document thresholds.\n   10.

Pair with Product to ensure analytics tile success metrics match launch checklist; record meeting notes in feedback.\n   17. Produce regression report on sampling guard runs (pass/fail history) and attach to feedback.\n   18. Write feedback to `feedback/analytics/2025-10-17.md` and clean stray md files.\n3. Populate Objective/Constraints/DoD/Risk/Links referencing GA4, Supabase, Publer requirements.\n4. Add changelog entry for 2025-10-17.\n5. Run `npx prettier --write docs/directions/analytics.md`.\n6. Stage only `docs/directions/analytics.md`.\n7.
