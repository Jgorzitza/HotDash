# Post-Intake Note â€” task_feature_pack_audit

The initial attempt failed due to Drive DNS restrictions, but the follow-up run installed `gdown`, downloaded the archive, and captured file tree + checksums. See updated summary (`reports/runs/20251017T033137Z/task_feature_pack_audit/summary.md`) and intake README for final state. No further action required.
