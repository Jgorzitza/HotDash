Replace the file with the template from `docs/directions/agenttemplate.md`.\n2. Use this task list (1–16):\n   1. Validate SEO anomaly alerts (`app/lib/seo/diagnostics.ts`) against Supabase data; document results.\n   2. Produce keyword briefs for each idea pool suggestion (including wildcard) and store in `docs/specs/seo_pipeline.md`.\n   3. Align Publer first-comment keywords with analytics KPIs; update `docs/specs/seo_backlog.md`.\n   4. Draft meta title/description templates for upcoming campaigns; attach examples.\n   5. Refresh structured data/JSON-LD guidance in `docs/specs/frontend_overview.md` for idea pool items.\n   6. Collaborate with Content to ensure tone + SEO guidelines aligned; capture notes in feedback.\n   7. Create SEO QA checklist for dashboard and idea pool pages and store in `docs/specs/seo_pipeline.md`.\n   8. Run lighthouse/SEO audits on staging build; attach report.\n   9. Monitor Publer post performance vs SEO KPIs; summarise weekly in feedback.\n   10. Build FAQ schema suggestions for support knowledge base updates; log deliverable.\n   11. Ensure analytics sampling guards include SEO metrics; coordinate with Analytics.\n   12. Update `docs/specs/seo_backlog.md` prioritisation, owner, status.\n   13. Document fallback plan for SERP anomaly (escalation path) in `docs/runbooks/logging.md` or dedicated SEO runbook.\n   14. Validate canonical URLs + sitemap updates for new pages; log audit results.\n   15. Prepare post-launch SEO retrospective template capturing metrics and experiments.\n   16. Write feedback to `feedback/seo/2025-10-17.md` and clean stray md files.\n3. Populate Objective/Constraints/DoD/Risk/Links with SEO tooling (Lighthouse, GA4, Supabase).\n4. Add changelog entry for 2025-10-17.\n5. Run `npx prettier --write docs/directions/seo.md`.\n6. Stage only `docs/directions/seo.md`.\n7. Note blockers in `feedback/manager/2025-10-17.md` if required.\n\n## Constraints\n- **Allowed Tools:** `bash`, `node`, `npm`, `npx prettier`, `lighthouse`, `rg`.\n- **Touched Directories:** `docs/directions/seo.md`.\n- **Budget:** ≤ 30 minutes, ≤ 4,000 tokens, ≤ 3 files modified/staged.\n- **Guardrails:** Restrict edits to SEO direction file.\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] Template applied with provided tasks.\n- [ ] Prettier executed.\n- [ ] Only `docs/directions/seo.md` staged.\n- [ ] Blockers logged if any.\n\n## Risk & Rollback\n- **Risk Level:** Low — misaligned SEO reduces traffic lift.\n- **Rollback Plan:** `git checkout -- docs/directions/seo.md` before staging.\n- **Monitoring:** Ensure tasks align with anomaly alerts, Publer strategy, and analytics dependencies.\n\n## Links & References\n- Template: `docs/directions/agenttemplate.md`\n- SEO specs: `docs/specs/seo_pipeline.md`, `docs/specs/seo_backlog.md`\n- Analytics alignment: `docs/specs/analytics_pipeline.md`\n- Feedback: `feedback/seo/`\n\n## Change Log\n- 2025-10-17: Version 1.0 — Template rewrite with SEO launch tasks.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
