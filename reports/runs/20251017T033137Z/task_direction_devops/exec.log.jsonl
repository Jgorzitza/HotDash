Overwrite the file using the template from `docs/directions/agenttemplate.md`.\n2. Use the following task list verbatim (re-numbered as needed):\n   1. Apply the Supabase idea pool + analytics migrations to staging (`supabase db push`) and capture the CLI output in feedback.\n   2. Run `supabase test db` (or `psql` harness) for RLS checks covering idea pool tables; attach results.\n   3. Seed staging with feature pack fixtures (`supabase db seed`) and document evidence.\n   4. Produce a staging readiness note (`docs/runbooks/devops_execution_summary.md`) summarising migration status.\n   5. Automate Chatwoot health workflow (`.github/workflows/health-check.yml`) invoking `scripts/ops/check-chatwoot-health.{mjs,sh}` nightly; store artifacts in `artifacts/ops/`.\n   6. Automate Publer health workflow verifying `/account_info` + `/social_accounts` with staging/prod secrets; persist JSON outputs.\n   7. Wire health workflows to notify `justin@hotrodan.com` via Fly/Email on failure; record notification dry run.\n   8. Expand `scripts/ops/sync-secrets.sh` to pull Publer + Chatwoot credentials from vault and sync to Fly/GitHub.\n   9. Audit GitHub Actions secrets vs vault (`scripts/ops/load-mcp-secrets.sh`) and report drift.\n   10. Rehearse Fly production deploy (`fly deploy --config fly.toml --strategy immediate --env production`) using staging image; capture logs & rollback command.\n   11. Add CI guard (`.github/workflows/check-ci-guardrails.yml`) enforcing manager batch policy + wide-change opt-in.\n   12. Implement rollback script (`scripts/ops/rollback-production.sh`) with tested Fly + Supabase restore steps.\n   13. Configure Prometheus alerts (`prometheus-alerts.yml`) for tile latency + idea pool ingestion failures; link to runbook.\n   14. Validate `scripts/backup/` pipeline by executing `npm run backup` → restore dry run; document evidence.\n   15. Update `docs/runbooks/production_deployment.md` with new deploy/rollback flow, linking to feature pack guardrails.\n   16. Pair with QA to expose health artifact links in daily report; document integration notes.\n   17. Confirm `npm run ci`, `npm run scan`, and `npm run test:ci` pass on manager-batch branch with updated workflows.\n   18. Write feedback to `feedback/devops/2025-10-17.md` and clean stray md files.\n3. Populate Objective/Constraints/DoD/Risk/Links to reflect launch guardrails and required commands.\n4. Add changelog entry for 2025-10-17.\n5. Run `npx prettier --write docs/directions/devops.md`.\n6. Stage only `docs/directions/devops.md`.\n7. Note blockers in `feedback/manager/2025-10-17.md` if needed.\n\n## Constraints\n- **Allowed Tools:** `bash`, `node`, `npm`, `npx prettier`, `supabase`, `flyctl`, `rg` (read-only searches).\n- **Touched Directories:** `docs/directions/devops.md`.\n- **Budget:** ≤ 45 minutes, ≤ 5,000 tokens, ≤ 3 files modified/staged.\n- **Guardrails:** Do not edit other direction files.\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] Template applied with Objective/Constraints/DoD/Risk/Links.\n- [ ] Task list matches the items above and ends with the feedback hygiene task.\n- [ ] Prettier executed on the file.\n- [ ] Only `docs/directions/devops.md` staged.\n- [ ] Blockers logged if encountered.\n\n## Risk & Rollback\n- **Risk Level:** Medium — inaccurate direction compromises launch readiness.\n- **Rollback Plan:** `git checkout -- docs/directions/devops.md` before staging.\n- **Monitoring:** Ensure tasks align with backlog T2/T6 and feature pack ops docs.\n\n## Links & References\n- Template: `docs/directions/agenttemplate.md`\n- Feature Pack Ops: `integrations/new_feature_20251017T033137Z/manager_agent_pack_v1/07-ops/`\n- Supabase schema: `integrations/.../03-database/supabase_schema.sql`\n- Health scripts: `scripts/ops/`\n- Feedback: `feedback/devops/`\n\n## Change Log\n- 2025-10-17: Version 1.1 — Template rewrite with explicit launch tasks.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
