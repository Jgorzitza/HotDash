# CEO Alignment Report
## 1. Executive Summary
- Approvals, idea pool, and growth workflows now span UI (`app/components/approvals/ApprovalsDrawer.tsx`), data (`supabase/migrations/20251016_*.sql`), and API layers (`app/routes/api/ideas.live.ts`, `app/routes/api/supabase.*`), giving us functional coverage of the launch surface.
- DevOps delivered production-grade observability‚Äîscheduled health checks, Prometheus metrics, alerting, backups, and disaster recovery documentation‚Äîacross `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `app/routes/metrics.ts`, and `scripts/backup/`.
- Content, SEO, Inventory, Support, Analytics, and AI-knowledge agents landed well-tested services that align to the North Star metrics.
- We are **~60% to live**: core features exist, but the approvals stack still runs on fixtures, Supabase migrations are not applied, social tooling points at the wrong provider, and the release pipeline lacks validated secrets/tests. Shipping is blocked on a handful of high-severity fixes.
- Immediate focus: harden Publer/social posting, apply Supabase migrations with RLS verification, unblock QA test harnesses, configure GitHub secrets, and run a staging smoke before Partner deployment.

## 2. Current Status (Table)
| Deliverable | Status | Owner(s) | Notes / Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Approvals UI (drawer, routes, tiles) | üöß Functionally Ready | Engineer + QA | UI and fixtures shipped, but unit suite still fails without a Polaris `AppProvider`; relies on fixture data only. Target: harness + live data by **2025-10-17**. |
| Supabase approvals & idea pool migrations | ‚è≥ In Progress | Data + DevOps | Migrations live under `supabase/migrations/20251016_*` yet to be applied/tested on staging with RLS. Target: apply + rollback drill **2025-10-17**. |
| Idea pool APIs & SEO/knowledge bridge | üöß Functionally Ready | Integrations + SEO + AI-knowledge | `/api/ideas/*` endpoints, diagnostics, and brief bridge exist; waiting on migration apply and auth checks. Target: staging validation **2025-10-18**. |
| Dashboard metrics feed | üöß Functionally Ready | Engineer + Integrations + Analytics | `/api/shopify.*`, `/api/supabase.metrics.ts`, and dashboard route wired; needs live Supabase data + regression tests. Target: tile smoke tests **2025-10-18**. |
| Publer adapter & social routes | üß© Blocked or Undefined | Integrations + AI-customer + Content | Adapter still hits Ayrshare (`packages/integrations/publer.ts:34`), social routes import with `.ts`, and lack session auth; integration tests fail. Resolve before enabling posting. |
| Chatwoot health check & CX backend | ‚úÖ Complete & Tested | Integrations + Support | `/api/chatwoot.health.ts` ready; triage/SLA services covered with tests. Hook into monitoring workflows next sprint. |
| Observability & deploy workflows | üöß Functionally Ready | DevOps | Health checks, backups, alerting implemented but uncommitted and secrets (`NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_*`, `SUPABASE_*`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`) still unset. Activate workflows **2025-10-17**. |
| QA automation & release gating | üß© Blocked or Undefined | QA + Engineer | Vitest suite regressed (ApprovalsDrawer tests fail), Playwright specs skipped, perf/security scripts missing. Needs harness + test orchestration. |
| Shopify Partner deploy readiness | ‚è≥ In Progress | DevOps + Manager | Workflows exist, but no staging smoke on latest code and Partner env vars untouched. Schedule deploy rehearsal once above blockers clear. |

## 3. Feature Map
- **Operator Dashboard** ‚Äì Seven tiles (`app/routes/dashboard.tsx`) consume Shopify Admin metrics (`app/routes/api/shopify.*`), Supabase views (`app/routes/api/supabase.metrics.ts`), SEO anomalies (`app/routes/api.seo.anomalies.ts`), and Chatwoot queue data. Depends on Supabase migrations + Prometheus telemetry for SLA metrics.
- **Approvals Drawer & Lifecycle** ‚Äì Drawer UI (`app/components/approvals/ApprovalsDrawer.tsx`), idea routes (`app/routes/ideas*.tsx`), and actions (`app/routes/api/manager.ideas.*`, `/api/approvals/*`) rely on Supabase approvals tables, Data migrations, and QA harness to enforce HITL evidence.
- **Always-On Idea Pool** ‚Äì Idea APIs (`/api/ideas/live`), SEO briefs (`app/services/seo/brief.ts`), AI-knowledge bridge (`app/services/knowledge/idea-bridge.ts`), and fixtures coordinate with Supabase tables and analytics tasks to keep 5 suggestions live (1 wildcard).
- **Customer Support Loop** ‚Äì Chatwoot health (`/api/chatwoot/health`), triage (`app/services/support/triage.ts`), SLA monitoring (`app/services/support/sla-monitor.ts`), and RAG index (`scripts/rag/build-index.ts`, `app/services/knowledge/ingestion.ts`) feed approvals for ai-customer workflows.
- **Growth & Social Posting** ‚Äì Content drafter (`app/services/content/post-drafter.ts`), Ads insights (`app/services/ads/recommendations.ts`), Publer adapter (`packages/integrations/publer.ts`), and analytics dashboards integrate Supabase metrics, Publer API, and approvals guardrails.
- **Observability & Ops** ‚Äì Health checks (`.github/workflows/health-check.yml`), metrics endpoint (`app/routes/metrics.ts`), backups (`scripts/backup/*`), alerting (`.github/workflows/alert.yml`), and disaster recovery runbook (`docs/runbooks/disaster_recovery.md`) ground the deployment story on Fly.io + Supabase.

## 4. Agent Grades
- **Ads ‚Äî B**: Delivered a broad analytics/optimization suite (`app/lib/ads/*`, `app/routes/ads.dashboard.tsx`) but lacks automated tests or data validation; pair with Analytics/QA to write Vitest covers and integrate real metrics.
- **AI-Customer ‚Äî C+**: Agents SDK scaffolding, grading UI, and tools exist (`app/agents/**`), yet integration tests still fail against Publer endpoints and social routes remain unstable. Focus on stabilizing mocks, fixing Publer auth, and getting `tests/integration/social.api.spec.ts` green.
- **AI-Knowledge ‚Äî A**: Ingestion, learning, and idea-bridge services (`app/services/knowledge/*.ts`) plus tests landed cleanly; next step is coordinating with Data/DevOps to apply migrations and wire runtime RAG usage.
- **Analytics ‚Äî A**: Traffic dashboard (`app/routes/analytics.traffic.tsx`) and GA4 breakdown functions shipped with tests; add navigation hooks and stage data sanity checks.
- **Content ‚Äî A-**: HITL post drafter + tests (`app/services/content/post-drafter.ts`) align with approvals spec; await Publer fix before integrating with live adapter.
- **Data ‚Äî A-**: Comprehensive approvals schema, fixtures, and docs (`supabase/migrations/20251016_approvals_drawer_schema.sql`) ready; needs staging apply + RLS verification with DevOps.
- **Designer ‚Äî B**: Dashboard and approvals specs completed (`docs/design/dashboard-tiles.md`), but direction file left stale; regroup with Product/Engineer to capture new Publer/idea specs.
- **DevOps ‚Äî A+**: Health checks, metrics, backups, alerting, and DR runbooks delivered (`.github/workflows/health-check.yml`, `scripts/backup/`); manager must commit files, configure secrets, and trigger first runs.
- **Engineer ‚Äî B**: Massive UI progress (approvals drawer, dashboard, idea routes) yet tests fail without Polaris harness and live data integration is pending. Prioritize AppProvider wrapper + QA fixes.
- **Integrations ‚Äî B**: Shopify/Supabase APIs, Chatwoot health, Publer routes, and docs are extensive, but adapter still references Ayrshare (`packages/integrations/publer.ts`) and social routes lack auth. Fix provider alignment and enforce Shopify session checks.
- **Inventory ‚Äî A**: ROP service + tests (`app/services/inventory/rop.ts`) ready for dashboard integration; follow through with Shopify sync + PO generator next.
- **Product ‚Äî A**: Acceptance criteria, success metrics, training, and monitoring plans (`docs/specs/*`) give clear definition of done; keep syncing docs with actual implementation status.
- **QA ‚Äî B-**: Audit surfaced genuine blockers (ApprovalsDrawer tests, E2E coverage), but suites remain red and harness work is incomplete. Deliver AppProvider helper, unskip Playwright specs, and resume daily health reporting.
- **SEO ‚Äî A**: Anomaly pipeline, diagnostics, idea briefs, and migrations (`app/lib/seo/pipeline.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20251016162000_idea_seo_briefs.sql`) complete with tests; await migration apply and idea pool wiring.
- **Support ‚Äî A**: RAG index, KB ingestion, triage, and SLA tooling (`scripts/rag/build-index.ts`, `app/services/support/*`) operational; integrate outputs into Chatwoot approval flow once migrations land.

## 5. Wins & Failures
- **Wins**
  - DevOps hardened delivery with continuous health checks, alerting, backups, and DR docs (`.github/workflows/health-check.yml`, `scripts/backup/README.md`, `docs/runbooks/disaster_recovery.md`).
  - Full approvals + idea pool stack now spans UI, APIs, data, and SEO/knowledge services, setting the stage for the HITL loop.
  - Support/Content/SEO/Inventory agents shipped well-tested services that match North Star success metrics and are ready for integration.
  - Analytics agent‚Äôs GA4 dashboard provides actionable growth telemetry for the CEO-facing workflows.
- **Failures / Inefficiencies**
  - Publer adapter still targets Ayrshare endpoints (`packages/integrations/publer.ts:34`) and social routes import with `.ts`, causing integration tests to fail‚Äîshipping blocker.
  - Social posting API (`app/routes/api/social.post.ts`) lacks Shopify session/auth validation and currently returns 500 on tests; critical risk before launch.
  - Supabase migrations (approvals, idea pool, SEO briefs) remain unapplied, so the UI/logic stack cannot hit real data yet.
  - QA automation isn‚Äôt guarding the release‚ÄîApprovalsDrawer unit suite fails, Playwright specs are skipped, and perf/security scripts are missing.
  - Observability workflows and secrets are uncommitted/configured, so none of the new monitoring runs in CI yet.

## 6. Security & Guardrail Audit
- **Critical**
  - `app/routes/api/social.post.ts`: No Shopify session/auth checks; any request with knowledge of the endpoint could attempt to post once secrets are set. Mitigation: enforce authenticated admin session + CSRF guard before enabling route.
- **High**
  - `packages/integrations/publer.ts:34`: Adapter still posts to Ayrshare; this breaks Publer commitment and risks sending credentials to the wrong host. Update base URL + payload schema per Publer docs and re-run integration tests.
  - Supabase approval/idea migrations (`supabase/migrations/20251016_*`) unapplied; RLS and permissions unverified. Apply to staging, validate RLS, and capture rollback evidence.
  - Workflow secrets (`NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_USERNAME/PASSWORD`, `SUPABASE_*`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `PUBLER_*`) remain unset‚Äîhealth checks/backups/alerts will fail silently. Configure secrets before merging DevOps workflows.
  - Manager idea endpoints (`app/routes/api/manager.ideas.$id.accept.ts`) rely on fixtures and lack explicit auth‚Äîensure Shopify admin enforcement before exposing.
- **Moderate**
  - Logger service (`app/utils/logger.server.ts`) uses Supabase service key; ensure it never executes client-side and gate calls in tests (guard added under NODE_ENV=test but needs documentation).
  - Integration tests still hitting real network calls; mock Publer/Chatwoot to avoid leaking tokens during CI.
- **Low**
  - Chatwoot health check logs conversation counts‚Äîconfirm no PII surfaces and add automated test once monitoring workflows activate.

## 7. Process & Discipline Review
- Documentation is comprehensive, but several direction files (e.g., `docs/directions/designer.md`, `docs/directions/engineer.md`) lag behind completed work; update to prevent planning drift.
- Large volumes of code remain uncommitted; follow the manager git workflow to branch, commit, and PR so CI can enforce guardrails.
- QA discipline slipped: unit suite is red, E2E specs are skipped, and daily health summaries stopped. Reinstate proof-of-work (tests, evidence screenshots) before marking tasks complete.
- Feedback loop largely respected‚Äîagents logged progress and blockers‚Äîbut ensure each file ends with WORK COMPLETE plus explicit test results to simplify review.

## 8. Strategic Alignment
- Vision alignment remains strong: the operator dashboard, approvals loop, idea pool, and HITL social drafts all map to North Star outcomes. However, without applying migrations and fixing Publer/social auth, we cannot meet the success metrics (continuous idea pool, HITL social posting, audit trails).
- Scope creep risk: Ads, Content, and Support delivered full subsystems ahead of integration; ensure these modules flow into the shared approvals loop rather than expanding standalone tooling.
- Reputational risk: Shipping without authenticated social routes or validated approvals data would violate HITL and security promises‚Äîmust be closed before Partner launch.
- Success looks like: applied Supabase schema with RLS proven, AppProvider/QA harness green, Publer adapter corrected, observability workflows running, and Shopify Partner staging proving OAuth + embedded admin with live data.

## 10. Summary & CEO Notes
- Core workflows are built, but we must close the gaps around Publer correctness, Supabase migration apply, auth on social endpoints, and automated test coverage before any launch decision.
- Recommend locking this sprint on the ten tasks above; once complete we can execute a Partner staging deploy and produce the launch report requested in the manager brief.
- Awaiting CEO confirmation that these priorities and due dates align with expectations; will immediately task agents once approved.
