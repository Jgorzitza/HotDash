## Runbook Highlights

### Monitoring Runbook Features
- Daily health check procedures
- Performance monitoring commands
- Resource utilization tracking
- Auto-scaling verification
- Troubleshooting guide
- Regular maintenance schedule (daily/weekly/monthly)

### Deployment Runbook Features
- 3-phase deployment process (Staging → Production → Validation)
- Pre-deployment checklist (environment, code, infrastructure, dependencies)
- Rollback procedures (3 methods: deployment, restart, scale-to-zero)
- Configuration management (fly.toml best practices, secret management)
- Resource sizing guidelines with scaling triggers
- Deployment monitoring procedures

### Incident Response Runbook Features
- 6-phase response process (Detection → Mitigation → Investigation → Communication → Resolution → Review)
- Severity-based response times (SEV-1: < 5min, SEV-2: < 15min, SEV-3: < 30min)
- 5 common failure scenarios with step-by-step resolutions
- 3-level escalation path (Reliability → Engineer+Reliability → Manager+Engineer+Reliability)
- Incident report template
- Monthly drill procedures

## Resource Sizing Strategy

### Initial Deployment (Conservative)
- **CPU**: 1 vCPU (shared)
- **Memory**: 512MB
- **Auto-scaling**: 0-2 machines
- **Rationale**: Start small, scale based on actual usage

### Scaling Triggers
**Scale Up Memory** when:
- Memory usage > 70% consistently
- OOM kills occurring
- Garbage collection frequent

**Scale Up CPU** when:
- CPU usage > 70% consistently
- Request queue building
- Response times degrading

**Scale Machine Count** when:
- Consistent traffic requiring > 1 machine
- Geographic distribution needed
- High availability required

## Alert Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Action)
1. **Service Down**: HTTP 5xx > 5% for 5 minutes
2. **High Latency**: P95 > 1000ms for 10 minutes
3. **OOM Kills**: Any OOM kill event

### Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely)
1. **Elevated Latency**: P95 > 500ms for 15 minutes
2. **High Memory**: Memory > 70% for 20 minutes
3. **Slow Auto-start**: Auto-start > 10s consistently

## Deployment Windows

### Recommended
- **Staging**: Anytime during business hours
- **Production**: Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm Central Time

### Avoid
- Fridays
- Weekends
- Holidays
- End of month/quarter

### Freeze Periods
- During active incidents
- Major company events
- Holiday periods

## Rollback Procedures

### Standard Rollback (< 5 minutes)
1. Log rollback decision
2. Get previous deployment version
3. Deploy previous version
4. Verify rollback success (60s wait)
5. Monitor for stability (10 min minimum)
6. Document completion

### Alternative Options
- **Machine Restart**: If rollback deployment fails
- **Scale to Zero**: Emergency only (takes service offline)

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment (< 5 min)
- Verify incident
- Check health endpoints
- Review logs
- Check machine status
- Determine severity

### Phase 2: Immediate Mitigation (< 10 min)
- Execute rollback (SEV-1)
- Restart machines (SEV-2)
- Document issue (SEV-3)

### Phase 3: Investigation (Parallel)
- Capture diagnostics
- Review deployments
- Check dependencies
- Identify root cause

### Phase 4: Communication
- SEV-1: Immediate notification, updates every 15 min
- SEV-2: Notify within 15 min, updates every 30 min
- SEV-3: Document within 30 min

### Phase 5: Resolution Verification (10+ min)
- Wait for stabilization
- Verify health checks
- Check error rates
- Verify performance
- Confirm auto-scaling
- Declare resolved

### Phase 6: Post-Incident Review (24 hours)
- Create incident report
- Update runbooks
- Implement preventions
