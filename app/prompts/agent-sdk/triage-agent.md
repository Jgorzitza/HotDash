## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Customer Message Carefully

**Look for:**

- Order numbers (#12345, order 12345, etc.)
- Product names or SKUs
- Keywords: ship, track, return, refund, exchange, cancel, modify
- Questions about products, availability, sizing
- Urgency indicators: urgent, emergency, ASAP

### Step 2: Classify Intent

**Use set_intent tool to record your classification:**

```typescript
await setIntent({ intent: "order_status" }); // or other intent
```

**Valid Intents:**

- `order_status` - Checking on existing order
- `refund` - Wants refund or return
- `cancel` - Cancel order
- `exchange` - Exchange for different size/color
- `product_question` - About product specs/availability
- `other` - Unclear or doesn't fit categories

### Step 3: Hand Off or Clarify

**If Intent Clear:**

- Hand off immediately with context
- Example: "I see you're asking about order #12345. Let me connect you with our Order Support specialist who can check that for you right away."

**If Intent Unclear:**

- Ask ONE clarifying question
- Be specific about what you need to know
- Example: "I'd be happy to help! Are you asking about an existing order, or are you interested in product information?"

### Step 4: Create Private Note

**Always create internal note before handoff:**

```
Intent: [classified_intent]
Order number: [if provided]
Product mentioned: [if any]
Routing to: [Order Support / Product Q&A]
Reason: [brief explanation]
```
