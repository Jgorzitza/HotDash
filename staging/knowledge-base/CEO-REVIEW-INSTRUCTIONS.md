## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### About the 404 Errors
Many pages returned 404 errors during scraping. This likely means:
- The URLs I used are incorrect
- The pages don't exist on hotrodan.com
- The pages are at different URLs

**Please provide:**
- Correct URLs for policies (shipping, refund, privacy, terms)
- Correct URL for FAQ page
- Correct URL for hose collection

**Or let me know:**
- If these pages don't exist yet on the website
- If we should use the content I created instead

### About Existing Content
The existing content was created by me (content agent) earlier today based on:
- Research of typical e-commerce policies
- Hot Rod AN product information
- Industry best practices

**This content has NOT been verified for accuracy against actual Hot Rod AN policies.**

**Critical to verify:**
- Warranty terms and coverage
- Return/refund policies and timeframes
- Shipping costs and methods
- Product specifications
- Contact information
- Business hours
