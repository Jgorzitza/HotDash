## PTFE Hose Issues

### Issue: Hose is Kinked or Bent
**Symptoms:** Reduced flow, visible kink in hose line  
**Causes:**
- Bent beyond minimum bend radius
- Improper routing
- Hose too short for application

**Solutions:**
1. Check minimum bend radius for your hose size:
   - AN-6: 2.5" minimum
   - AN-8: 3.0" minimum
   - AN-10: 3.5" minimum
2. Use 45¬∞ or 90¬∞ fittings to avoid sharp bends
3. Order longer hose if needed
4. Replace kinked hose (do not attempt to straighten)

**Prevention:** Plan routing before cutting hose, use angled fittings

---

### Issue: Hose End is Frayed or Damaged
**Symptoms:** Loose braiding, exposed inner liner, difficult fitting assembly

**Causes:**
- Cut with wrong tool
- Dull cutting blade
- Too much force during cutting

**Solutions:**
1. Use proper AN hose cutting shears (Hot Rod AN Part #: HRA-CUT-001)
2. Make clean, straight cuts
3. Trim away any loose braiding with sharp scissors
4. If inner PTFE liner is damaged, cut 1/2" off and retry
