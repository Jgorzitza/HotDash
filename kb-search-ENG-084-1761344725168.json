      "question": "How to implement Mobile Optimization - responsive design, mobile-first? What are the steps and requirements?",
      "answer": "To implement mobile optimization using responsive design and a mobile-first approach, follow these steps and requirements:\n1. **Design Specifications**: Ensure that the implementation matches the design specifications exactly as outlined in `docs/design/` (all 57 files). This includes adhering to the complete feature set without significant gaps (70% gaps are unacceptable) [Source 1].\n2. **Responsive Design**:\n   - Utilize CSS media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes (tablet, phone).\n   - Ensure that the UI elements are touch-friendly, with buttons sized at least 44x44 pixels [Source 12].\n   - Implement a responsive tile grid that adjusts based on the screen size [Source 12].\n3. **Mobile-First Approach**:\n   - Start the design and development process with mobile layouts before scaling up to larger screens. This ensures that the core functionalities are prioritized for mobile users [Source 12].\n4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Verify that the design meets WCAG 2.2 AA standards, which includes ensuring keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and appropriate color contrast [Source 1][Source 12].\n5. **Testing**:\n   - Use Chrome DevTools for testing responsive breakpoints and accessibility audits. Take screenshots before claiming that the UI has been tested [Source 2].\n   - Test the application on actual mobile devices to ensure that the user experience is seamless across different platforms [Source 2].\n6. **Documentation and Evidence**:\n   - Maintain documentation of the design and implementation process, including MCP evidence JSONL files and screenshots saved in the designated artifacts directory [Source 2][Source 8].\n   - Ensure that all changes are logged, and that the PR template includes sections for MCP Evidence, Heartbeat, and Dev MCP Check [Source 8].\n7. **Validation**: After implementation, conduct a validation process to ensure that all features are functioning as intended and that the design complies with the specifications. This includes a designer validation step to confirm that the implementation matches the design [Source 1][Source 12].\nBy following these steps, you can effectively implement mobile optimization through responsive design and a mobile-first approach.",

      "answer": "Common issues and solutions when implementing mobile optimization, particularly in responsive design and mobile-first approaches, include:\n1. **Design Compliance**: Ensure that the implementation strictly follows the design specifications outlined in the design documents. Deviations can lead to inconsistencies in user experience across devices. All features must match the design vision with no more than 30% gaps [Source 1].\n2. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Test the application across various screen sizes to ensure that the layout adapts correctly. Use tools like Chrome DevTools to verify responsive breakpoints for tablets and phones [Source 6].\n3. **Accessibility**: Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA standards, which includes keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and appropriate color contrast. Accessibility checks should be integrated into the design and development process to avoid issues later [Source 1][Source 4].\n4. **Performance Optimization**: Mobile devices often have less processing power and slower internet connections. Optimize images, minimize JavaScript, and ensure that the application loads quickly on mobile devices [Source 5].\n5. **User Interface Adjustments**: Elements should be easily tappable and not too close together to prevent misclicks. Ensure that buttons and links are appropriately sized for touch interactions [Source 3].\n6. **Testing and Validation**: Conduct thorough testing on actual mobile devices in addition to emulators. This includes validating the functionality of all interactive elements and ensuring that the user experience is seamless [Source 8].\n7. **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Implement a system for gathering user feedback on mobile usability and make iterative improvements based on this feedback [Source 2].\nBy addressing these common issues with the outlined solutions, teams can enhance the mobile optimization of their applications effectively.",

      "answer": "The integration of mobile optimization, specifically responsive design and mobile-first approaches, with the Growth Engine architecture is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources. However, it can be inferred that mobile optimization is a critical aspect of the overall user experience, which aligns with the goals of the Growth Engine to enhance customer engagement and product effectiveness.\nThe Growth Engine architecture emphasizes the use of front-end agents, such as the Customer-Front agent, which likely requires a responsive design to ensure optimal performance across various devices, including mobile. Additionally, the focus on analytics and user segmentation within the Growth Engine suggests that understanding mobile user behavior is essential for driving growth and improving product offerings.\nUnfortunately, specific details on how mobile optimization directly integrates with the Growth Engine architecture are not provided in the sources. Therefore, the exact mechanisms or strategies for this integration remain unknown.",
