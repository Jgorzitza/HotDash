      "question": "What are the best practices for engineer agent when working on Fix Chatwoot Webhook Dev Mode Bypass?",
      "answer": "The best practices for an engineer agent working on the Fix Chatwoot Webhook Dev Mode Bypass include the following steps:\n1. **Immediate Start**: After completing the startup checklist, begin working immediately without waiting for manager approval or reporting readiness to start. This ensures that tasks progress efficiently [Source 1].\n2. **Logging Progress**: Use `logDecision()` to log your progress as you work. This helps maintain transparency and allows for tracking of decisions made during the implementation process [Source 1].\n3. **Task Completion**: Focus on completing the current task before moving on to the next one. Continue working until all tasks are completed or you encounter a genuine blockage [Source 1].\n4. **Use of Fixtures**: If the UI requires sample approvals, create fixtures with `provenance.mode=\"dev:test\"`, include a `feedback_ref`, and ensure that the \"Apply\" option is disabled [Source 1].\n5. **Escalation Protocol**: If you are blocked for more than 10 minutes, log the blocker with the exact error or output in your feedback file and mention the manager in the issue with a proposed next step [Source 1].\n6. **MCP Tools Verification**: Before writing any code, pull the necessary documentation to ensure you are using the most up-to-date training data and tools, particularly the Shopify Dev MCP for Polaris and Shopify APIs [Source 8].\n7. **Follow Approval Workflow**: Ensure that all actions are logged and follow the centralized approval queue process, which includes risk assessments and audit trails [Source 2].\nBy adhering to these practices, the engineer agent can effectively contribute to the development and implementation of the Fix Chatwoot Webhook Dev Mode Bypass.",

      "question": "Common issues and solutions when implementing Fix Chatwoot Webhook Dev Mode Bypass",
      "answer": "The implementation of the Fix Chatwoot Webhook Dev Mode Bypass may encounter several common issues, along with potential solutions:\n1. **Database Migration Issues**: There is a risk of database migration problems that could break the application. To mitigate this, ensure that all migrations are read-only and applied manually to prevent data loss or corruption [Source 1].\n2. **Service Availability**: If the Chatwoot service experiences downtime (e.g., 503 errors), it is crucial to monitor the health checks and ensure that the service is restored to operational status. Implementing health check scripts can help confirm the service's availability before proceeding with further integrations [Source 5][Source 10].\n3. **Integration Health Checks**: Ensure that all integration health checks are functioning correctly. This includes verifying that the Chatwoot API token is updated and that the connection to the database is stable [Source 2].\n4. **Notification System**: If notifications (toast, banner, browser) are not working as expected, review the notification system's implementation to ensure all components are correctly integrated and functional [Source 7].\n5. **Real-Time Updates**: Issues with real-time updates can arise if the Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection is unstable. Regularly test the SSE connection to ensure it remains stable throughout the implementation [Source 1].\n6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error boundaries with retry mechanisms to handle any unexpected failures gracefully. This will improve user experience and system reliability [Source 1].\n7. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure that all components meet WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. Regular audits can help identify areas needing improvement [Source 1].\nIf you encounter issues not covered here, further investigation may be required, as specific problems related to the Chatwoot Webhook Dev Mode Bypass are not detailed in the provided sources.",
