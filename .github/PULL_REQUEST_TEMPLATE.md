- [ ] Ran secret scan: `git grep -i "api_key\|secret\|password\|token\|private_key" HEAD | grep -v "vault/"`
- [ ] No secrets detected or only in vault/ directory
- [ ] Verified no credentials in .env files tracked by git
- [ ] Checked no large files (>1MB) added accidentally: `find . -type f -size +1M -not -path "./.git/*" -not -path "./node_modules/*"`
- [ ] Reviewed git diff before commit for accidental additions

### Test Results
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit
# Paste output here - must show PASSING

# E2E tests (if UI changes)
npm run test:e2e
# Paste output here - must show PASSING

# Lint check
npm run lint
# Expected: No errors

# Type check
npm run typecheck
# Expected: No errors
```
