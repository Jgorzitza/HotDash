## Evidence ‚≠ê REQUIRED

<!-- All PRs must include evidence. See docs/git_protocol.md -->

### Test Results
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit
# Paste output here - must show PASSING

# E2E tests (if UI changes)
npm run test:e2e
# Paste output here - must show PASSING

# Lint check
npm run lint
# Expected: No errors

# Type check
npm run typecheck
# Expected: No errors
```

### Screenshots (if UI changes)
<!-- Drag and drop screenshots showing before/after or new functionality -->

### Evidence Artifacts ‚≠ê REQUIRED
<!-- All code changes MUST include evidence - see docs/git_protocol.md -->

**Link to evidence files** (choose relevant):
- Test results: `artifacts/<agent>/<timestamp>/test-results/`
- Screenshots: `artifacts/<agent>/<timestamp>/screenshots/`
- Performance reports: `reports/performance/<date>/`
- Migration logs: `artifacts/data/<timestamp>/migration-logs/`
- Cleanup evidence: `feedback/git-cleanup.md` (if cleanup-related)
- Deployment logs: `artifacts/deployment/<timestamp>/`

**Evidence must include**:
- [ ] Command executed (exact command with timestamp)
- [ ] Output/results (full output or link to file)
- [ ] Validation steps (how you verified it works)

**Example**:
```
Command: npm run test:unit
Timestamp: 2025-10-14T10:30:00Z
Output: artifacts/qa/2025-10-14/test-results.txt
Result: ‚úÖ 127/127 tests passed
```

### Secret Scan Results ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY
```bash
# REQUIRED: Run secret scan before every PR
# This is automated by git hooks, but verify manually:

# Method 1: Quick grep scan
git grep -i "api_key\|secret\|password\|token\|private_key" HEAD | wc -l
# Expected: 0 (or only documentation mentions in docs/, not in code)

# Method 2: Gitleaks (recommended - install if not present)
gitleaks detect --no-git -v
# Expected: "no leaks found"

# Method 3: Check specific patterns
git diff --cached | grep -E "(sk_|pk_|ghp_|gho_|sbp_|supabase_|SUPABASE_|SHOPIFY_)" || echo "No secrets found"
# Expected: "No secrets found"

# Paste results here:


```
