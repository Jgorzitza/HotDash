      "question": "How to implement Wire Storefront Sub-Agent to Agent SDK? What are the steps and requirements?",
      "answer": "To implement the Wire Storefront Sub-Agent to the Agent SDK, follow these steps and requirements:\n### Steps:\n1. **Understand the Agent Architecture**: Familiarize yourself with the interactive-only agent model, which includes the Customer-Front Agent and the Storefront Sub-Agent. The Storefront Sub-Agent is responsible for inventory queries, product details, and collection lookups using the Storefront API (read-only access) [Source 1].\n2. **Setup Development Environment**:\n   - Navigate to the repo root: `~/HotDash/hot-dash/`.\n   - Ensure you are on the correct daily branch as announced by the manager. Use the following commands:\n     ```bash\n     git fetch origin\n     git checkout agent-launch-20251022\n     git pull origin agent-launch-20251022\n     ```\n   - Verify the branch using `git branch --show-current` [Source 3].\n3. **MCP Tools Verification**: Before writing any code, pull the latest documentation from the MCP (MCP Tools Verification) to ensure you are using the most current APIs and tools [Source 3].\n4. **Implement the Sub-Agent Logic**:\n   - The Storefront Sub-Agent should execute queries using the Shopify Admin GraphQL API to retrieve inventory and product details.\n   - Ensure that the sub-agent owns the request and returns structured JSON data back to the Customer-Front Agent [Source 1].\n5. **Handoff Pattern**: Implement the handoff pattern where the Customer-Front Agent triages the request and decides whether to transfer to the Storefront Sub-Agent. The sub-agent will execute the necessary queries and return the results in a structured format [Source 1].\n6. **Testing and Validation**: After implementing the Storefront Sub-Agent, conduct thorough testing to ensure it correctly handles requests and integrates seamlessly with the Customer-Front Agent. Validate the responses for accuracy and compliance with the PII Broker requirements [Source 4].\n7. **Documentation and Evidence**: Document your implementation process and ensure that you provide MCP evidence in the required JSONL format for any code changes. This includes logging actions and maintaining a heartbeat for tasks that exceed two hours [Source 9].\n### Requirements:\n- **Technical Skills**: Proficiency in TypeScript and familiarity with the OpenAI Agents SDK, as the implementation will involve drafting responses and executing queries [Source 7].\n- **Access Control**: Ensure compliance with the ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) model, where the Storefront Sub-Agent has read-only access to the Storefront API [Source 4].\n- **HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)**: Implement a HITL workflow for any actions that require operator approval, especially for write operations or sensitive data handling [Source 4].\nBy following these steps and adhering to the outlined requirements, you can successfully implement the Wire Storefront Sub-Agent into the Agent SDK.",

      "question": "What are the best practices for integrations agent when working on Wire Storefront Sub-Agent to Agent SDK?",
      "answer": "The best practices for the integrations agent when working on the Wire Storefront Sub-Agent to Agent SDK include the following:\n1. **Daily Branch Coordination**: All agents must work on the same daily branch coordinated by the manager. Ensure to fetch the latest updates and check out the correct branch before starting any work [Source 3].\n2. **Handoff Pattern**: Follow the established handoff pattern where the Customer-Front Agent triages requests and transfers them to the appropriate sub-agent (Accounts or Storefront). The sub-agent then executes the necessary queries and returns structured JSON results [Source 1][Source 2].\n3. **Interactive Operations**: All agents should operate interactively, meaning they are invoked by front-end agents or operators rather than running autonomous polling loops. This ensures that all actions are contextually relevant and approved as needed [Source 1][Source 2].\n4. **Security Measures**: Implement the PII Broker for redaction of personally identifiable information (PII) in responses. Ensure that sensitive data is only accessible to operators and not included in public replies [Source 4].\n5. **Commit Style**: Use a conventional commit style when making changes, ensuring that the agent's name is included in the commit message. This helps maintain clarity in version control [Source 3][Source 9].\n6. **MCP Tools Verification**: Always verify tools and documentation from the MCP (Master Control Program) before writing any code. This ensures that the latest and most accurate information is being used [Source 3].\n7. **Logging Progress**: Log progress immediately as work is being done using the `logDecision()` function. This helps maintain a clear record of actions and decisions made during the development process [Source 7].\n8. **Approval Workflow**: Utilize the centralized approval queue for any actions that require operator review. This includes write operations that need human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval [Source 10].\nBy adhering to these best practices, integrations agents can ensure effective collaboration, maintain security, and enhance the overall quality of the integration process with the Wire Storefront Sub-Agent to Agent SDK.",

      "answer": "Common issues and solutions when implementing the Wire Storefront Sub-Agent to the Agent SDK include:\n1. **Integration with APIs**:\n   - **Issue**: Difficulty in executing Shopify GraphQL queries for inventory and product details.\n   - **Solution**: Ensure that the sub-agent is correctly configured to use the Storefront API in a read-only capacity. Verify that the queries are structured properly and that the necessary permissions are granted.\n2. **Data Handling**:\n   - **Issue**: Returning unstructured data or failing to format JSON responses correctly.\n   - **Solution**: The Storefront Sub-Agent should return structured JSON data as specified in the handoff pattern. Ensure that the data returned includes all necessary fields for the front agent to compose a reply.\n3. **Handoff Process**:\n   - **Issue**: Miscommunication during the handoff from the Customer-Front Agent to the Storefront Sub-Agent.\n   - **Solution**: Follow the established handoff pattern strictly, ensuring that the Customer-Front Agent correctly transfers the request and that the sub-agent properly owns and executes the request.\n4. **Approval Workflow**:\n   - **Issue**: Delays in the human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval process for write operations.\n   - **Solution**: Clearly define which operations require HITL approval and streamline the approval process to minimize delays. Ensure that operators are trained to review and approve requests efficiently.\n5. **Security and Compliance**:\n   - **Issue**: Potential exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in responses.\n   - **Solution**: Implement the PII Broker to enforce redaction of sensitive information in public replies. Ensure that all agents are aware of the security protocols regarding PII handling.\n6. **Branching and Version Control**:\n   - **Issue**: Conflicts arising from multiple agents working on the same branch.\n   - **Solution**: Adhere to the daily branching model where all agents commit to a single branch coordinated by the manager. Regularly communicate about changes to avoid conflicts.\n7. **Documentation and Training**:\n   - **Issue**: Outdated training data leading to implementation errors.\n   - **Solution**: Pull the latest documentation from the MCP tools before starting any coding work. Regularly review and update training materials to reflect current practices and tools.\nBy addressing these common issues with the outlined solutions, the implementation of the Wire Storefront Sub-Agent can be more effective and streamlined.",

      "answer": "The Wire Storefront Sub-Agent integrates with the Growth Engine architecture by functioning as a read-only component that handles specific requests related to inventory queries, product details, and collection lookups. It operates under the orchestration of the Customer-Front Agent, which triages customer inquiries and decides whether to transfer the request to the Storefront Sub-Agent or the Accounts Sub-Agent. The Storefront Sub-Agent executes queries using the Storefront API and returns structured JSON data, which is then composed into a reply by the Customer-Front Agent, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations through the PII Broker system. This integration is part of a broader interactive agent architecture that emphasizes real-time responses and operator involvement in the approval process, with no background polling loops involved [Source 1][Source 2].",
