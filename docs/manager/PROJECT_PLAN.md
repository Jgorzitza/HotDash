# PROJECT_PLAN ‚Äî Manager Gates, Milestones, and Rituals (v2)

**File:** `docs/manager/PROJECT_PLAN.md`  
**Canonical strategy:** `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`  
**Execution model:** `docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md`  
**Spec (approvals UI + contracts):** `docs/specs/approvals_drawer_spec.md`

> This is the manager‚Äôs **tactical** playbook. The Operating Model explains _how the system works overall_; this file tells you _exactly what to do, in what order, with what artifacts_, and how gates are enforced in CI.

---

## 0) Roles & Defaults

- **Owner:** Manager (final accountability)
- **Gate approvers:** Manager + domain lead (e.g., engineer for code, integrations for tools)
- **Timeboxes:** Molecule-sized tasks (‚â§ 2 days each)
- **Where work lives:** GitHub Issues (Task form), PRs, and the Approvals Drawer for runtime changes

---

## 1) Gate Framework ‚Äî Entry/Exit Criteria & Artifacts

Each task/PR must pass **all four gates**. Danger/CI enforces parts automatically.

### Gate 1 ‚Äî **Scope**

**Entry:** Issue created (Task form), agent assigned.  
**Exit:** Problem framed, acceptance criteria defined, sandbox set.

**Artifacts required**

- Issue body contains:
  - **Problem statement** (1‚Äì3 sentences)
  - **Acceptance criteria** (bullet list)
  - **Allowed paths** (fnmatch patterns; e.g., `app/** packages/shared/**`)
  - **Risk notes** (known risks, data shape unknowns)

**Automation checks**

- Danger fails PRs without `Fixes #<issue>` or **Allowed paths** in body.
- PR diffs must be within Allowed paths.

---

### Gate 2 ‚Äî **Design**

**Entry:** Scope gate passed.  
**Exit:** Interfaces clear, data flow mapped, failures planned.

**Artifacts required**

- PR description includes a **Design sketch** (can be text/mermaid):
  - Interfaces (functions/routes/schemas)
  - Data flow (where data comes from; tool calls)
  - Failure modes + fallback/timeout strategy
- If UI: screenshot or quick loom/gif; component contracts
- **Tool list** (MCP/SDK) that will be used (no freehand APIs)

**Automation checks**

- If app code changed, Danger warns if no tests changed.
- For tool adapters, stub tests must exist (unit or integration).

---

### Gate 3 ‚Äî **Evidence**

**Entry:** Design gate passed.  
**Exit:** Evidence proves the change works and is safe to ship.

**Artifacts required**

- **Tests**: unit + (where meaningful) integration; E2E if user-visible
- **Metrics/logs**: demo evidence (before/after or sample logs)
- **Approvals (if runtime change)**: an item in Approvals Drawer with evidence & rollback

**Automation checks**

- CI green (Docs Policy, Gitleaks, Danger, AI config)
- If runtime: `/validate` succeeds for the approval‚Äôs actions

---

### Gate 4 ‚Äî **Ship**

**Entry:** Evidence gate passed.  
**Exit:** Change merged (or applied) with rollback & audit trail.

**Artifacts required**

- **Rollback plan** in PR/approval
- **Changelog** entry (if user-facing)
- **Receipts** for applied actions (tool IDs/timestamps)

**Automation checks**

- Required checks passing on `main`
- Secret scanning push protection on

---

## 4) CI/Danger Enforcement Matrix

| Gate     | Check                                               | Enforced by        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Scope    | Issue linked (`Fixes #123`)                         | Danger             |
| Scope    | Allowed paths present & respected                   | Danger             |
| Design   | Tests present if app code changed                   | Danger (warn)      |
| Evidence | CI green (Docs Policy, Gitleaks, Danger, AI config) | GitHub Actions     |
| Evidence | Approval `/validate` OK (runtime)                   | API + UI pre‚Äëcheck |
| Ship     | Required checks on `main`                           | Branch protection  |
| Ship     | Secret scanning & push protection                   | Repo settings      |

## 5) Progress Tracker (lightweight)

Add this table to the top comment of your Milestone Issue and update daily:

| Task                   | Agent        |       Gate | Status | Blocker                     | ETA        |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ---------: | ------ | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Build Approvals Drawer | engineer     | 3/Evidence | üî∂     | Awaiting `/validate` fix    | 2025‚Äë10‚Äë18 |
| Inventory ROP RPC      | integrations |   2/Design | üî∑     | Need variant metafield spec | 2025‚Äë10‚Äë17 |

Legend: üî∑ = in progress, üî∂ = needs review, ‚úÖ = done, ‚õî = blocked

---

## 6) ‚ÄúStop the Line‚Äù Rules

- Secrets detected? **Stop.** Rotate, purge history, re‚Äërun scans, then resume.
- Rogue `.md` in PR? **Stop.** Quarantine and fix the Task setup (Allowed paths).
- Failing `/validate` for runtime actions? **Stop.** Fix tool payloads or scopes before approving.

---

## 7) Manager One‚ÄëCommand Walkthrough (reference)

> Run these locally to sanity check before asking for review.

```bash
# Docs & AI config policies
node scripts/policy/check-docs.mjs
node scripts/policy/check-ai-config.mjs

# Secrets scan (HEAD)
gitleaks detect --source . --redact

# Weekly (history) ‚Äî optional before retro
gitleaks git -v --redact --report-format sarif --report-path .reports/gitleaks-history.sarif --log-opts="--all" .

# Planning TTL sweep
node scripts/ops/archive-docs.mjs
```

---

## 8) RACI (who does what)

- **Manager:** Owns NORTH_STAR, RULES, directions, approvals policy; gate approvals; merges.
- **Engineer:** Implements UI & app code; writes tests; produces evidence.
- **Integrations:** Implements tool adapters (Shopify/Supabase/Chatwoot/Publer).
- **QA:** Designs acceptance checks; verifies `/validate` and receipts.
- **AI (customer):** Drafts; never sends; requires HITL.
- **DevOps:** CI, rulesets, push protection, secret scanning.

| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --- | -------------- |
| GitHub Actions billing issue        | **CRITICAL** | Blocks CI/CD, staging deploy, branch protection | Manager        | 0h  | Oct 17 AM      |
| Supabase migration history mismatch | **CRITICAL** | Blocks staging database sync, RLS testing       | Manager + Data | 0h  | Oct 17 AM      |
| Secrets configuration pending       | MEDIUM       | Blocks workflow testing                         | Manager        | 0h  | Oct 17 AM      |

**Blocker Details:**

**1. GitHub Actions Billing Issue (CRITICAL)**

- **Error:** "The job was not started because recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased"
- **Impact:** Cannot run CI workflows, trigger deployments, verify branch protection, test secrets
- **Required Action:** Manager must resolve in GitHub account settings
- **Affected:** Tasks 2, 3, 4 in partner_dry_run_readiness.md

**2. Supabase Migration History Mismatch (CRITICAL)**

- **Issue:** Remote has 53 migrations not in local directory (Oct 3-14), Local has 40 migrations not on remote (Oct 10-16)
- **Impact:** Cannot safely push migrations to staging database
- **Required Action:** Manager + Data agent coordination on migration strategy
- **Options:** Pull remote schema (safer), Repair migration history (riskier), Manual reconciliation (safest but time-consuming)

**3. Secrets Configuration Pending (MEDIUM)**

- **Required:** 15 secrets (Supabase: 5, Publer: 2, Shopify: 4, Notifications: 3, Fly.io: 1)
- **Impact:** Cannot test workflows requiring secrets
- **Required Action:** Manager to configure GitHub Secrets
- **Status:** Verification script ready (scripts/verify_secrets.sh)

| Sprint-lock deadline missed (Oct 19) | MED        | Delays Partner dry-run    | Resolve blockers by EOD Oct 17, daily status updates              | Manager          |
| Migration data loss                  | LOW        | Critical data corruption  | Use pull remote schema (safest option), test on staging first     | Data + Manager   |
| CI/CD pipeline untested              | HIGH       | Unknown deployment issues | Resolve billing immediately, manual testing as fallback           | DevOps + Manager |
| Secrets exposure during config       | LOW        | Security incident         | Use GitHub Secrets UI only, verify with scripts/verify_secrets.sh | Manager          |

#### Deadline Risk Assessment

**Deadline Risk Score:** 7 (MEDIUM)

- Active blockers: 3 √ó 2 = 6
- Critical path delay: 0 hours / 4 = 0
- Gates incomplete: 5 √ó 3 = 15
- **Total:** (6 + 0 + 15) / 3 = 7

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (5-9)
**Action:** Resolve critical blockers by EOD Oct 17 to reduce risk to LOW
