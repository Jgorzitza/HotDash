# Security Incident Report: Sensitive Data Exposure
Incident ID: SEC-2025-10-11-01
Date: 2025-10-11
Time: 07:18:22Z
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Severity: HIGH

## Summary
During overnight task planning, sensitive data was discovered in plain text within direction and feedback files. This included database URLs, API keys, and email addresses.

## Impact
- Potential exposure of credentials in:
  - Direction documents
  - Feedback files
  - Migration files
  - Runbooks and specs

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. Created security cleanup scripts:
   - /scripts/security/cleanup.sh
   - /scripts/security/sanitize_repo.sh
2. Created security policies:
   - /docs/security/secure_logging_policy.md
   - /docs/security/credentials_policy.md
3. Implemented data redaction patterns
4. Added backup mechanisms for affected files

## Required Actions
1. [ ] Execute cleanup scripts
2. [ ] Review and rotate all exposed credentials
3. [ ] Validate cleanup effectiveness
4. [ ] Update all affected services with new credentials
5. [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks for credential detection
6. [ ] Train team on new security policies

## Prevention Measures
1. Added credential detection patterns
2. Implemented secure logging policy
3. Created credentials management policy
4. Added pre-commit validation
5. Enhanced CI security checks

## Affected Components
- Database credentials
- API keys
- Service URLs
- Email addresses
- Environment variables

## Response Team
- Security Lead: Reliability Team (primary)
- DevOps: Engineer Team (secret migration)
- Engineering: Data Team (database credentials)
- Compliance: QA Team (validation)

## Timeline
- 07:18:22Z: Initial discovery
- 07:20:00Z: Created cleanup scripts and policies
- 07:30:00Z: Notified all agents
- 07:31:00Z: Teams pivoting to security response
- 08:00:00Z: Expected vault migration start
- 10:00:00Z: Target completion for all rotations

## Lessons Learned
1. Enhanced credential scanning needed in CI
2. Automated secret detection required
3. Regular security audits necessary
4. Improved logging standards required

## Next Steps
1. Complete credential rotation
2. Validate all systems operational
3. Update security training
4. Enhance monitoring

## Sign-off
- [ ] Security Lead
- [ ] Engineering Lead
- [ ] Compliance Officer
- [ ] CTO
