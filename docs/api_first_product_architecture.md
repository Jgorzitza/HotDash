## API Design Principles

### RESTful + GraphQL Hybrid
- REST for simple CRUD operations
- GraphQL for complex queries (dashboard data, metrics)
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Versioning Strategy
- `/api/v1/` for current stable
- `/api/v2/` when breaking changes needed
- Support v1 for 12 months after v2 launch

### Authentication
- API keys for server-to-server
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party apps
- JWT tokens for user sessions
