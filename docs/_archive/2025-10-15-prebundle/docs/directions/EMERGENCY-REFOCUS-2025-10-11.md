# EMERGENCY REFOCUS - Launch Critical Work Only

**Date**: 2025-10-11T22:50Z  
**CEO Decision**: Option 1 - Emergency Refocus  
**Goal**: Ship usable tool in 48-72 hours

## North Star Realignment

**Mission**: Deliver a trustworthy, operator-first control center embedded inside Shopify Admin that unifies CX, sales, SEO/content, social, and inventory into actionable tiles with agent-assisted approvals.

**Current Reality**: We drifted into post-launch planning. Refocusing on SHIPPING.

## Launch Gates (Must Complete)

1. ✅ Shopify integration fixed (COMPLETE)
2. ⏳ Agent SDK implemented and tested
3. ⏳ LlamaIndex RAG MCP deployed
4. ⏳ Approval queue UI built
5. ⏳ Webhook endpoints live
6. ⏳ Operator training complete (basics)
7. ⏳ One tile working end-to-end with agent approval

**Target**: 7/7 gates complete in 48-72 hours
