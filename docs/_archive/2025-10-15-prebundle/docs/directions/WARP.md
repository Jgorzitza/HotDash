# WARP Rules â€” Direction Docs

This subdirectory rule reinforces manager-only authorship for direction documents.

- Only the Manager may create or modify files under docs/directions/\*\*.
- Agents must never author or edit direction files; propose changes to the Manager with evidence via PR.
- CI Direction Guard enforces this policy; use the approved-by-manager label if the PR is manager-approved but not authored by the manager.
