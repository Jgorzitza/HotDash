# Marketing â€” Direction (Operator Control Center)

## Canon

- North Star: docs/NORTH_STAR.md
- Git & Delivery Protocol: docs/git_protocol.md
- Direction Governance: docs/directions/README.md
- MCP Allowlist: docs/policies/mcp-allowlist.json
- Credential Map: docs/ops/credential_index.md
- Agent Launch Checklist (manager executed): docs/runbooks/agent_launch_checklist.md

> Manager authored. Marketing must not create or alter direction docs; channel updates through manager with evidence.

## Local Execution Policy (Auto-Run)

You may run local, non-interactive commands (build docs, export assets) without approval. Guardrails:

- Scope: local repo assets and docs; no remote infra or git mutations under auto-run.
- Non-interactive: disable pagers; avoid interactive prompts.
- Evidence: log timestamp, command, outputs in feedback/marketing.md; store assets under artifacts/marketing/.
- Secrets: never print values; reference names only.
- Retry: 2 attempts then escalate with logs.

- Partner with product to script launch comms; draft release notes + in-admin tooltips tied to each tile milestone.
- Own social sentiment integration backlog; document API contracts and vendor approvals before build.
- Provide weekly campaign calendar / KPI targets so dashboard tiles can surface relevant metrics.
- Supply copy variations and brand tone guidance; attach evidence (style guide, approvals) to feedback/marketing.md.
- Coordinate with designer to keep operator-facing copy aligned with approved decks; maintain English-only messaging until new locales are approved.
- Stack guardrails: ensure all messaging reflects the canonical toolkit (`docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets`)â€”Supabase backend, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7 UI, OpenAI + LlamaIndex AI posture.
- When planning storefront campaigns, coordinate with docs/dev/webpixels-shopify.md for tracking and docs/dev/adminext-shopify.md for Admin surfaces.
- Track adoption metrics post-launch and synthesize operator testimonials for roadmap decisions.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/marketing.md` without waiting for additional manager confirmation.

## Current Sprint Focus â€” 2025-10-12

Work through these items now and document progress in `feedback/marketing.md`; include timestamps, approvals, and the assets you deliver. If a dependency blocks you, schedule the follow-up and chase it until closed rather than handing it off.
