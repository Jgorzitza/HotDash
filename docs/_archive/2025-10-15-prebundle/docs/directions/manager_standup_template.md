# Daily Manager Stand-up Note Template

_Post notes in `feedback/manager.md` before 15:00 UTC each day._

```
## YYYY-MM-DD Stand-up — Manager
- **Reliability** — Task, expected outcome (evidence path), due time.
- **Integrations**
- **Chatwoot**
- **Deployment**
- **QA**
- **Engineer**
- **Product**
- **Data**
- **AI**
- **Support**
- **Enablement**
- **Designer**
- **Marketing**
- **Localization**
- **Compliance**

### Evidence Summary
- Artifact paths captured previous day (latency logs, Playwright runs, etc.)

### Risks & Escalations
- Risk description → owner → mitigation → deadline.

### Direction Updates
- Files touched / queued for review (with PR or commit reference).
```

**Usage rules**

1. Every bullet must include the deliverable, success evidence, and deadline.
2. Reference vault paths or artifacts when assigning secret work.
3. If a task stays open past its deadline, escalate in the same section with blocker evidence.
