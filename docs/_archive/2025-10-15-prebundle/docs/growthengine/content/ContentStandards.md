# Content Standards (Helpful, Reliable, People-First)

- **Purpose:** every page/answer must solve a concrete builder job.
- **Originality:** include unique tables, diagrams, or photos from real builds.
- **Attribution:** cite sources when using standards/specs.
- **Safety:** call out torque specs, flammability, and PPE where appropriate.
- **Transparency:** author/byline, updated date, and contact for corrections.
- **Prohibited:** vague, keyword-stuffed text; unverified claims; deprecated FAQ chasing.
