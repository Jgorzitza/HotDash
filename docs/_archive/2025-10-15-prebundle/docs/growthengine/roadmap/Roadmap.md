# 90-Day Roadmap

## Phase 1 (Weeks 0–2): Data Rails

- GSC export ingest; GA4 pulls; Shopify webhooks; Chatwoot webhook.

**Exit:** Actions visible with drafts and evidence; manual execution works.

## Phase 2 (Weeks 2–5): Programmatic Factory

- Metaobjects defined; template rendering; first 20 pages ship.
- Product/Merchant structured data; internal linker.

**Exit:** At least 20 long-tail pages live; CTR Fixer producing daily drafts.

## Phase 3 (Weeks 5–8): Guided Selling & Playbooks

- Chatwoot drafts; inventory playbooks (stock-out/slow-mover/back-in-stock).
- Performance Repair actions wired.

**Exit:** One-click chat replies; banners/badges publishable from Action cards.

## Phase 4 (Weeks 8–12): Learning & Experiments

- Edit-diff logging; basic uplift estimator; A/B flagging and GA4 logging.
- Confidence gating for low-risk auto-publish.

**Exit:** Some changes ship automatically; measured CTR/attach-rate lifts visible.
