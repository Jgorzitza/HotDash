## Vendor Relationship Best Practices

### Communication

**Regular Touchpoints:**
- Monthly: Review vendor performance internally
- Quarterly: Reach out to vendor (if account manager assigned)
- Annually: Schedule QBR with key vendors

**Feedback Loop:**
- Share positive feedback (builds relationship)
- Report issues promptly and professionally
- Document all interactions (ticket numbers, dates)

---

### Cost Optimization

**Strategies:**
1. **Right-size usage:** Monitor quotas, don't over-provision
2. **Negotiate discounts:** Annual commitments, non-profit status
3. **Consolidate vendors:** Fewer vendors = less overhead
4. **Review alternatives:** Periodically (every 2 years)
5. **Optimize API calls:** Cache results, batch requests

**Current Spend:**
- Shopify: $0 (included with merchant)
- Fly.io (Chatwoot): $20/month
- Google: $0 (free tier)
- OpenAI: $50-100/month
- Supabase: $25-50/month
- **Total:** ~$100-170/month

**Projected Spend (12 months):**
- Shopify: $0
- Fly.io: $20-40/month (scaling)
- Google: $0-50/month (if Vertex AI added)
- OpenAI: $100-300/month (usage growth)
- Supabase: $50-100/month (usage growth)
- Hootsuite: $0-99/month (if approved)
- **Total:** ~$170-589/month (~$2,000-7,000/year)

## Vendor Risk Management

### Risk Assessment

**Per Vendor:**
| Vendor | Service Criticality | Lock-in Risk | Availability Risk | Cost Risk | Overall Risk |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Shopify | HIGH | HIGH | LOW | LOW | MEDIUM |
| Chatwoot | MEDIUM | LOW (self-hosted) | MEDIUM | LOW | LOW |
| Google | LOW | LOW | LOW | LOW | LOW |
| OpenAI | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM |
| Supabase | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | LOW | MEDIUM |

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Service Criticality:** Build fallbacks for critical services
- **Lock-in Risk:** Use open standards where possible (GraphQL, REST)
- **Availability Risk:** Implement retry logic, circuit breakers
- **Cost Risk:** Monitor usage, set budget alerts

---

### Contingency Plans

**Shopify Outage:**
- Impact: Dashboard unusable (no order/product data)
- Mitigation: Cache recent data (TTL: 1 hour)
- Fallback: Display cached data with warning banner
- Recovery: Automatic (retry when Shopify recovers)

**Chatwoot Outage:**
- Impact: Support ticket ingestion paused
- Mitigation: Webhook retries (exponential backoff)
- Fallback: Queue messages in Supabase for later processing
- Recovery: Process queued messages when service recovers

**OpenAI Outage:**
- Impact: AI-generated drafts unavailable
- Mitigation: Retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback: Show operators manual template selection
- Recovery: Automatic (retry when OpenAI recovers)

**Supabase Outage:**
- Impact: Complete dashboard failure (database unavailable)
- Mitigation: Supabase has 99.9% SLA, rare occurrence
- Fallback: Display maintenance page
- Recovery: Wait for Supabase recovery (monitor status page)
