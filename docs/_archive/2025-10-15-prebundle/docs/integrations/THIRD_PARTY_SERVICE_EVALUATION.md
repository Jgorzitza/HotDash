- [ ] SDK availability (official TypeScript?)
- [ ] Webhook support (HMAC signatures?)
- [ ] Rate limits documented
- [ ] Uptime SLA published
- [ ] Breaking change policy
- [ ] Deprecation timeline (how much notice?)

**Security Diligence:**
- [ ] SOC 2 Type II certified
- [ ] GDPR compliant
- [ ] Data Processing Agreement (DPA) available
- [ ] Subprocessor list published
- [ ] Security incident notification policy
- [ ] Data retention policies clear
- [ ] Data deletion procedures documented

## Integration Maintenance Burden

### Ongoing Costs Per Integration

**Time Investment:**
- API changes: ~4 hours/quarter (monitor changelogs)
- Security updates: ~2 hours/quarter (rotate keys)
- Bug fixes: ~6 hours/quarter (handle edge cases)
- Testing: ~2 hours/quarter (regression testing)

**Total Per Integration:** ~14 hours/quarter (~1 hour/week)

**Current Integrations:** 4 active + 1 POC = 5 √ó 14h = 70 hours/quarter

**Maximum Sustainable:** ~10 integrations (~140 hours/quarter, ~1 FTE)

**Recommendation:** Be selective - each integration has ongoing cost

---

## Decision Framework

### Should We Integrate?

**Ask:**
1. **Is there a clear business need?** (specific feature/metric)
2. **Can we build it ourselves in same time?** (buy vs. build)
3. **Is the vendor stable and trustworthy?** (1+ year track record)
4. **Do we have capacity to maintain?** (ongoing updates)
5. **Is the cost justified?** (ROI calculation)

**Proceed If:**
- ‚úÖ Business need is documented (Product approval)
- ‚úÖ Vendor passes security/compliance review
- ‚úÖ Cost is acceptable (< $500/month or justified)
- ‚úÖ Integration effort < 40 hours
- ‚úÖ Team has capacity (< 10 active integrations)

**Reject If:**
- ‚ùå Need is speculative (no clear use case)
- ‚ùå Can build ourselves in similar time
- ‚ùå Vendor is unstable or new
- ‚ùå Costs are high without clear ROI
- ‚ùå Team is at capacity

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. ‚úÖ Complete Hootsuite POC contract negotiation
2. ‚è≥ Evaluate Slack incoming webhooks (quick win)
3. ‚è≥ Document decision criteria for future integrations

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. ‚è≥ If Hootsuite approved: Implement social sentiment tile
2. ‚è≥ If Slack approved: Add critical alerts
3. ‚è≥ Review integration maintenance burden (quarterly)

### Medium-term (Q1 2026)
1. ‚è≥ Revisit Stripe (if payment features planned)
2. ‚è≥ Revisit Klaviyo (if marketing analytics expands)
3. ‚è≥ Evaluate Chatwoot vs. Intercom (based on 6 months data)

### Long-term (Q2+ 2026)
1. ‚è≥ Consider advanced BI tools if HotDash outgrows built-in analytics
2. ‚è≥ Reevaluate native social APIs based on Hootsuite costs

---

## Integration Portfolio Strategy

### Maintain Balance

**Core Integrations (Must-Have):**
- Shopify (e-commerce data source)
- Customer support tool (Chatwoot or Intercom)
- Analytics (Google Analytics)
- AI (OpenAI + LlamaIndex)

**Enhancement Integrations (Nice-to-Have):**
- Email marketing (Klaviyo)
- Social sentiment (Hootsuite)
- Payments (Stripe, if needed)
- Notifications (Slack)

**Avoid Over-Integration:**
- Don't integrate for integration's sake
- Each integration needs clear business case
- Consider ongoing maintenance burden
- Prefer fewer, deeper integrations over many shallow ones

---

## Success Criteria

### Integration is Successful If:
- ‚úÖ Used daily by operations team
- ‚úÖ Provides unique value (not duplicating existing data)
- ‚úÖ Uptime > 99% (reliable)
- ‚úÖ Maintenance < 2 hours/month
- ‚úÖ Positive ROI (value > cost + maintenance)

### Integration Should Be Removed If:
- ‚ùå Not used for 30 days
- ‚ùå Costs exceed value
- ‚ùå Maintenance burden > 4 hours/month
- ‚ùå Vendor reliability < 95%
- ‚ùå Better alternative becomes available

---

**Evaluation Complete:** 2025-10-11 21:48 UTC  
**Recommendations:** Focus on Hootsuite POC + Slack quick win  
**Next Review:** Quarterly (or when new requirements emerge)  
**Owner:** Integrations (evaluation), Product (approval), Compliance (vendor review)
