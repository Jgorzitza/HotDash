## âœ… TASKS BL-BP: Conversation AI Enhancement (5/5 COMPLETE)

### Task BL: Conversation Context Management

**Design:** Intelligent context preservation and retrieval across conversation sessions

**Context Layers:**

1. **Immediate Context:** Current conversation messages
2. **Historical Context:** Previous conversations with same customer
3. **Order Context:** Related orders, purchases, returns
4. **Product Context:** Products discussed or purchased
5. **Relationship Context:** Customer lifetime value, segment, preferences

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface ConversationContext {
  current: {
    conversation_id: number;
    messages: Message[];
    customer: Customer;
    inbox: Inbox;
  };
  historical: {
    previous_conversations: Conversation[];
    total_interactions: number;
    avg_satisfaction: number;
    common_topics: string[];
  };
  order: {
    recent_orders: Order[];
    pending_returns: Return[];
    lifetime_value: number;
  };
  product: {
    viewed_products: Product[];
    purchased_products: Product[];
    wishlist: Product[];
  };
  relationship: {
    customer_since: Date;
    segment: "vip" | "loyal" | "standard" | "at_risk";
    preferred_channel: string;
    timezone: string;
  };
}
```

**Context Retrieval:** Auto-loaded when conversation opens, passed to Agent SDK for informed draft generation

**Reference:** Extends data sync from Task J

---

### Task BM: Conversation Memory and Recall

**Design:** Long-term memory system for conversations

**Memory Types:**

1. **Customer Preferences:** "Prefers email over chat", "Don't call before 10 AM"
2. **Issue History:** "Had sizing issue with product X last month"
3. **Resolution Patterns:** "Responds well to detailed explanations"
4. **Product Interests:** "Interested in sustainable fabrics"
5. **Communication Style:** "Prefers formal tone", "Likes emojis"

**Storage:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_memory (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  memory_type TEXT CHECK (memory_type IN ('preference', 'issue_history', 'pattern', 'interest', 'style')),
  memory_content TEXT NOT NULL,
  confidence DECIMAL(3,2), -- How confident we are in this memory
  first_observed TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  last_confirmed TIMESTAMPTZ,
  expiry_date TIMESTAMPTZ, -- Some memories expire
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

**Usage:** Agent SDK includes relevant memories in draft: "I remember you mentioned preferring eco-friendly options..."

---

### Task BN: Conversation Branching Logic

**Design:** Handle multi-issue conversations with branching threads

**Branching Scenarios:**

1. Customer asks multiple unrelated questions
2. New issue emerges during resolution
3. Follow-up on previous conversation while discussing new topic
4. Escalation creates sub-conversation

**Logic:**

```typescript
function detectConversationBranch(messages: Message[]): Branch[] {
  // Detect topic shifts
  const topics = messages.map((m) => detectTopic(m.content));
  const branches = [];

  let current_topic = topics[0];
  let branch_start = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < topics.length; i++) {
    if (
      topics[i] !== current_topic &&
      topicDistance(topics[i], current_topic) > 0.6
    ) {
      // New branch detected
      branches.push({
        topic: current_topic,
        messages: messages.slice(branch_start, i),
        status: "ongoing",
      });
      current_topic = topics[i];
      branch_start = i;
    }
  }

  return branches;
}
```

**UI:** Show branches as tabs or accordion, allow operators to address each separately

---

### Task BO: Emotion Detection

**Design:** Fine-grained emotion detection beyond basic sentiment

**Emotions Detected:**

- Joy, Satisfaction, Gratitude, Relief
- Frustration, Disappointment, Confusion
- Anger, Outrage, Betrayal
- Anxiety, Worry, Urgency
- Excitement, Anticipation

**Implementation:** Already covered in sentiment analysis (Tasks O, AU) - emotion detection is subset

**Enhancement:** Multi-label emotion classification (customer can be both frustrated AND anxious)

---

### Task BP: Intent Classification

**Design:** Precise intent detection for accurate routing

**Intent Taxonomy:**

```typescript
const INTENT_HIERARCHY = {
  transactional: {
    order_status: ["tracking", "delivery_estimate", "order_confirmation"],
    returns: ["initiate_return", "return_status", "refund_inquiry"],
    exchanges: ["size_exchange", "color_exchange", "product_exchange"],
    modifications: ["cancel_order", "change_address", "update_payment"],
  },
  informational: {
    product: ["specs", "availability", "pricing", "recommendations"],
    policy: ["shipping", "returns", "warranty", "privacy"],
    account: ["login_help", "password_reset", "update_info"],
    general: ["store_hours", "contact_info", "about_company"],
  },
  problem_solving: {
    technical: ["website_error", "checkout_issue", "account_access"],
    quality: ["damaged_product", "wrong_item", "missing_item"],
    billing: ["incorrect_charge", "payment_failed", "refund_delay"],
    delivery: ["lost_package", "delayed_shipment", "wrong_address"],
