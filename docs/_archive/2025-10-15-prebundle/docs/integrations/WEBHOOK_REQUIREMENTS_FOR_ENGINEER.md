# Webhook Configuration Requirements for Engineer (Task 2 Spec)

**Date:** 2025-10-11T22:32:36Z  
**Purpose:** Document webhook endpoint requirements so Task 2 can proceed once endpoint is deployed  
**Status:** SPEC COMPLETE - Ready for Engineer Implementation

---

## üéØ TASK 2 WORKAROUND (Per Manager Blocker Management)

Per manager direction: "For Task 2, create webhook spec document showing what you need from Engineer, then move on."

This document provides **complete specifications** for the webhook endpoint so Task 2 can be executed immediately once the endpoint is deployed.

---

## WEBHOOK ENDPOINT SPECIFICATIONS

### Required Endpoint

**URL:** `https://hotdash-agent-service.fly.dev/webhooks/chatwoot`  
**Method:** POST  
**Content-Type:** application/json  
**Authentication:** HMAC-SHA256 signature in `X-Chatwoot-Signature` header

---

### Webhook Configuration in Chatwoot

**When Engineer Confirms Deployment, Execute:**

1. **Log in to Chatwoot:**
   - URL: https://hotdash-chatwoot.fly.dev
   - Credentials: From `vault/occ/chatwoot/super_admin_staging.env`

2. **Navigate to Webhooks:**
   - Settings (gear icon) ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks

3. **Add Webhook:**

   ```
   Endpoint URL: https://hotdash-agent-service.fly.dev/webhooks/chatwoot
   Description: Agent SDK Message Processing
   Events to Subscribe:
     ‚úÖ message_created (PRIMARY)
     ‚ö†Ô∏è  conversation_created (OPTIONAL)
     ‚ö†Ô∏è  conversation_status_changed (OPTIONAL for cleanup)

   Webhook Secret: [OBTAIN FROM ENGINEER]
   ```

4. **Test Webhook:**
   - Click "Test Webhook" button in Chatwoot
   - Verify endpoint receives payload
   - Check logs for successful processing
   - Confirm 200 OK response

5. **Verify Signature:**

   ```bash
   # Use our verification script
   npx ts-node --esm scripts/ops/verify-chatwoot-webhook.ts \
     --generate test-payload.json <webhook_secret>
   ```

6. **Document Results:**
   - Screenshot of webhook configuration
   - Test payload logs
   - Signature verification results
   - Save to: `artifacts/chatwoot/webhook-config-TIMESTAMP/`

### Engineer Deliverables Needed

**Before Task 2 Can Execute:**

1. ‚úÖ Deploy webhook endpoint to Fly.io
2. ‚úÖ Configure environment variables:
   - `CHATWOOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - `CHATWOOT_API_TOKEN`
   - `CHATWOOT_BASE_URL=https://hotdash-chatwoot.fly.dev`
3. ‚úÖ Test endpoint responds to POST
4. ‚úÖ Share webhook secret with Chatwoot agent
5. ‚úÖ Confirm deployment status

**Webhook Handler Code:** Already provided in `supabase/functions/chatwoot-webhook/index.ts`  
**HMAC Verification:** Already provided in `scripts/ops/verify-chatwoot-webhook.ts`  
**Integration Guide:** Already in `docs/integrations/engineer-handoff-chatwoot.md`

### Expected Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "event": "message_created",
  "account": { "id": 1, "name": "HotDash" },
