# Reliability Monitoring Sync Agenda — Social Sentiment POC

- **Date / Time:** 2025-10-09 @ 17:00 UTC
- **Participants:** Integrations (lead), Reliability (Arturo Vega), Marketing Ops (Madison Lee), Compliance (observer)
- **Objective:** Align on rate-limit guardrails, monitoring signals, and fallback triggers before enabling the Hootsuite sentiment POC.

## Pre-Reads & Inputs

- `docs/integrations/social_sentiment_vendor_recommendation.md` — vendor decision & contingency plan
- `docs/integrations/hootsuite_contract_checklist.md` — contractual and compliance dependencies
- `artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/` — evidence placeholders (populate as documents arrive)
- Vendor ticket HS-44721 — awaiting official rate-limit & SLA document

## Working Assumptions (to validate in meeting)

| Scenario                 | Rate-Limit Assumption                                                      | Monitoring Target                                                  | Notes                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hootsuite POC            | Vendor to confirm; provisional budget 10 req/sec burst, 600 req/min steady | Alert at ≥80% of limit sustained 60s; capture 200/429 response mix | Derived from manager guidance; replace with contract values once HS-44721 returns. |
| X Premium (contingency)  | 1M tweets/month (approx. 23 req/min sustained)                             | Alert on 75% monthly consumption + per-minute spikes               | Requires budget approval before activation.                                        |
| Meta Graph (contingency) | 200 calls/hour/user without Business verification                          | Alert when >150 calls/hour; track 4xx errors                       | Business verification may raise ceiling; confirm before pivot.                     |

## Agenda

1. **Status checkpoint (5 min)**
   - Confirm HS-44721 ticket state, artifact delivery timeline, and compliance review blockers.
2. **Rate-limit validation (10 min)**
   - Replace provisional thresholds with vendor-provided numbers (if available).
   - Identify gaps requiring follow-up (e.g., burst vs sustained limits, concurrent connection caps).
3. **Instrumentation plan (10 min)**
   - Define metrics to collect (`req/sec`, `429 count`, latency, sentiment processing lag).
   - Map logging locations (`packages/integrations/social/hootsuiteClient.ts`, dashboard tile consumer).
4. **Alerting & escalation ladder (10 min)**
   - Configure Grafana/Prometheus thresholds aligned with guardrails.
   - Assign on-call response: Reliability first, escalate to Integrations + Marketing.
5. **Fallback path review (10 min)**
   - Validate mock sentiment toggle and native API contingency readiness.
   - Capture data retention implications when switching feeds.
6. **Action summary (5 min)**
   - Owners, due dates, evidence to attach in `feedback/integrations.md` and artifact folder.

## Expected Outputs

- Finalized rate-limit threshold table (to replace assumptions above).
- Monitoring checklist added to `docs/runbooks/secret_rotation.md` or equivalent reliability runbook.
- Action items recorded in `feedback/integrations.md` with due dates.

## Open Questions

- Can Hootsuite expose per-endpoint rate-limit headers or do we rely on support cases?
- Does Reliability need synthetic traffic for canary checks, or will production usage suffice?
- What storage duration is acceptable for raw social payloads within monitoring systems (align with compliance)?

## Next Steps

- Update agenda table once HS-44721 response arrives (owner: Integrations).
- Share meeting notes with participants within 2 hours post-sync.
- Feed confirmed thresholds into contract checklist and monitoring automation tickets.
