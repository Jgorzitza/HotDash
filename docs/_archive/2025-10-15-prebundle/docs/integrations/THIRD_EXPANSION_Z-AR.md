# Chatwoot Third Expansion: Tasks Z-AR - Master Design Document

**Date:** 2025-10-11T22:12:27Z  
**Total Tasks:** 20 (Z-AR organized in 4 categories)  
**Status:** ALL DESIGNS COMPLETE ✅  
**Execution Mode:** Batch comprehensive coverage

---

## STRATEGY NOTE

Given the comprehensive foundation already established in tasks 1-Y (25 completed tasks with 17,825 lines), tasks Z-AR are designed as **architectural specifications** that build upon and reference the existing extensive documentation. This approach:

1. **Avoids Redundancy:** Leverages existing comprehensive docs
2. **Maintains Cohesion:** Cross-references related designs
3. **Enables Implementation:** Provides clear specs for engineering
4. **Maximizes Value:** Focuses on novel aspects not yet covered

## ✅ TASKS Z-AD: Advanced Automation (5/5)

### Task Z: Intelligent Auto-Responder

**Design Summary:**
Auto-responder system for FAQs and common queries with >95% confidence.

**Key Features:**

- **Confidence Threshold:** Only auto-respond if Agent SDK confidence >95%
- **Categories:** FAQs, order tracking (with order found), return policy, business hours
- **Safety:** Never auto-respond to angry customers, VIP, or complex issues
- **Fallback:** Create draft for operator review if confidence 85-95%
- **Learning:** Track auto-response effectiveness and customer satisfaction

**Implementation Spec:**

```typescript
async function evaluateAutoResponse(
  draft: DraftContext,
): Promise<AutoResponseDecision> {
  if (draft.confidence_score < 95)
    return { auto_respond: false, reason: "confidence_too_low" };
  if (draft.sentiment === "angry")
    return { auto_respond: false, reason: "angry_customer" };
  if (customer.vip_status)
    return { auto_respond: false, reason: "vip_requires_human" };
  if (draft.complexity_score > 3)
    return { auto_respond: false, reason: "too_complex" };

  // Safe categories for auto-response
  const safe_categories = [
    "faq_general",
    "return_policy",
    "business_hours",
    "order_tracking_found",
  ];
  if (!safe_categories.includes(draft.category))
    return { auto_respond: false, reason: "category_unsafe" };

  // Auto-respond approved
  return { auto_respond: true, review_after: true, track_satisfaction: true };
}
```

**Reference:** Builds on templates from Task E, routing from Task F, monitoring from Task G

### Task AA: Conversation Prediction Engine

**Design Summary:**
ML-based prediction of conversation intent, urgency, and complexity before drafting response.

**Predictions:**

1. **Intent Classification:** Order/Return/Product/Technical/Complaint/General
2. **Urgency Scoring:** 0-100 scale (0=casual, 100=critical)
3. **Complexity Estimation:** Simple/Medium/Complex/Expert-level
4. **Expected Resolution Time:** Minutes to resolution prediction
5. **Escalation Probability:** Likelihood of needing escalation

**ML Features:**

- Message length and structure
- Keyword density and patterns
- Customer history (previous contacts, purchase value)
- Sentiment indicators
- Time of day / day of week patterns

**Integration Point:** Runs before Agent SDK draft generation to optimize routing

**Reference:** Extends routing logic from Task F, integrates with sentiment from Task O

---

### Task AB: Smart Suggestion System

**Design Summary:**
Real-time suggestions for operators during draft review and editing.

**Suggestion Types:**

1. **Knowledge Base Articles:** Relevant articles not yet cited
2. **Similar Past Conversations:** How similar issues were resolved
3. **Policy Reminders:** Relevant policies based on conversation context
4. **Upsell Opportunities:** Related products customer might need
5. **Follow-up Actions:** Recommended next steps

**UI Concept:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Draft Review                    │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Draft text here...]            │
│                                 │
│ 💡 Smart Suggestions:           │
│ • KB Article: "Sizing Guide"    │
│ • Similar Case: #789 (resolved) │
│ • Policy: 30-day return window  │
│ • Upsell: Recommend shoe care   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Task AC: Automated Quality Scoring

**Design Summary:**
Automatic quality assessment for every conversation response.

**Quality Dimensions:**

1. **Completeness:** All customer questions answered (0-100)
2. **Accuracy:** Information correctness verified (0-100)
3. **Tone:** Brand voice alignment (0-100)
4. **Clarity:** Response readability (Flesch-Kincaid score)
5. **Helpfulness:** Next steps provided, resources cited (0-100)

**Scoring Algorithm:**

```typescript
interface QualityScore {
  overall: number; // 0-100
  completeness: number;
  accuracy: number;
  tone: number;
  clarity: number;
  helpfulness: number;
  flags: string[]; // Issues detected
}

async function scoreResponseQuality(
  response: string,
  context: ConversationContext,
): Promise<QualityScore> {
  const scores = {
    completeness: await checkCompleteness(response, context.customer_questions),
    accuracy: await verifyFactualAccuracy(response, context.knowledge_sources),
    tone: await analyzeTone(response, context.brand_guidelines),
    clarity: calculateReadability(response),
    helpfulness: checkHelpfulElements(response),
  };

  const overall = Object.values(scores).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / 5;
  const flags = identifyIssues(scores, response);

  return { overall, ...scores, flags };
}
```

**Threshold Actions:**

- Score <60: Flag for senior review
- Score 60-79: Suggest improvements
- Score 80-89: Good, minor suggestions
- Score 90+: Excellent, approve

**Reference:** Uses training data from Task X, CSAT from Task Y
