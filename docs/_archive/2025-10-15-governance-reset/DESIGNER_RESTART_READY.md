## 🚀 Context for Restart

### What Happened This Session

1. Completed minimal approval UI handoff for Engineer
2. Executed 19 parallel/launch-aligned tasks
3. Received North Star correction (DELIVER not PLAN)
4. Refocused on implementation-ready specs
5. All specs delivered, Engineer unblocked

### What to Do After Restart

1. Re-read docs/directions/designer.md
2. Check feedback/engineer.md for implementation status
3. If Engineer completed UI → Execute Task 4 (Implementation Review)
4. If Engineer still building → Stand by
5. Continue checking North Star alignment

### Key Learnings

- ✅ Focus on DELIVERY (working UI) not PLANNING (docs)
- ✅ Check North Star after every 5-10 tasks
- ✅ Flag drift proactively to Manager
- ✅ Minimal specs ship faster than comprehensive specs
- ✅ Polaris-first = zero custom work = faster delivery

## 🔍 Quick Reference

**My Direction**: docs/directions/designer.md
**My Feedback**: feedback/designer.md
**North Star**: docs/NORTH_STAR.md
**Engineer Status**: feedback/engineer.md

**Key Specs for Engineer**:
