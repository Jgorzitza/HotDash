**Date**: 2025-10-12T04:36:00Z  
**Status**: Ready for restart  
**Next Action**: Check for engineer fix to agent-service, then continue monitoring

---

## Current Status Summary

**Session**: Extended work session (2025-10-11 to 2025-10-12)  
**Tasks Completed**: 7/9 executable (78%)  
**Critical Issues Found**: 5 (all escalated with evidence)  
**Documentation**: ~125KB delivered  
**Standing By**: Awaiting engineer fix to agent-service Zod schema error

---

## What Happened This Session

### Major Discovery
üéâ **Engineer deployed Agent SDK services!**
- hotdash-llamaindex-mcp: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- hotdash-agent-service: üö® CRITICAL STARTUP ERROR

### Critical Issue Found (SEV-1)
**Service**: hotdash-agent-service  
**Error**: Zod schema validation failure
```
shopify_cancel_order.reason uses .optional() 
needs .optional().nullable()
```
**Status**: Escalated to engineer with full error logs and fix
**Impact**: Service cannot start, blocks Agent SDK approval queue

### Other Findings
1. health-check.server.ts uses deprecated SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN (escalated to engineer)
2. Chatwoot worker scaled to 1024MB (stable, target 2048MB)
3. Staging DB uses Fly Postgres (canonical violation, escalated to manager)
4. Latency <300ms requires Fly tuning (escalated to deployment)

---

## Tasks Completed (7/9)

‚úÖ **Task 1**: Local Supabase readiness - Verified canonical compliance  
‚úÖ **Task 2**: Agent SDK monitoring - Found critical error, 1/2 operational  
‚úÖ **Task 3**: Latency optimization - Tested, escalated to deployment  
‚úÖ **Task 4**: Chatwoot verification - Operational, 1024MB stable  
‚úÖ **Task 5**: Supabase RLS - 7/7 tables enabled  
‚úÖ **Task 7**: Backup drill - Runbook updated with tested procedures  
‚úÖ **Task C**: Performance baseline - 587ms avg established

‚è≥ **Task 6**: GA MCP readiness - Blocked on credentials  
‚è≥ **Task 8**: Stack compliance audit - Scheduled Monday/Thursday

## Next Actions (When Restarting)

### Immediate (First 5 Minutes)

1. **Check for Engineer Fix**:
```bash
cd ~/HotDash/hot-dash
~/.fly/bin/fly apps list | grep agent
# Look for agent-service status change
```

2. **If Fix Deployed, Run Health Checks**:
```bash
./scripts/ops/agent-sdk-health-check.sh
# Expected: Both services return 200 OK
```

3. **Review Feedback Log**:
```bash
tail -200 feedback/reliability.md
# Catch up on any updates during downtime
```

### If Agent-Service Fixed (30 Minutes)

4. **Verify Health**:
```bash
# Run 10 health checks over 5 minutes
for i in {1..10}; do
  ./scripts/ops/agent-sdk-health-check.sh
  sleep 30
done
```

5. **Check Logs for Errors**:
```bash
./scripts/ops/agent-sdk-logs.sh all errors
# Verify no startup errors
```

6. **Document Fix Verification**:
```bash
# Log results to feedback/reliability.md
echo "[$(date -u)] agent-service fix verified, both services operational" >> feedback/reliability.md
```

### If Still Broken (5 Minutes)

4. **Check Deployment Status**:
```bash
~/.fly/bin/fly releases -a hotdash-agent-service | head -5
```

5. **Review Recent Logs**:
```bash
./scripts/ops/agent-sdk-logs.sh agent-service errors
```

6. **Update Escalation**:
```bash
echo "[$(date -u)] agent-service still broken, awaiting engineer" >> feedback/reliability.md
```

### Ongoing (Daily)

7. **Run Daily Health Checks**:
```bash
./scripts/ops/agent-sdk-health-check.sh
```

8. **Monitor Performance**:
```bash
# Run 2 synthetic checks per day
SYNTHETIC_CHECK_URL="https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0" \
SYNTHETIC_CHECK_BUDGET_MS=800 \
node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs
```

9. **Check for New Direction**:
```bash
tail -50 docs/directions/reliability.md
# Look for updates from manager
```

## Context for Restart

### Where We Are
- **Launch Status**: 5/7 gates complete (per last manager update)
- **Engineer**: Working on Task 6 (Approval Queue UI, 3-4h)
- **My Status**: Standing by for agent-service fix

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ LlamaIndex MCP: Operational
- ‚úÖ Chatwoot: Healthy (web 2048MB, worker 1024MB)
- ‚úÖ Staging app: Healthy (617ms latency)
- ‚úÖ Supabase: All operational
- ‚úÖ Performance baselines: Established

### What's Broken
- üö® agent-service: Zod schema error (engineer fixing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è health-check.server.ts: Deprecated token (engineer to fix)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Staging DB: Canonical violation (manager decision)

### What's Next
1. Verify engineer fix to agent-service
2. Establish usage baselines (24 hours)
3. Set up automated monitoring
4. Continue with GA MCP (when credentials available)
5. Participate in stack compliance audit (when scheduled)

## Self-Assessment Summary

**Executed Very Well** (Continue):
1. Immediate issue detection with actionable fixes ‚≠ê
2. Evidence-based documentation ‚≠ê
3. North Star alignment after correction ‚≠ê
4. Proactive problem solving ‚≠ê

**Needs Improvement** (Fixing):
1. Over-documentation before validation ‚Üí Test first, doc later
2. Insufficient North Star checking ‚Üí Explicit check every task
3. Passive waiting ‚Üí Automate deployment monitoring

**Stop Immediately** (Replacing):
1. Runbooks for non-existent services ‚Üí Simple checklists first
2. Multiple overlapping scripts ‚Üí Consolidate to 1-2 tools

**10X Recommendations** (For CEO):
1. Automated Tile Performance Dashboard (competitive advantage)
2. Operator-Facing Status Page (trust through transparency)
3. Weekly Infrastructure Newsletter (visible improvements, retention)
