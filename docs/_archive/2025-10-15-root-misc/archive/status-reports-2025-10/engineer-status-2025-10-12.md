# Engineer Status Report - 2025-10-12T02:45Z

## üìã UNDERSTANDING CONFIRMED

### ‚úÖ Foundational Documents Reviewed

1. **README.md** - Quick start, MCP tools, daily workflows
2. **NORTH_STAR.md** - MCP-First development, evidence requirement
3. **docs/directions/README.md** - Direction governance, canonical toolkit

### üéØ KEY LEARNINGS INTERNALIZED

**MCP-First Development**:

- ‚úÖ Always verify with MCP tools before implementing
- ‚úÖ Never trust training data for React Router 7 or Shopify APIs
- ‚úÖ Search codebase first (Context7), then verify with appropriate MCP
- ‚úÖ All Shopify queries must be validated with Shopify MCP

**Evidence Requirements**:

- ‚úÖ Every feedback update: timestamp + command + output path
- ‚úÖ Two documented failures before escalation
- ‚úÖ Self-test before requesting QA review

**Canonical Stack**:

- ‚úÖ Supabase (database - single source of truth)
- ‚úÖ React Router 7 (not Remix)
- ‚úÖ Shopify CLI v3 + App Bridge v3
- ‚úÖ No alternate stacks (MySQL/MongoDB/SQLite prohibited)

## üìä CURRENT ASSIGNMENT UNDERSTANDING

### Tasks REASSIGNED to Engineer Helper:

- ‚ùå Task 2: Shopify GraphQL Fixes (Helper owns)
- ‚ùå Task 3: LlamaIndex MCP (Helper owns - QA found 0/3 tools working)

### MY TASKS (4-7):

**Task 4: Agent SDK Service** ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS

- Status: Deployed with credentials from vault
- URL: https://hotdash-agent-service.fly.dev
- Credentials configured: ‚úÖ Shopify, ‚úÖ Chatwoot, ‚úÖ OpenAI
- MISSING: Supabase database URL (need vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env)
- Health check: Unknown (endpoint not responding yet)

**Task 5: Approval Queue UI** ‚è≥ PENDING

- Dependency: Designer specs needed
- Timeline: 3-4 hours once specs available

**Task 6: E2E Integration Test** ‚è≥ PENDING

- Dependency: Tasks 4 & 5 must complete first
- Timeline: 1-2 hours

---

## üö® CURRENT BLOCKER

**Agent SDK Service Health Unknown**

**What I Did**:

1. ‚úÖ Set 5 secrets from vault (Shopify, Chatwoot, OpenAI, LlamaIndex URL)
2. ‚úÖ Deployed: `fly deploy --app hotdash-agent-service`
3. ‚úÖ Deployment succeeded (image: 80 MB)
4. ‚ùå Health check curl returned empty
5. ‚ùå Logs command interrupted

**What's Missing**:

- Supabase database URL secret (direction says: vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env)
- Health endpoint verification
- Service startup confirmation

**Next Steps** (for Helper or me to execute):

1. Add Supabase DB secret: `fly secrets set PG_URL=$(cat vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env | grep DATABASE_URL | cut -d= -f2) --app hotdash-agent-service`
2. Verify health: `curl https://hotdash-agent-service.fly.dev/health`
3. Check logs: `fly logs --app hotdash-agent-service`
4. If still failing, add `/health` route to server.ts

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK TODAY

**Launch Gate Work**:

1. ‚úÖ Task 3 (LlamaIndex MCP) - Deployed before reassignment
2. ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint created (app/routes/api.webhooks.chatwoot.tsx)
3. ‚úÖ TypeScript errors fixed (app/utils/logger.server.ts, handoff-manager.ts)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 4 (Agent SDK) - Deployed, needs health verification

**Non-Launch Work** (deviation):

- 30+ files for Tasks 7-30 (should have been deprioritized per North Star)

---

## üéØ READY TO EXECUTE

**Immediate Actions Available**:

1. Add Supabase secret to Agent SDK
2. Verify Agent SDK health
3. Create health endpoint if missing
4. Wait for Designer specs (Task 5)
5. Execute Task 6 once Tasks 4 & 5 complete

**Blocked On**:

- Agent SDK health verification (Helper can assist)
- Designer specs for Approval UI

**ETA to Complete My Tasks**: 5-8 hours (once Task 4 verified)

---

## üìù FEEDBACK TO MANAGER

**Process Improvement Suggestion**:
When direction contains both "LAUNCH CRITICAL REFOCUS" and "EXPANDED TASK LIST", I should:

1. Flag the apparent conflict in feedback/engineer.md
2. Request confirmation: "Execute launch gates ONLY or include expanded tasks?"
3. Wait for explicit clarification before proceeding

This would have prevented the deviation from North Star.

---

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED - Standing by for:

- Helper assistance with Agent SDK verification
- Updated direction from Manager
- Designer specs for Approval UI

**All work logged in**: feedback/engineer.md with timestamps and commands
