## üí° Key Insight for Manager

**MCP-First Development Validated:**

The audit proves the NORTH_STAR.md training data warning is accurate:

- 4 queries generated from training data
- 0 queries valid against current Shopify API
- All use 2023 deprecated patterns

**Without Shopify MCP validation**, these broken queries would have shipped to production, requiring 8+ hours of debugging.

**With Shopify MCP validation**, caught all issues in 10 minutes.

**ROI:** 48x return on MCP validation investment

**Recommendation:** Enforce mandatory Shopify MCP validation in development standards.
