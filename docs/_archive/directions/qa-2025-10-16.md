Source: docs/directions/qa.md (archived daily objective)

## 15) Today's Objective (2025-10-16) — BLOCKER‑FIRST RESET

Status: ACTIVE
Priority: P0 — Create failing tests to drive unblockers and approvals loop

Work rule: Execute strictly in order. If blocked >10 minutes, log blocker in feedback/qa/<today>.md and move on.

Git Process (Manager‑Controlled)

- No git operations; Manager will create Issues/PRs with Allowed paths/DoD.

Ordered Task List (30)

1. Failing tests for missing Approvals UI (until Engineer restores)
2. Negative tests for /validate errors path
3. Dashboard E2E: await restored tiles and verify loading states
4. Integration tests for Integrations API contracts (when restored)
5. Performance test targeting tile APIs (P95 < 500ms)
6. Security tests for approvals endpoints
7. RLS enforcement tests with Supabase RPC
8. Accessibility tests for Drawer focus traps
9. Screenshot diff tests for tile states
10. Test data generators for demos
11. CI gating on these suites
12. PR review checklists for evidence/rollback
13. Test skip annotations for known blockers
14. Red team tests on AI‑Customer outputs (policy/tone/accuracy)
15. Validate Support RAG build script guard
16. Validate Data migrations apply/rollback locally
17. Validate Integrations rate‑limit/audit middleware
18. Validate Ads calculators with fixtures
19. Validate Inventory services with fixtures
20. Validate SEO modules outputs
21. Validate Content services hooks
22. Validate Analytics loaders respond with mocks
23. Coverage reports per suite
24. Flaky test monitors
25. Parallelism config for CI speed
26. Playwright trace retention on failure
27. Load testing SLOs
28. API contract snapshots
29. Docs linking test IDs to specs
30. Weekly sweep to retire skips

### Artifact Source and Phase 2 — NORTH_STAR Delivery (22 tasks)

Note: Manager will restore UI/API artifacts from docs/\_archive/2025-10-15-prebundle. Agents must not use git. Validate restored behavior with tests.

Phase 2 Tasks:

1. Approvals Drawer A11y test matrix (SR + keyboard)
2. Dashboard tiles visual baselines (3 breakpoints)
3. /validate endpoint negative/edge cases
4. API contract snapshots for all clients
5. Retry/backoff observable assertions
6. Rate-limit behavior tests (Integrations)
7. RLS policy enforcement tests (Data)
8. Ads calculators correctness tests
9. SEO anomalies output consistency tests
10. Inventory ROP/PO generator tests
11. AI‑Customer HITL gating tests
12. Support RAG safety guard tests
13. Analytics loaders fallback tests
14. Content drafter validation tests
15. Performance budgets for tiles
16. Flakiness tracker/report
17. E2E flows with mocked backends
18. PR evidence checker (Danger rule inputs)
19. CI gating on failing suites
20. Test data fixture library expansion
21. Docs linking test IDs → specs
22. Weekly sweep to retire skips
