## 🎯 NEW: Growth Engine Architecture (Effective 2025-10-21)

**Context**: Growth Engine Final Pack integrated into project

### My Responsibilities as Manager

**Agent Orchestration Oversight**:

- **Front-End Agents** (Customer-Front, CEO-Front): Coordinate with AI-Customer agent for production implementation

- **Phase 11**: Bundles-BOM + Attribution + Emergency Sourcing (Integrations, Analytics, Inventory) — 29h total
- **Phase 12**: CX → Product Loop (AI-Knowledge, Product) — 6h total

**See**: `.cursor/rules/10-growth-engine-pack.mdc`, `GROWTH_ENGINE_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md`

---

## 📊 MANDATORY: Progress Reporting (Database Feedback)

**Report progress via `logDecision()` every 2 hours minimum OR at task milestones.**

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { logDecision } from "~/services/decisions.server";

// When starting a task
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "manager",
  taskId: "{TASK-ID}", // Task ID from this direction file
  status: "in_progress", // pending | in_progress | completed | blocked | cancelled
  progressPct: 0, // 0-100 percentage
  action: "task_started",
  rationale: "Starting {task description}",
  evidenceUrl: "docs/directions/manager.md",
  durationEstimate: 4.0, // Estimated hours
});

// Progress update (every 2 hours)
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "manager",
  taskId: "{TASK-ID}",
  status: "in_progress",
  progressPct: 50, // Update progress
  action: "task_progress",
  rationale: "Component implemented, writing tests",
  evidenceUrl: "artifacts/manager/2025-10-22/{task}.md",
  durationActual: 2.0, // Hours spent so far
  nextAction: "Complete integration tests",
});

// When completed
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "manager",
  taskId: "{TASK-ID}",
  status: "completed", // CRITICAL for manager queries
  progressPct: 100,
  action: "task_completed",
  rationale: "{Task name} complete, {X}/{X} tests passing",
  evidenceUrl: "artifacts/manager/2025-10-22/{task}-complete.md",
  durationEstimate: 4.0,
  durationActual: 3.5, // Compare estimate vs actual
  nextAction: "Starting {NEXT-TASK-ID}",
});
```

### When Blocked (CRITICAL)

**Manager queries blocked tasks FIRST during consolidation**:

```typescript
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "manager",
  taskId: "{TASK-ID}",
  status: "blocked", // Manager sees this in query-blocked-tasks.ts
  progressPct: 40,
  blockerDetails: "Waiting for {dependency} to complete",
  blockedBy: "{DEPENDENCY-TASK-ID}", // e.g., 'DATA-017', 'CREDENTIALS-GOOGLE-ADS'
  action: "task_blocked",
  rationale: "Cannot proceed because {reason}",
  evidenceUrl: "feedback/manager/2025-10-22.md",
});
```

### Manager Visibility

Manager runs these scripts to see your work instantly:

- `query-blocked-tasks.ts` - Shows if you're blocked and why
- `query-agent-status.ts` - Shows your current task and progress
- `query-completed-today.ts` - Shows your completed work

**This is why structured logging is MANDATORY** - Manager can see status across all 17 agents in <10 seconds.

### Daily Shutdown (with Self-Grading)

**At end of day, log shutdown with self-assessment**:

```typescript
import { calculateSelfGradeAverage } from "~/services/decisions.server";

const grades = {
  progress: 5, // 1-5: Progress vs DoD
  evidence: 4, // 1-5: Evidence quality
  alignment: 5, // 1-5: Followed North Star/Rules
  toolDiscipline: 5, // 1-5: MCP-first, no guessing
  communication: 4, // 1-5: Clear updates, timely blockers
};

await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "manager",
  action: "shutdown",
  status: "in_progress", // or 'completed' if all tasks done
  progressPct: 75, // Overall daily progress
  rationale: "Daily shutdown - {X} tasks completed, {Y} in progress",
  durationActual: 6.5, // Total hours today
  payload: {
    dailySummary: "{TASK-A} complete, {TASK-B} at 75%",
    selfGrade: {
      ...grades,
      average: calculateSelfGradeAverage(grades),
    },
    retrospective: {
      didWell: ["Used MCP first", "Good test coverage"],
      toChange: ["Ask questions earlier"],
      toStop: "Making assumptions",
    },
    tasksCompleted: ["{TASK-ID-A}", "{TASK-ID-B}"],
    hoursWorked: 6.5,
  },
});
```

### Markdown Backup (Optional)

You can still write to `feedback/manager/2025-10-22.md` for detailed notes, but database is the primary method.

---

## 🚀 ACTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES (Continuous)

### 1. Agent Coordination (Daily - 6h/day)

**Query agent status 3x daily** (< 10 seconds per cycle):

```bash
# Morning (9am): Unblock overnight issues
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-blocked-tasks.ts
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-agent-status.ts

# Midday (1pm): Check progress
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-agent-status.ts
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-completed-today.ts

# Evening (6pm): Review day's work
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-completed-today.ts
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-blocked-tasks.ts
```

**Deep dive**: Only read markdown feedback files for blocked tasks

**Unblock agents <1 hour**:

- Credential requests: Pull from vault, provide immediately
- Technical questions: Use MCP tools to find answers
- Dependency conflicts: Coordinate sequential work
- Never let agent wait idle

**Track Progress**:

- Maintain progress table in feedback/manager/2025-10-21.md
- Update after each feedback review
- Identify lagging agents immediately

**Growth Engine Coordination** (NEW):

- **Phase Dependencies**: Ensure Data completes tables BEFORE Inventory/Integrations start services
- **DevOps First**: Ensure DevOps creates GA4 custom dimension BEFORE Analytics starts attribution
- **Engineer + Designer**: Coordinate PII Card implementation + validation (Phase 9)
- **AI-Knowledge → Product**: Ensure theme handoff works (Phase 12)

---

### 2. CEO Checkpoint Management (After Each Phase)

**After Phase 9 Complete** (PII Card):

1. Engineer finishes ENG-029, 030, 031
2. Designer validates DES-017
3. Present to CEO:
   - Screenshots of PII Card component
   - Demo of CX Escalation Modal split UI
   - PII redaction validation
   - Designer approval
4. CEO approves → Direct Phase 10 work
5. CEO rejects → Direct fixes, retest

**After Phase 10 Complete** (Vendor/ALC):

1. Data finishes DATA-017, 018, 019, 021
2. Inventory finishes INVENTORY-016, 017, 018
3. Integrations finishes INTEGRATIONS-012
4. DevOps finishes DEVOPS-014, 015
5. Present to CEO:
   - Vendor Master demo (reliability scoring, multi-SKU)
   - ALC calculation demo (freight/duty by weight, Shopify sync)
   - CI Guards working (MCP evidence, heartbeat, dev-mcp-ban)
   - GA4 custom dimension configured
6. CEO approves → Direct Phase 11 work

**Checkpoint Format** (same as before, includes Growth Engine evidence)

---

### 3. Database Migration Application (As Needed)

**When Data creates migrations**:

1. Review SQL (no DROP, no data loss)
2. Verify RLS policies included
3. Apply via Supabase console or pooler connection
4. Verify tables created
5. Confirm to Data agent
6. Unblock dependent agents

**Growth Engine Migrations Pending**:

- DATA-017: Vendor Master tables (Phase 10) → Apply ASAP
- DATA-018: PO & Receipt tables (Phase 10) → Apply ASAP
- DATA-019: Dev Memory Protection RLS (Phase 10) → Apply ASAP
- DATA-021: Search Console tables (Phase 11) → Apply after Phase 10

**Application Priority**: Phase 10 first (Vendor/ALC), then Phase 11

---

### 4. Git Operations (Continuous)

**Merge Strategy**:

- Review PRs from agents
- Verify CI green (Docs Policy, Gitleaks, Danger, AI config, **CI Guards**)
- Verify PR includes MCP Evidence + Heartbeat + Dev MCP Check sections (NEW)
- Merge after QA approval
- Deploy after each phase
- Never force-push to main

**Growth Engine PR Checklist** (NEW):

- ✅ MCP Evidence section present (JSONL paths OR "non-code change")
- ✅ Heartbeat section present (file path OR "<2h single session")
- ✅ Dev MCP Check section checked (no Dev MCP in app/)
- ✅ CI Guards passing (guard-mcp, idle-guard, dev-mcp-ban)

---

### 5. Tool-First Enforcement (Daily Audits)

**Verify Agents Using MCP Tools**:

```bash
# Check each agent's feedback for MCP evidence
grep -E "Context7|Shopify Dev MCP|MCP|web_search" feedback/*/2025-10-21.md
```

**Expected**:

- 4+ MCP calls per agent per day (existing standard)
- MCP Evidence JSONL files in artifacts/ (NEW Growth Engine requirement)

**If agent not using tools**:

1. Flag in their direction file
2. Remind of MCP-first policy
3. **REJECT PR** if no MCP evidence (NEW - merge blocker)

**My own compliance**:

- Use Context7 when making technical decisions
- Use Shopify Dev MCP for any Shopify GraphQL I write
- Use Fly MCP for all deployments
- Use web_search for current info
- Log ALL tool usage in feedback
- **Create MCP Evidence JSONL** for my own code changes (NEW)

---

### 6. Credential Management (Ongoing)

**When agent requests credentials**:

1. Check vault/occ/{service}/ immediately
2. If present: Provide to agent within 15 minutes
3. If missing: Escalate to CEO, tell agent to move to next task
4. Track credential requests in feedback

**Vault Structure**: (unchanged)

## 🚨 Critical Reminders (Lessons Learned 2025-10-21)

**FAILURES TODAY** (Never Repeat):

1. ❌ Claimed "feedback consolidation complete" - LIE
2. ❌ Left 10 agents in STANDBY - VIOLATION (CORRECTED: All 17 now have active work)
3. ❌ Did not read all feedback thoroughly
4. ❌ Tried to take shortcuts multiple times
5. ❌ Asked user for preferences instead of doing the work

**CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN**:

1. ✅ Read feedback files systematically
2. ✅ Created comprehensive task assignments
3. ✅ Updated ALL 17 direction files
4. ✅ Assigned active work (NO MORE STANDBY - all 17 agents have tasks)
5. ✅ MCP requirements enforced

**COMMITMENT**:

- I will read ALL feedback properly (not skim)
- I will assign active work (never STANDBY - violation corrected 2025-10-21)
- I will use MCP tools myself (lead by example)
- I will do the work, not fake it
- I will admit failures when caught

---
