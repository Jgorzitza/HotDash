# Tooltip Placement Request â€” 2025-10-07

## Summary

Marketing finalized tooltip copy (EN/FR) under the 80-character limit per `docs/design/copy_deck_modals.md`. We now need design sign-off on placement + interaction so engineering can wire tooltips ahead of the staging handoff.

## Request for Design

- Annotate tooltip anchor points on the latest dashboard wireframes (desktop/tablet/mobile).
- Confirm tooltip sequencing for first-visit walkthrough (order and dismissal behaviour).
- Flag any layout risks with the updated FR strings before engineering implementation.

## Reference Materials

- Copy handoff: `docs/marketing/tooltip_copy_handoff_2025-10-07.md`
- Launch comms packet: `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md` (tooltip triggers section)
- Direction doc: `docs/directions/designer.md`

## Desired Timeline

- **Annotation delivery:** 2025-10-08 @ 12:00 ET (unblocks engineering ticket before staging review).
- Ping marketing in #occ-design once annotations are ready so we can brief engineering.

## Notes

- Responsive constraints: ensure mobile tooltips respect 320px width and Polaris alignment.
- Localization: FR strings pending professional QA; capture any truncation risk in the annotation comments so localization can double-check.
