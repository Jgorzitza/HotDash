# Operator Control Center — Testimonial Placeholders

Use this sheet to capture short quotes while external comms remain on hold. Replace placeholders with approved language once product/PR signs off. Keep each testimonial ≤240 characters for social reuse.

## Evergreen Outfitters — CX Lead (Operator Inbox Responsiveness)

- **Status:** To be captured during 2025-10-16 dry run debrief.
- **Prompt:** “How has the unified Operator Inbox changed your escalation response time?”
- **Placeholder:** _“The shared Operator Inbox means nothing slips—we clear escalations in minutes instead of hours.”_
- **Evidence Needed:** Chatwoot Fly latency logs + Operator Inbox audit trail snippet.

## Morgan Patel — Support Enablement (Internal Readiness)

- **Status:** Pending facilitator prep review.
- **Prompt:** “What changed for your team once the Chatwoot Fly migration went live?”
- **Placeholder:** _“Fly hosting keeps the inbox snappy; we can approve AI responses without waiting on Sync.”_
- **Evidence Needed:** Support macro update confirmation + Fly healthcheck artifact.

## Riley Chen — Beta Partner (Staging Walkthrough)

- **Status:** To be captured after beta walkthrough rescheduled post-QA gate.
- **Prompt:** “What value did the Operator Inbox/AI pair bring during your trial?”
- **Placeholder:** _“Operator Control Center puts every decision and AI draft in one place—we act before issues hit customers.”_
- **Evidence Needed:** Beta feedback notes + Operator Inbox decision IDs.

## Notes

- Log final quotes in `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md` once approved.
- Attach supporting evidence (internal channel thread, email approval, recording timestamp) in `feedback/marketing.md` when we promote placeholders to live copy.
