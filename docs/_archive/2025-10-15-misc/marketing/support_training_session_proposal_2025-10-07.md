# Support Training Session Proposal — Operator Control Center

## Objective

Align support, marketing, and product on Operator Control Center launch messaging, walkthrough, and escalation handling ahead of production go-live.

## Proposed Schedule

- **Primary session:** Tuesday, 2025-10-15 @ 13:00 ET (90 minutes)
- **Backup slot:** Thursday, 2025-10-16 @ 10:00 ET (60-minute condensed refresher)
- **Audience:** Support agents, marketing, product liaison, localization
- **Location:** Zoom (link TBD); recording saved to shared drive per support SOP

## Agenda (Primary Session)

1. Welcome + objectives (5 min)
2. Dashboard walkthrough (Tiles + Modals) using latest staging build (25 min)
3. CX Escalations deep dive with decision audit trail demo (20 min)
4. Inventory Heatmap + SEO & Content Watch workflows (15 min)
5. FAQ review + objection handling practice (15 min)
6. Next steps + Q&A capture (10 min)

## Pre-Work for Attendees

- Review Operator FAQ: `docs/marketing/launch_faq.md`
- Skim brand tone deck: `docs/marketing/brand_tone_deck.md`
- Read CX escalation runbook updates: `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md`
- Have staging credentials ready (product to supply by 2025-10-13)

## Deliverables Post-Session

- Update training recording / timestamp notes in support knowledge base
- Capture top questions in Q&A template (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md`)
- Share clarified copy needs back to marketing/localization if new surfaces emerge

## Requests

- **Support:** Confirm which slot works best by 2025-10-09 and own invite distribution
- **Product:** Provide staging access + demo shop list for the walkthrough
- **Localization:** Be available for live FR copy clarifications during Q&A

## Notes

- Session assumes tooltip placements are finalized; marketing will update slides once design annotations land.
- If production launch date shifts, adjust training timing to remain ≥48h before go-live.
