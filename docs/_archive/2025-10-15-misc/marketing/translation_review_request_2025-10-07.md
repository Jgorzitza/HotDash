# Translation Review Request — Tooltip + Launch Assets

## Summary
Requesting professional French review for the updated tooltip copy and launch comms surfaces. Goal is to clear P1 translation QA before staging sign-off.

## Scope
- Tooltip strings (Sales Pulse, CX Escalations, Inventory Heatmap, SEO & Content Watch, Approval Modal)
- Launch comms snippets under review: in-app banner headline/CTA variations, launch email subject options, blog subhead
- FAQ introduction + key answers referencing configuration/integrations

## Reference Docs
- Tooltip copy table: `docs/marketing/tooltip_copy_handoff_2025-10-07.md`
- Product approval packet (copy variations): `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md`
- Operator FAQ: `docs/marketing/launch_faq.md`
- Brand tone guidance: `docs/marketing/brand_tone_deck.md`

## Requested Actions (Localization)
1. Validate FR strings for tone ("vous" form), clarity, and length within provided limits.
2. Flag any layout risks or recommend shorter alternates (<80 characters for tooltips, <70 characters for banner headline).
3. Provide approved strings or redlines in `feedback/localization.md` with references to the relevant doc + line numbers.

## Timeline
- **Kickoff:** 2025-10-07
- **Target completion:** 2025-10-09 @ 18:00 ET (feeds into staging comms review)

## Notes
- Please coordinate with design if alternate strings impact layout annotations.
- Banner FR variant currently uses abbreviation "Centre OCC" to stay within the 80-character limit—confirm if acceptable or propose alternative.
- Attach supporting evidence (style guide approvals) per direction governance requirements.
