## Upsell Strategies

### Basic → Enterprise Upgrade

**Trigger Points**:

- Customer exceeds 5,000 tickets/month for 2 consecutive months
- Customer requests multi-agent support
- Team grows beyond 25 operators
- Customer asks for custom integrations or SSO

**Upsell Pitch**:

> "You're growing fast! Enterprise tier gives you 4x ticket capacity (20K vs 5K), multi-agent support (Billing, Technical, Pre-Sales), and priority support—all for $1,500 more per month. Based on your current growth, you'll hit the 5K limit in 2 months anyway."

**Success Rate Target**: 25% of Basic customers upgrade within 12 months
