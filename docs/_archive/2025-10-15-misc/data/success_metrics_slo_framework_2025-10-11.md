# Success Metrics & SLO Framework — HotDash OCC Sprint 2025-10-11

## Product & Release Metrics

### 1. DEPLOY-147 Evidence Completeness Rate

**Definition:** Daily percentage of required artifacts present for production readiness
**Formula:** `(completed_evidence_items / total_required_items) * 100`
**Target:** 100% completion by 2025-10-16
**Current Status:** 25% (1/4 major items complete)

**Required Evidence Items (Total: 4)**

- [x] Sanitized history push documented (af1d9f1) — ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] Sub-300ms ?mock=0 performance proof with timestamp — 🔴 PENDING
- [ ] Playwright test suite rerun with complete artifacts — 🔴 PENDING
- [ ] Embed token validation and compliance clearance — 🔴 BLOCKED
- [ ] Nightly AI logging cadence alignment verified — 🟡 IN PROGRESS

**Daily Tracking:**

- 2025-10-11: 25% (1/4) — Baseline established
- Target progression: +25% every 2 days to reach 100% by 2025-10-16

### 2. Index Freshness Compliance

**Definition:** LlamaIndex data freshness maintained under 24-hour threshold  
**Formula:** `hours_since_last_rebuild < 24`
**Target:** <24 hours staleness, 99%+ rebuild success rate
**Monitoring:** Real-time via nightly artifact bundles

**SLA Thresholds:**

- ✅ GREEN: <24 hours (compliant)
- ⚠️ YELLOW: 24-36 hours (degraded)
- 🔴 RED: >36 hours (violation)

### 3. Operator Latency P95 Performance

**Definition:** 95th percentile response time for operator dashboard queries
**Target:** <300ms P95 latency on staging environment with full data load
**Measurement:** Staging synthetic checks + Playwright performance validation

**Performance Buckets:**

- Excellent: <200ms P95
- Target: <300ms P95
- Degraded: 300-500ms P95
- Failing: >500ms P95

### 4. QA Test Pass Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of must-have tests passing in staging environment
**Target:** 100% pass rate for critical path scenarios
**Scope:** Playwright end-to-end tests, performance benchmarks, security validations

**Test Categories:**

- Critical Path: 100% pass required (blocks deployment)
- Important Features: 95% pass target
- Nice-to-have: 85% pass acceptable

### 5. Compliance Approvals Received

**Definition:** Vendor DPA/SCC approvals obtained and documented
**Target:** 3/3 vendor processes complete by 2025-10-16
**Tracking:** Daily vendor response rate and escalation effectiveness

**Vendor Status Matrix:**

- Supabase SCC: BLOCKED (ticket #SUP-49213, escalation active)
- OpenAI DPA: PENDING (manager coordination required)
- GA MCP: PENDING (integrations team follow-up)

## Operational Metrics

### 1. Nightly Job Success Rate

**Definition:** Automated nightly logging pipeline execution success
**Target:** 100% successful runs OR immediate rerun with incident note
**Schedule:** 02:00 UTC daily execution window
**Recovery SLA:** <30 minutes to detect and rerun failed jobs

**Success Criteria:**

- Execution starts within 02:00-02:05 UTC window
- All 6 artifact files generated with valid checksums
- Evidence bundle linked in feedback/product.md by 08:30 UTC
- No data quality violations or PII exposure incidents

### 2. Chatwoot Support Response Time

**Definition:** SLA compliance for CX escalation handling via OCC
**Target:** <60 minutes median response time for SLA breaches
**Measurement:** Time from SLA breach detection to first operator action

**Response Time Buckets:**

- Excellent: <30 minutes
- Target: <60 minutes
- Degraded: 60-120 minutes
- Violation: >120 minutes

### 3. Team Coordination Response Rate

**Definition:** Average response time to blocker updates and escalation requests
**Target:** <2 hours during business hours, <24 hours off-hours
**Measurement:** Time from blocker update to team acknowledgement/action

**Response SLA by Team:**

- Product: <1 hour (coordination role)
- QA: <2 hours (evidence validation)
- Compliance: <4 hours (legal review complexity)
- Data: <2 hours (technical validation)

## Monitoring & Alerting Framework

### Real-time Tracking Dashboard

```
Current Status — 2025-10-11T01:55:00Z

🔴 DEPLOY-147 Evidence: 25% complete (1/4 items)
🟡 Index Freshness: TBD (pipeline not yet active)
🔴 Latency P95: TBD (staging access blocked)
🔴 QA Pass Rate: TBD (embed token dependency)
🔴 Compliance: 0/3 approvals received

🟡 Nightly Jobs: Not yet implemented (setup in progress)
🔴 CX Response: TBD (Chatwoot integration pending)
🟢 Team Coordination: <1 hour response average (established)
```

### Daily Metrics Collection Points

- **08:30 UTC:** Evidence bundle freshness check + metrics update
- **09:30 UTC:** Morning blocker status + compliance progress update
- **16:30 UTC:** Afternoon coordination efficiency + vendor response tracking
- **17:00 UTC:** Daily summary with SLO status and trend analysis

### Escalation Triggers

**Critical (Immediate Manager Alert):**

- DEPLOY-147 evidence completion <25% by 2025-10-13
- > 36 hours index staleness detected
- > 500ms P95 latency in staging environment
- Any compliance violation or PII exposure incident

**Warning (Product Agent Action):**

- Nightly job failure detection
- Team response time >SLA threshold for >4 hours
- Vendor escalation no-response for >48 hours
- QA test pass rate <95% for critical path

**Info (Tracking Only):**

- Minor performance degradation within acceptable bounds
- Team coordination efficiency trending downward but within SLA
- Documentation updates or process refinements needed

## Success Criteria & Sprint Exit Conditions
