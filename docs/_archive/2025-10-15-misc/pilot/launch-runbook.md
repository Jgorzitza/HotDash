## Escalation Paths

### Level 1: Minor Issues (Product Agent Handles)
**Examples**: UX confusion, tile layout preferences, feature requests

**Response Time**: <2 hours during business hours

**Process**:
1. CEO reports issue via Slack or call
2. Product Agent logs issue
3. Product Agent creates ticket (P2/P3)
4. Product Agent responds with timeline

---

### Level 2: Bugs (Engineer Required)
**Examples**: Data inaccuracy, tile not loading, approval queue broken

**Response Time**: <4 hours for P1, same-day for P2

**Process**:
1. CEO reports bug
2. Product Agent reproduces bug
3. Product Agent escalates to Engineer
4. Engineer fixes (same-day for P1)
5. Product Agent confirms fix with CEO

---

### Level 3: Critical Issues (All Hands)
**Examples**: Dashboard down, data loss, security issue

**Response Time**: <30 minutes

**Process**:
1. CEO reports critical issue OR we detect it
2. Product Agent immediately escalates to Manager + Engineer
3. Manager calls CEO within 30 min
4. All hands fix issue
5. Post-mortem and prevention plan

**Criteria for Critical**:
- Dashboard completely unavailable
- Data loss or corruption
- Security/privacy breach
- CEO explicitly says "This is blocking us"

---

## Success Metrics (Week 1)

### Usage Metrics
- [ ] CEO logs in â‰¥5 days
- [ ] Avg session duration: 2-10 minutes
- [ ] Approvals processed: â‰¥1
- [ ] Mobile access used: Yes/No

### Satisfaction Metrics
- [ ] Week 1 rating: â‰¥6/10
- [ ] CEO shares â‰¥1 positive feedback
- [ ] No "I want to stop" signals

### Impact Metrics
- [ ] Time savings (CEO self-reported): â‰¥3 hours
- [ ] Quick wins: â‰¥1 (caught inventory alert, fast approval, etc.)

**If 2/3 metrics hit targets**: Week 1 success, continue pilot

---

## Contingency Plans

### Scenario 1: CEO Doesn't Use Dashboard
**Trigger**: <3 logins in first week

**Action**:
1. Call CEO immediately: "We noticed you haven't been using it much. What's going on?"
2. Understand barrier: too busy, not useful, forgot, etc.
3. Options:
   - Simplify (reduce to 2-3 core tiles)
   - Daily reminder (Slack bot or email digest)
   - Extend Week 1 by 3-5 days
   - Pause pilot if CEO isn't committed

---

### Scenario 2: Data Accuracy Issues
**Trigger**: CEO reports "This number is wrong"

**Action**:
1. Reproduce issue immediately
2. Compare HotDash data vs Shopify directly
3. Fix within 2 hours
4. Call CEO to confirm fix
5. If happens twice: Full data audit before continuing

**Critical**: CEO must trust data. If trust breaks, pilot fails.

---

### Scenario 3: Dashboard Too Slow
**Trigger**: CEO reports "This is too slow to use"

**Action**:
1. Measure load times (should be <2 seconds)
2. Optimize immediately (caching, query optimization)
3. Target: <1 second load time
4. Confirm improvement with CEO

---

### Scenario 4: CEO Wants to Stop
**Trigger**: CEO says "I don't think this is working"

**Action**:
1. Don't argue or defend
2. Ask: "Help me understandâ€”what's not working?"
3. Assess: Is it fixable in 2-3 days?
   - If YES: Fix and ask for 3 more days
   - If NO: Exit gracefully
4. Exit interview: Document learnings
5. Part ways professionally

---

**Document Path**: `docs/pilot/launch-runbook.md`  
**Owner**: Product Agent  
**Status**: âœ… Ready for Hot Rodan launch execution (Oct 15)  
**Next**: Execute day-by-day starting Oct 15, 2025
