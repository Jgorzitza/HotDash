## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: CEO Doesn't Use Dashboard
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (pilot fails if not used)

**Mitigation**:
- Make onboarding super simple (5-minute quick start)
- Mobile access (check on the go)
- Daily Slack/email digest (pull them in)
- Weekly check-ins (accountability)

**Trigger**: If CEO doesn't log in 3+ days in Week 1 → Call immediately to understand why

---

### Risk 2: Data Quality Issues
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (CEO loses trust if data wrong)

**Mitigation**:
- Verify all data sources during setup
- Show "Last updated" timestamps on tiles
- Test common scenarios with Hot Rodan team
- Fast fixes for any discrepancies reported

**Trigger**: If CEO reports "This number is wrong" → Fix within 2 hours

---

### Risk 3: Dashboard Too Complex
**Likelihood**: Low-Medium
**Impact**: Medium (CEO gets confused, doesn't use)

**Mitigation**:
- Start with 3-4 core tiles (not all 10)
- Quick start guide with screenshots
- Weekly walkthroughs to build confidence
- Simplify UI based on feedback

**Trigger**: If CEO says "I'm confused" → Immediate call to simplify

---

### Risk 4: Not Enough Value
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High (pilot fails, no conversion)

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on CEO's top pain points (time savings, approvals)
- Quick wins in Week 1 (catch 1 inventory alert = $5K saved)
- Continuous iteration based on feedback
- Show ROI clearly (time saved × CEO hourly rate)

**Trigger**: If CEO rating <6/10 in Week 2 → Deep dive call to course-correct

---

## Success Playbook

- ✅ CEO logs in ≥5 days
- ✅ CEO completes morning routine workflow
- ✅ At least 1 "quick win" (e.g., caught inventory alert, approved decision fast)

## Appendix: Hot Rodan Context
