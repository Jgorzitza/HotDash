  schedule:
    - cron: "0 10 * * *" # 10:00 UTC daily
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  daily-triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetch Linear issues
        run: |
          # Query Linear API for all active issues
          # Filter by current sprint and project
          # Group by priority and status

      - name: Calculate impact scores
        run: |
          # Run impact scoring algorithm
          # Update issue priorities based on scoring
          # Generate triage report

```

## Impact Scoring Algorithm

### Primary Factors (Weighted Scoring)

1. **DEPLOY-147 Impact** (Weight: 40%)
   - Direct blocker: 100 points
   - Indirect dependency: 70 points
   - Supporting evidence: 40 points
   - No relation: 0 points

2. **Compliance Milestone Impact** (Weight: 30%)
   - SCC/DPA approval blocker: 100 points
   - Audit requirement: 70 points
   - Documentation need: 40 points
   - No compliance impact: 0 points

3. **Sprint Timeline Urgency** (Weight: 20%)
   - Must complete this week: 100 points
   - Must complete this sprint: 70 points
   - Can slip to next sprint: 40 points
   - Long-term backlog: 10 points

4. **Stakeholder Impact** (Weight: 10%)
   - Manager escalation: 100 points
   - Customer-facing issue: 70 points
   - Internal process improvement: 40 points
   - Nice-to-have enhancement: 10 points

### Impact Score Calculation

```typescript
// scripts/ops/impact-scoring.ts
interface IssueImpactScore {
  issueId: string;
  title: string;
  currentPriority: string;
  deployImpact: number;
  complianceImpact: number;
  timelineUrgency: number;
  stakeholderImpact: number;
  totalScore: number;
  recommendedPriority: string;
}

function calculateImpactScore(issue: LinearIssue): IssueImpactScore {
  const weights = {
    deploy: 0.4,
    compliance: 0.3,
    timeline: 0.2,
    stakeholder: 0.1,
  };

  const deployScore = assessDeployImpact(issue);
  const complianceScore = assessComplianceImpact(issue);
  const timelineScore = assessTimelineUrgency(issue);
  const stakeholderScore = assessStakeholderImpact(issue);

  const totalScore =
    deployScore * weights.deploy +
    complianceScore * weights.compliance +
    timelineScore * weights.timeline +
    stakeholderScore * weights.stakeholder;

  return {
    issueId: issue.id,
    title: issue.title,
    currentPriority: issue.priority,
    deployImpact: deployScore,
    complianceImpact: complianceScore,
    timelineUrgency: timelineScore,
    stakeholderImpact: stakeholderScore,
    totalScore: Math.round(totalScore),
    recommendedPriority: scoreToPriority(totalScore),
  };
}

function scoreToPriority(score: number): string {
  if (score >= 80) return "P0-Critical";
  if (score >= 60) return "P1-High";
  if (score >= 40) return "P2-Medium";
  return "P3-Low";
}
```

## Triage Process Flow

### 1. Data Collection (5 minutes)

```bash
# Fetch all active Linear issues
linear-cli issues list --state active --project "HotDash OCC Sprint" --format json > issues.json

# Fetch current sprint metadata
linear-cli projects show "HotDash OCC Sprint" --format json > sprint.json

# Fetch DEPLOY-147 status
linear-cli issues show DEPLOY-147 --format json > deploy-status.json
```

### 2. Impact Assessment (10 minutes)

- **Automated Scoring**: Run impact scoring algorithm on all issues
- **Manual Review**: Review high-impact score changes and edge cases
- **Dependency Analysis**: Check for new blockers or unblocked issues

### 3. Priority Adjustment (10 minutes)

- **Priority Updates**: Apply recommended priority changes
- **Label Management**: Update labels based on new priorities and categories
- **Assignment Review**: Ensure appropriate owners assigned

### 4. Documentation (5 minutes)

- **Triage Report**: Generate summary of priority changes
- **Feedback Update**: Log triage results in feedback/product.md
- **Sprint Link Update**: Update sprint view link if needed

## Backlog Prioritization Rules

### Priority Assignment Guidelines

#### P0-Critical (Sprint Blockers)

- **Criteria**: Blocks DEPLOY-147 or critical compliance milestone
- **Examples**: Failed nightly jobs, compliance violations, production issues
- **SLA**: Immediate attention, manager escalation if not addressed within 4 hours
- **WIP Limit**: Maximum 2 P0 issues active at any time

#### P1-High (Sprint Critical)

- **Criteria**: Must complete in current sprint, high DEPLOY-147 impact
- **Examples**: QA evidence gaps, performance optimization, documentation updates
- **SLA**: Daily progress check, escalate if blocked >24 hours
- **WIP Limit**: Maximum 5 P1 issues active at any time

#### P2-Medium (Sprint Important)

- **Criteria**: Important for sprint success but can slip if necessary
- **Examples**: Process improvements, automation enhancements, nice-to-have features
- **SLA**: Weekly progress review, can be deprioritized for higher priorities
- **WIP Limit**: No strict limit, but prefer focus on P0/P1

#### P3-Low (Backlog Items)

- **Criteria**: Future improvements, technical debt, long-term enhancements
- **Examples**: Code refactoring, documentation improvements, tool upgrades
- **SLA**: Monthly review, candidates for next sprint planning
- **WIP Limit**: Work on only when P0-P2 queues are clear

### Ad Hoc Request Handling

#### Request Intake Process

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Determine if request is critical (P0) or can wait for triage
2. **Linear Issue Creation**: Convert all requests to Linear issues with standard template
3. **Initial Labeling**: Apply appropriate labels and assign to triage queue
4. **Stakeholder Notification**: Acknowledge request and provide triage timeline

#### Standard Issue Template for Ad Hoc Requests

```markdown
Title: [REQUEST] [Brief Description]
Priority: [To be determined in triage]
Labels: request, triage-needed, [source-team]

## Request Details

- **Requestor**: [Name/Team]

```

### Backlog Grooming Rules

#### Weekly Grooming (Fridays 15:00 UTC)

- **Scope**: Review all P2-P3 issues for next sprint readiness
- **Actions**:
  - Clean up completed/duplicate issues
  - Update estimates and acceptance criteria
  - Identify issues ready for next sprint
  - Archive old/irrelevant issues

#### Sprint Boundary Management

- **Sprint Overflow**: Move incomplete P2-P3 issues to next sprint
- **Scope Creep Prevention**: Require manager approval for new P1+ items after sprint start
- **Velocity Tracking**: Track completion rates to improve future sprint planning

## Sprint View Maintenance

### Sprint Dashboard Link

**Location**: feedback/product.md Quick Navigation Index
**Update Frequency**: Daily during triage, weekly during grooming

async function handleNewLinearIssue(issue: LinearIssue) {
  // Auto-label as triage-needed
  await issue.addLabel("triage-needed");

  // Add to triage queue
  await addToTriageQueue(issue);

  // Set initial priority as P3-Low pending triage
  await issue.updatePriority("P3-Low");

  // Schedule for next triage window
  await scheduleForTriage(issue, getNextTriageTime());
}

// Handle priority changes
async function handlePriorityChange(
  issue: LinearIssue,
  oldPriority: string,
  newPriority: string,
) {
  // Log priority change
  await logPriorityChange(issue, oldPriority, newPriority);

  // Update watchers based on new priority
  if (newPriority === "P0-Critical") {
    await notifyManager(issue);
  }

  // Validate WIP limits
  await validateWIPLimits(newPriority);
}
```
