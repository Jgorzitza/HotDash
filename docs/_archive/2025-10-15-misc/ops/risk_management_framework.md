3. **SEV-3 (Medium)**: Minor functionality issues, workaround available
4. **SEV-4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, minimal user impact

### Incident Thresholds

#### Performance Thresholds
```typescript
interface PerformanceThresholds {
  responseTime: {
    p95Warning: 250,      // Warning at 250ms
    p95Critical: 400,     // Critical at 400ms
    p99Critical: 800      // P99 critical at 800ms
  },
  errorRate: {
    warning: 0.001,       // 0.1% error rate warning
    critical: 0.005       // 0.5% error rate critical
  },
  availability: {
    warning: 0.99,        // <99% uptime warning
