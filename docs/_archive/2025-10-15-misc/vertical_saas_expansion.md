## Vertical SaaS Approach

Instead of horizontal platform for all industries, create deep vertical solutions.

- Deep Shopify integration (admin API, Shopify Flow, POS)
- Shopify-specific KB templates
- Listed prominently in Shopify App Store

**Market Size**: 10,000+ Shopify Plus merchants
**Target Share**: 10% = 1,000 customers
**Revenue**: $1M-2.5M ARR from Shopify vertical alone

---

**Vertical 2: "HotDash for B2B SaaS"** (Year 3)

- Technical support focus
- API documentation integration
- Bug tracking workflows
- Subscription/billing automation

**Market Size**: 10,000+ B2B SaaS with support teams
**Target Share**: 5% = 500 customers
**Revenue**: $1M-2M ARR
