- **Current Status:** BLOCKED pending legal/compliance approval for token usage patterns
- **Watchers Required:** Product, Deployment, Integrations, QA, Compliance, Legal

## Twice-Daily Update Schedule

### Morning Update (09:30 UTC)

**Checklist items to assess and log:**

   - Staging environment accessibility tests by team

2. **Compliance Progress**
   - New vendor communications (Shopify DPA addendum)
   - Legal review status updates
   - Any compliance blockers or new requirements identified

3. **Evidence Collection**
   - New artifacts from reliability/deployment teams
   - QA test results if token access enabled
   - Documentation updates or approval emails received

4. **Required Team Actions**
   - Deployment: Environment setup or credential rotation needed
   - Integrations: API validation or Shopify app configuration
   - QA: Test suite execution or artifact collection
   - Compliance: Legal review progress or vendor escalations

### Afternoon Update (16:30 UTC)

**Checklist items to assess and log:**

1. **New Evidence or Incidents**
   - Any token-related failures or access issues during business hours

   - Integrations team vendor communication status
   - QA team readiness for testing once token cleared
   - Compliance team legal review timeline updates

3. **Escalation Decisions**
   - Whether to escalate specific blockers to manager level
   - Vendor communication timing and approach decisions
   - Resource allocation adjustments based on new information

4. **Next 24-Hour Action Plan**
   - Specific deliverables due from each team before next morning update
   - Vendor touchpoints scheduled with expected response timing
   - Decision points or go/no-go evaluations coming up

### 2. QA Testing Pass with Current Tokens

- **Required:** Full QA test suite execution with staging embed token
- **Performance:** Sub-300ms latency proof and Playwright test completion
- **Artifacts:** Test results, screenshots, and latency measurements documented
- **Evidence Path:** Link to DEPLOY-147 QA evidence bundle with token validation

### 3. Reliability Production Risk Signoff

- **Required:** Reliability team written signoff for production risk assessment
- **Scope:** Token rotation procedures, incident response, and monitoring coverage
- **Documentation:** Runbook references for token revocation and re-issuance
- **Evidence Path:** `feedback/reliability.md` entry with signoff timestamp and criteria

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category          | Likelihood | Impact | Current Mitigation                      | Owner       |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Token exposure in logs | Medium     | High   | TLS enforcement, log sanitization       | Engineering |
| Unauthorized access    | Low        | High   | Service key scoping, access controls    | Reliability |
| Compliance violation   | High       | Medium | Legal review in progress, DPA pending   | Compliance  |
| Production incident    | Medium     | High   | Incident response runbook, monitoring   | Reliability |
| QA test failures       | Medium     | Medium | Staging environment isolation, rollback | QA          |
