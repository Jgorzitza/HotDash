# Marketing & Support Privacy Comms Sign-off — Outreach Template

Use this template when requesting written confirmation that updated operator privacy language will ship in launch communications and support playbooks.

```
Subject: OCC privacy copy — request for launch confirmation (due <DATE>)

Hi <Name>,

Thanks again for partnering on the privacy updates. Quick confirmation request so we can close the sprint item:

- Collateral: <Email/Blog/FAQ/Support Script link>
- Privacy callouts included: Shopify Admin scope, Supabase telemetry retention (180 days), Settings → Privacy controls.
- Planned send/publish window: <DATE/TIME>

Could you please reply "Confirmed" (or provide edits) so we can archive the acknowledgement in `docs/compliance/evidence/operator_privacy_comms/` and log it in `feedback/compliance.md`?

Appreciate it!

Thanks,
<Your Name>
```

## Usage Notes

- Replace placeholders (`<...>`) with concrete dates, collateral links, and recipient names.
- Capture the confirmation email/# export in `docs/compliance/evidence/operator_privacy_comms/` once received.
- Reference the logged confirmation in `feedback/compliance.md` under the appropriate date.
