# Stack Compliance Audit Framework

## Audit Overview

**Created**: 2025-10-11T03:55:17Z  
**Purpose**: UI terminology and copy drift monitoring system  
**Schedule**: Bi-weekly audits (Mondays and Thursdays)  
**First Audit**: Monday 2025-10-14  
**Audit Lead**: Designer Agent (with engineering coordination)

## Audit Scope and Criteria

### UI Terminology Compliance

1. **Button Labels and Actions**
   - Consistency with design system terminology
   - Verb tense alignment (imperative voice for actions)
   - Accessibility requirements (descriptive, not ambiguous)
   - Cross-modal consistency (same actions use same labels)

2. **Form Field Labels**
   - Clear, descriptive field names
   - Consistent capitalization (sentence case vs title case)
   - Required field indicators consistent across forms
   - Error message terminology alignment

3. **Navigation and Menu Items**
   - Hierarchical consistency in menu structure
   - Icon-text alignment (icons match label meaning)
   - Breadcrumb terminology consistency
   - Link text clarity and action indication

4. **Status and Feedback Messages**
   - Success/error/warning message tone consistency
   - Technical language vs user-friendly explanations
   - Progress indicator terminology alignment
   - Toast notification message patterns

### Copy Drift Detection Areas

#### Modal Copy Consistency

- **CX Escalation Modal**: Header text, action labels, field labels
- **Sales Pulse Modal**: Metrics labels, action selection text, button labels
- **System Modals**: Confirmation dialogs, error modals, info modals
- **Cross-Modal**: Shared actions (Cancel, Save, Close) use consistent text

#### Dashboard Copy Alignment

- **Widget Titles**: Consistent capitalization and terminology
- **Metric Labels**: Standardized abbreviations and units
- **Filter Options**: Consistent option naming and categorization
- **Help Text**: Tone and technical level consistency

#### Form Copy Standards

- **Field Labels**: Consistent patterns for similar data types
- **Placeholder Text**: Helpful examples without being directive
- **Validation Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Success Feedback**: Positive reinforcement patterns

## Audit Methodology

### Pre-Audit Preparation (30 minutes)

1. **Baseline Documentation Review**
   - Current design system terminology guide
   - Brand voice and tone guidelines
   - Previous audit findings and remediation status
   - New feature implementations since last audit

2. **Tool Setup and Environment Check**
   - Design system documentation accessible
   - Testing environment configured for UI inspection
   - Screen capture tools ready for evidence collection
   - Audit checklist template prepared

### Audit Execution Process (90 minutes)

#### Phase 1: Automated Scanning (30 minutes)

- **Text Extraction**: Use browser dev tools to extract all visible text
- **Pattern Matching**: Compare against approved terminology database
- **Inconsistency Flagging**: Identify potential drift candidates for manual review
- **Screenshot Documentation**: Capture evidence of flagged inconsistencies

#### Phase 2: Manual Review (45 minutes)

- **User Journey Walkthrough**: Follow key user paths checking copy consistency
- **Cross-Component Comparison**: Verify similar components use consistent language
- **Accessibility Review**: Ensure screen reader text aligns with visual text
- **Context Validation**: Verify copy makes sense within user workflow context

#### Phase 3: Documentation and Prioritization (15 minutes)

- **Issue Classification**: Critical/High/Medium/Low priority levels
- **Impact Assessment**: User experience and brand consistency impact
- **Remediation Recommendations**: Specific text changes and rationale
- **Evidence Package Assembly**: Screenshots and detailed findings
