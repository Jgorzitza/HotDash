# Supabase SCC Evidence Placeholder â€” 2025-10-11

- **Status:** Awaiting countersigned Standard Contractual Clauses bundle from Supabase support (requested 2025-10-11 14:05 UTC, ticket ref pending).
- **Next action:** Attach PDF/HTML copy of signed SCC Annexes and vendor acknowledgement email immediately upon receipt.
- **Verification checklist:**
  1. Confirm controller/processor parties populated with HotDash legal entity details.
  2. Ensure Annex I Sections A/B/C include Supabase project identifiers and data transfer descriptions.
  3. Capture Supabase representative signature + date; if unsigned, escalate to manager by 2025-10-14 17:00 UTC.
  4. Hash stored files (SHA256) and log values in `docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/scc/hash_register.md`.
- **Escalation:** If no response by SLA, log blocker in `feedback/compliance.md` and request manager escalation to Supabase account team.
