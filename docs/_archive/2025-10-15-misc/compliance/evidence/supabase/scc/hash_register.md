# Supabase SCC Hash Register â€” Placeholder

Use this table to capture cryptographic fingerprints for every artifact delivered with the countersigned Supabase SCC package. Fill it in immediately after files land and store alongside the signed PDFs or HTML exports.

| Date Logged (UTC) | Artifact Description | File Path | SHA256 Hash | Logged By |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| TBD | Supabase SCC bundle (PDF) | docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/scc/Supabase_SCC_2025-10-XX.pdf | TBD | TBD |
| TBD | Vendor acknowledgement email (EML/HTML) | docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/scc/Supabase_SCC_Ack_2025-10-XX.eml | TBD | TBD |

## Next Steps
- Replace placeholder rows with actual entries once the SCC arrives.
- Add additional rows for annex attachments or supporting confirmations as required.
- Mirror hashes into `feedback/compliance.md` daily log for audit trail.
