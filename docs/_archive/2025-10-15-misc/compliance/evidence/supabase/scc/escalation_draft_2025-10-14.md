# Supabase SCC Escalation Draft — Trigger if No Response by 2025-10-14 17:00 UTC

Prepared message to escalate through account channels if the countersigned SCC bundle and region confirmation remain outstanding. Calendar reminder set for 2025-10-14 16:30 UTC to finalize ticket details before send.

```
Subject: Urgent: Need countersigned SCC + region confirmation for HotDash Supabase project (Ticket #SUP-49213)

Hi Jordan,

Following up on ticket #SUP-49213 opened 2025-10-11 requesting the countersigned SCC package and explicit region confirmation for our HotDash project. We need the executed annexes and residency statement before we can green-light Shopify admin testing scheduled for 2025-10-15.

Outstanding items:
- Countersigned SCC bundle with HotDash entity details populated in Annex I
- Confirmation of project region (expecting us-east-1, please confirm or correct)
- ETA for pg_cron first-run evidence (retention jobs) promised in the original request

We’re at the escalation SLA (2025-10-14 17:00 UTC). Please provide the documents or a concrete delivery timeline today; otherwise we’ll need to elevate through executive contacts per our agreement.

Thanks for the quick assist — happy to jump on a call if helpful.

Regards,
Casey Lin
Compliance, HotDash

Next Steps:

- Fill in ticket ID and rep name before sending.
- Archive vendor response and hashes in the SCC evidence directory on receipt.
  Calendar follow-up: If no response by 2025-10-14 17:00 UTC, send this escalation and page manager immediately after.
