Hi <Name>,

Quick confirmation request on the updated privacy language before we lock the launch packet:
- Collateral: launch email/blog + FAQ (links above)
- Callouts included: Shopify Admin-only access, Supabase telemetry retention (180 days), Settings → Privacy controls toggle
- Target send window: 2025-10-15 launch go/no-go (TBC)

Please reply "Confirmed" (or share edits) by 2025-10-13 22:00 UTC so we can archive the acknowledgement in compliance evidence.

Thanks!
Casey
