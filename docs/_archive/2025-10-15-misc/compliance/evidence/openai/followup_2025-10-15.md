# OpenAI DPA Follow-up â€” 2025-10-15 19:38 UTC

- Submitted combined email + enterprise support portal message referencing prior case ID; reiterated requirements (DPA, prompt retention opt-out confirmation, EU endpoint guarantee, SOC 2 Type II summary).
- Requested human response or scheduled call by 2025-10-16 18:00 UTC; highlighted that lack of confirmation blocks AI feature rollout.
- Attached privacy requirements checklist (`docs/compliance/evidence/openai/requirements_checklist.md`) and committed to share purge enforcement evidence once retention automation validated.
- Awaiting response; prepared escalation memo for manager review if no update by deadline.
