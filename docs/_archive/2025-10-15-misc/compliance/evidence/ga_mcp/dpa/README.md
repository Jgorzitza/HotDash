# GA MCP DPA Evidence Placeholder â€” 2025-10-12

- **Status:** Awaiting Google Analytics MCP Data Processing Addendum and regional commitment letter (requested 2025-10-07 via ticket TBD).
- **Next action:** Attach signed DPA (PDF/HTML) and regional confirmation as soon as the vendor responds.
- **Verification checklist:**
  1. Confirm HotDash legal entity details are correctly populated in the controller fields.
  2. Capture subprocessor appendix and retention defaults.
  3. Hash stored files (SHA256) and record values in `docs/compliance/evidence/ga_mcp/hash_register.md` (placeholder below).
- **Escalation:** Flag manager if no vendor acknowledgement by 2025-10-15 18:00 UTC.
