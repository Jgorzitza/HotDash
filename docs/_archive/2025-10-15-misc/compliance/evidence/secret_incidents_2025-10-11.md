# Secret Incidents Sweep - 2025-10-11

Scan summary:

- Performed targeted grep across docs/compliance/evidence for keywords: rotation, leaked, incident, exposed, revoked.
- High-level hits observed in tabletop_supabase_scenario.md referencing credential rotation and incident response steps.
- No explicit recent rotation evidence files detected beyond existing pg_cron retention materials.

Next steps:

- If rotation evidence for any recent incident is missing, prepare rotation checklist and schedule.
- Cross-check CI secret_scan workflow coverage (see artifacts/compliance/stack_audit_2025-10-11.md).
