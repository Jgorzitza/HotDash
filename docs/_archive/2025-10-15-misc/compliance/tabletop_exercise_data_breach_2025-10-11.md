```

**Scenario Injects:**
- T+5min: Second alert shows data export attempt
- T+15min: Service key identified as potentially compromised
- T+30min: Customer PII confirmed in accessed records
- T+1h: Regulatory notification trigger (>50 data subjects)

---

## Response Timeline & Actions

### Phase 1: Detection & Containment (0-30 minutes)

**T+0 (03:00 UTC) - Alert Received**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Alert forwarded to #incidents Slack channel
2. ✅ On-call reliability engineer paged
3. ✅ Compliance officer notified (this agent)
4. ✅ Initial incident log created

**Decisions:**

**Communications:**
```
INCIDENT #2025-10-15-001 - CRITICAL
Time: 03:00 UTC
Type: Potential data breach
Impact: Customer conversation data
Status: INVESTIGATING
Team: Reliability (lead), Compliance, Security, Manager
Next Update: 03:30 UTC
```

**T+10 (03:10 UTC) - Initial Investigation**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Reviewed Supabase audit logs
2. ✅ Identified service key used: SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY_STAGING
3. ✅ Confirmed 247 conversations accessed
4. ✅ IP address geolocation: Unknown origin (not team)

**Decisions:**
- Service key potentially compromised
- Immediate key rotation required
- Access to be revoked

**T+20 (03:20 UTC) - Containment Actions**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Revoked compromised service key in Supabase dashboard
2. ✅ Generated new service key
3. ✅ Updated vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env
4. ✅ Deployed services with new key
5. ✅ Verified unauthorized access stopped

**Decisions:**
- Access successfully contained
- No further unauthorized queries detected
- Data exfiltration extent unknown (logs analysis needed)

**T+30 (03:30 UTC) - Scope Assessment**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Analyzed audit logs for data export attempts
2. ✅ Identified 247 conversations accessed (full records)
3. ✅ Customer PII confirmed in records:
   - 247 customer names
   - 247 customer email addresses
   - Message content (varying sensitivity)
4. ✅ No evidence of successful data export (logs show SELECT only, no export)

**Decisions:**
- Data breach confirmed (access to customer PII)
- Regulatory notification required (GDPR 72h, CCPA 45 days)
- Customer notification required (GDPR Article 34)
- Severity remains CRITICAL

---

### Phase 2: Investigation & Assessment (30min - 2 hours)

**T+45 (03:45 UTC) - Forensic Analysis**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Preserved audit logs for forensic review
2. ✅ Identified access pattern: Single IP, 15-minute window
3. ✅ Confirmed service key compromise source: Unknown (investigation ongoing)
4. ✅ Reviewed recent code commits for key exposure
5. ✅ Checked git history for key leakage (none found)

**Findings:**
- Service key likely compromised via unknown vector
- No evidence of key in git history
- Access pattern suggests automated script
- No evidence of data exfiltration (SELECT only)

**T+60 (04:00 UTC) - Impact Assessment**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Categorized data accessed:
   - 247 customer names (PII)
   - 247 customer emails (PII)
   - Message content (potential sensitive info)
   - No payment data (not stored)
   - No special category data identified
2. ✅ Assessed risk to data subjects:
   - Identity theft risk: LOW (no SSN, payment data)
   - Spam/phishing risk: MEDIUM (email addresses)
   - Privacy violation: HIGH (message content)
3. ✅ Determined notification requirements:
   - GDPR: Required (>50 subjects, high risk to rights)
   - CCPA: Required (if CA residents affected)
   - Individual notification: Required if high risk

**Decisions:**
- Supervisor authority (Data Protection Authority) notification required
- Individual customer notification required
- Public disclosure: TBD (depends on risk assessment)

**T+90 (04:30 UTC) - Root Cause Analysis**

**Investigation Findings:**
1. Service key source: vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env
2. Compromise vector: TBD (possibilities: phishing, malware, insider)
3. Access method: Direct API access with valid credentials
4. Exfiltration: No evidence found (monitoring continues)

**Security Control Failures:**
- IP address allowlisting not implemented (recommendation)
- Service key rotation overdue (FALSE - was current)
- Alerting delayed by 5 minutes (acceptable)
