### 2.2 Recognizing Phishing Emails

**Red Flag Checklist:**

- [ ] **Urgency** - "Act now!", "Account will be suspended!"
- [ ] **Fear tactics** - Threats, warnings, consequences
- [ ] **Requests credentials** - Asks for password, credit card, 2FA code
- [ ] **Suspicious sender** - Email doesn't match company domain
- [ ] **Generic greeting** - "Dear customer" instead of your name
- [ ] **Poor grammar** - Spelling errors, awkward phrasing
- [ ] **Unexpected attachment** - Files you didn't ask for
- [ ] **Mismatched URLs** - Link text says one thing, actual URL is different

**Example Phishing Email:**
```
From: shopify-security@shopifiy.com (NOTE: misspelling!)
Subject: URGENT: Your account will be suspended

Dear Shopify User,

Your account has been flagged for suspicious activity. To avoid suspension,
click here immediately to verify your account:

[Verify Account Now] ‚Üê This links to fake-shopify.com

You have 24 hours or your account will be permanently disabled.

Shopify Security Team
```

**Red Flags in Example:**
- ‚ùå Misspelling in email (shopifiy vs shopify)
- ‚ùå Generic greeting
- ‚ùå Urgent threat
- ‚ùå Requests verification (phishing for credentials)
- ‚ùå Time pressure

---

### 2.3 Real vs. Fake Email Comparison

**FAKE Email (Phishing):**
```
From: security@sh0pify.com (0 instead of o)
Subject: URGENT ACTION REQUIRED

Your Shopify account has been compromised. Click here to secure it now.

[Secure My Account] (links to fake-shopify-login.com)
```

**REAL Email (Legitimate):**
```
From: no-reply@shopify.com
Subject: Shopify Login Notification

Hi [Your Name],

We noticed a new login to your Shopify account from [Location]. 
If this was you, no action needed.

If this wasn't you, secure your account:
https://accounts.shopify.com/security

Need help? Visit Shopify Help Center.

Thanks,
The Shopify Team
```

**Differences:**
- ‚úÖ Real email uses official @shopify.com
- ‚úÖ Personal greeting with your name

**How to Handle Privacy Requests:**
1. Recognize the request (subject line: "Privacy Request")
2. Follow DSR procedure in `docs/runbooks/data_subject_requests.md`
3. Escalate to compliance team
4. Don't process manually (compliance handles it)

### 4.4 AI-Assisted Support

- ‚úÖ Always read AI suggestions before approving

- ‚úÖ Report recurring AI errors
- ‚úÖ Inform customers AI is used (if asked)

- Missing context
- Privacy concern
- Better to write manually

### 4.5 Data Retention

**How Long We Keep Data:**
