## Vision

No-code workflow builder allowing operators to create custom automation rules without engineering help.

IF customer_message contains "refund"
AND order_value < $50
AND within_return_window = true
THEN auto_approve_refund
AND send_draft_response("refund_approved_template")
```

**User Interface**: Drag-and-drop workflow builder (similar to Zapier)

**Launch**: Month 9 (Jul 2026)
