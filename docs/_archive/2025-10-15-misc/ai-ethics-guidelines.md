# AI Ethics Guidelines

**Task AH**

## Principles

1. **Transparency**: Customers know they're interacting with AI
2. **Fairness**: Equal treatment across demographics
3. **Privacy**: No PII leakage, data minimization
4. **Accountability**: Human oversight for high-stakes decisions
5. **Safety**: Harm prevention, content filtering

## Implementation

- Regular ethics review

**Review:** Monthly with diverse stakeholders
