## Week 1 Success Criteria (Conservative Targets)

### Operator Happiness (Most Important!)

**Metric 1: Operator Satisfaction**
- **Target**: >6.5/10 (realistic for learning curve)
- **Measurement**: Daily quick poll at end of shift (1 question, 30 seconds)
- **Question**: "How did Agent SDK make your job today? (1-10)"
- **Green flag**: Scores trending up day-over-day

**Metric 2: Would Recommend**
- **Target**: >60% say "yes" by Friday
- **Question**: "Would you recommend this tool to other operators?"
- **Measurement**: Friday survey

**Metric 3: Time Saved (Perceived)**
- **Target**: >70% say they saved time
- **Question**: "Did Agent SDK save you time today?"
- **Measurement**: Daily quick poll

---

### Technical Performance (System Works)

**Metric 4: System Uptime**
- **Target**: >98% (14 minutes downtime max over 24 hours)
- **Measurement**: Pingdom monitoring
- **Red flag**: Any downtime >5 minutes

**Metric 5: Error Rate**
- **Target**: <2% of drafts have errors
- **Measurement**: Count errors reported in standups
- **Red flag**: >5 errors in one day

---

### Agent Quality (AI Doing Its Job)

**Metric 6: Approval Rate**
- **Target**: >35% (Week 1 is learning phase)
- **Measurement**: (Approved without edits) / (Total reviewed)
- **Calculation**: If 100 drafts reviewed, 35+ approved = success

**Metric 7: Rejection Rate**
- **Target**: <10% (drafts completely discarded)
- **Measurement**: (Rejected) / (Total reviewed)
- **Red flag**: >20% means AI quality is poor

---

### Customer Experience (No Harm Done)

**Metric 8: CSAT Maintained**
- **Target**: ≥4.2 (same as baseline, no degradation)
- **Measurement**: Post-interaction surveys
- **Red flag**: Drop below 4.0 = pause pilot immediately

**Metric 9: Time to Resolution**
- **Target**: ≤15 minutes (same as baseline or better)
- **Measurement**: Ticket close time - open time
- **Green flag**: <12 minutes (improvement!)
