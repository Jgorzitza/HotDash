- Explain common failure reasons (expired card, insufficient funds)
- Guide customer through payment retry
- Escalate to billing specialist if fraud suspected

#### 2. Refund Request Processing

- Check refund eligibility (return window, condition)
- Calculate refund amount (original price - restocking fee)
- Generate refund approval draft (for amounts <$100)
- Escalate to manager for refunds >$100

#### 3. Billing Inquiry Handling

- Explain charges on invoice
- Clarify tax calculations
- Provide payment history

- Never display full credit card numbers
- Audit trail for all billing actions

**Success Metrics**:

- Billing inquiry resolution: <5 minutes average
- Escalation to manager only when needed (<5% inappropriate escalations)

**Development Effort**: 3-4 weeks
**Pilot Timeline**: 2 weeks with 3-5 operators
**ROI**: Medium-High (billing inquiries are time-consuming to handle manually)

---

## Agent 3: Technical Support Agent

- Asks diagnostic questions: "What lights do you see?"

#### 2. Integration Help

- Assist with API integration questions
- Provide code examples
- Debug common integration errors
- Reference API documentation

**Example Inquiry**: "Getting 401 error when calling inventory API"
**AI Draft**:

#### 3. Bug Report Triage

- Collect reproduction steps
- Identify severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Check if known issue (search existing bug reports)
- Create ticket for engineering if new bug

**Example Inquiry**: "App crashes when I try to checkout"
**AI Draft**:

- Asks clarifying questions: "What device? What browser?"
- Searches known bugs database
- If known: "This is a known issue, fix coming in next release"
- If new: Creates engineering ticket, provides workaround

#### 4. Feature Requests

- Engineers should review and approve technical responses

**Escalation Paths**:

- P0/P1 bugs: Immediate escalation to engineering
- API issues: Route to integration specialist
- Feature requests: Log and acknowledge, don't promise timelines

**Success Metrics**:

- Technical accuracy: >85% (engineering review)
- Escalation accuracy: >90% (correct severity assessment)
- Time to triage bugs: <3 minutes

**Development Effort**: 4-6 weeks (requires technical knowledge base)
**Pilot Timeline**: 3 weeks with 2-3 technical operators

- Highlights key features for outdoor use
- Links to product pages

#### 2. Pricing Questions

- Explain pricing tiers
- Calculate discounts and promotions
- Clarify shipping costs
- Provide total cost estimates

**Example Inquiry**: "How much with shipping to Canada?"
**AI Draft**:

## Phased Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: General Support (Oct 2025 - Mar 2026)

**Focus**: Perfect the core agent before expanding

- Launch pilot (Oct 28)
- Full rollout (Nov 18)
- Optimize through Month 6

**Success Criteria**:

- Approval rate >70%
- Operator satisfaction >8.5/10

**Timeline**:

- Month 6: Development (3-4 weeks)
- Month 7: Pilot with 3 billing specialists
- Month 8: Full rollout to billing team

**Why Billing Second**:

- High-risk (money involved), need proven approval queue
- Complex (refund rules, payment processing)
- High impact (billing inquiries take 20+ minutes manually)

**Prerequisites**:

- Operator trust in system established
- Manager approval for financial automation

**Development Effort**:

- Payment API integration: 1 week
- Refund logic and rules: 1 week

**Timeline**:

- Month 9: Development (4-6 weeks)
- Month 10: Pilot with 2-3 technical operators
- Month 11: Full rollout to technical team

**Why Technical Third**:

- Requires specialized knowledge base
- Integration with engineering systems (Jira, GitHub)
- Smaller volume (8% of inquiries) = lower priority than billing

**Prerequisites**:

- Billing agent successful (>60% approval)

- Engineering team alignment

**Development Effort**:

- Technical KB creation: 2 weeks (complex)
- Bug tracking integration: 1 week
- API docs integration: 1 week
- Testing and pilot: 2 weeks

---

### Phase 4: Pre-Sales (Oct 2026+)

**Timeline**:

- Month 12: Development (3-4 weeks)
- Month 13: Pilot with 2 sales-focused operators
- Month 14: Full rollout

**Why Pre-Sales Last**:

- Different goal (conversion vs support)
- Sales team less established than support
- Requires product catalog integration

**Prerequisites**:

- All other agents successful
- Product catalog API complete
- CRM integration (for lead tracking)

**Development Effort**:

- Product catalog integration: 1 week
- Sales KB and playbook: 1 week
- CRM integration: 1 week

---

## Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing

### Shared Knowledge Base

**Common Documents** (all agents use):

- Company policies and values
- Escalation procedures
- Contact information
- Business hours
- General FAQs

**Agent-Specific Documents**:

- Support: Product info, shipping, returns
- Billing: Payment policies, refund rules
- Technical: Troubleshooting, API docs
- Pre-Sales: Product comparisons, pricing, objection handling

**Knowledge Sync Strategy**:

- Weekly KB review meetings
- Cross-agent learnings shared
- Support insights inform sales (e.g., common objections)
- Technical bugs update troubleshooting guides

---

## Agent Routing Logic

### How Customers Get Routed to Right Agent

**Automatic Routing Based on Keywords**:

**Support Agent Keywords**:

- "order", "tracking", "shipping", "delivery", "where is my"

**Billing Agent Keywords**:

- "refund", "charge", "billing", "invoice", "payment failed"

**Technical Agent Keywords**:

- "not working", "error", "crash", "bug", "API", "integration"

**Pre-Sales Agent Keywords**:

- "price", "buy", "compare", "recommend", "demo", "trial"

**Ambiguous Cases**:

- Route to general support by default
- General support can transfer to specialist
- AI suggests transfer: "This looks like a billing question. Transfer to billing team?"

## Cross-Agent Handoff Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Support → Billing

**Trigger**: Customer asks about refund during support conversation

**Current Behavior** (Manual):

- Support operator says: "Let me transfer you to billing team"
- Customer waits in new queue
- Has to re-explain issue

**With Multi-Agent** (Future):

- Support agent clicks "Transfer to Billing"
- Full context passed to billing queue
- Billing agent sees: Previous conversation + customer's refund question
- No re-explaining needed

**Customer Experience**: Seamless, no frustration

---

### Scenario 2: Pre-Sales → Support

**Trigger**: Customer asks about product, then buys, then has shipping question

**Flow**:

- Pre-sales agent helps choose product (converts sale)
- Customer purchases
- 2 days later, asks "Where is my order?"
- Support agent sees previous pre-sales conversation
- Knows customer is new, provides extra care

**Customer Experience**: Feels like one continuous relationship

---
