## Model Overview

**Concept**: Pay per ticket processed (vs flat monthly fee)

**Pricing**: $0.20-0.50 per ticket

**Pros**:

- Fair (pay for what you use)
- Works for variable volume
- Low barrier to entry ($0 upfront)

**Cons**:

- Unpredictable costs (customers hate surprises)
- Incentivizes limiting usage (bad for adoption)
- Complex billing

## Recommendation

**NOT RECOMMENDED for launch**. Stick with flat pricing ($999/$2,499) for predictability.

**Consider for Year 2**: Usage-based as Option 4 for customers with highly variable volume
