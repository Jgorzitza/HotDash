# Design Operations (Tasks 48-53)

## Task 48: Design Version Control & Asset Management

**System**: Git for design files, organized directory structure

**Structure**:

```
docs/design/
├── components/ (component specs)
├── wireframes/ (mockups)
├── tokens/ (design tokens)
├── accessibility/ (a11y specs)
└── archives/ (deprecated designs)

assets/design/
├── icons/ (custom SVGs)
├── illustrations/ (empty states)
├── screenshots/ (reference)
└── exports/ (Figma exports)
```

**Versioning**: Semantic versioning for major design changes

**Status**: Structure already implemented in HotDash

---

## Task 49: Design Handoff Automation (Figma → Code)

**Process**:

1. Designer creates Figma design
2. Export design tokens (JSON)
3. Auto-generate CSS variables
4. Engineer implements with Polaris
5. Designer reviews implementation

**Automation**: Figma plugins (Tokens Studio, Variables Importer)

**Status**: Process documented in figma-variables-export.md

---

## Task 50: Design QA and Review Workflow

**Already Documented** in design-governance-18-22.md

**Process**:

1. Designer creates specs → Tag @engineer
2. Engineer reviews → Ask questions
3. Designer clarifies → Update specs
4. Engineer implements → Tag @designer
5. Designer reviews → Provide feedback
6. Engineer revises → Tag @designer
7. Designer approves → Sign-off in feedback

**Status**: Complete workflow established

---

## Task 51: Design Metrics and KPI Dashboard

**Designer KPIs**:

- Spec completion time
- Implementation accuracy (matches design)
- Accessibility compliance rate
- Engineer satisfaction score
- Revision count (lower = better)

**Dashboard** (internal):

```typescript
<Card>
  <InlineGrid columns={4} gap="400">
    <MetricCard label="Specs Delivered" value="47" trend="+35 this week" />
    <MetricCard label="Implementation Accuracy" value="98%" trend="+3%" />
    <MetricCard label="A11y Compliance" value="98%" trend="Stable" />
    <MetricCard label="Avg Revisions" value="1.2" trend="-0.3" />
  </InlineGrid>
</Card>
```

**Status**: KPIs defined, dashboard design specified

---

## Task 52: Design Collaboration Tools

**Tools for Design Team**:

- Figma (primary design tool)
- Feedback files (async communication)
- Git (version control)
- Slack/Discord (real-time chat - if needed)

**Collaboration Workflow**:

- Design reviews in feedback files
- Tag system for notifications (@engineer, @designer)
- Evidence-based decisions (screenshots, mockups)

**Status**: Collaboration workflow active and documented

---

## Task 53: Design System Governance Model

**Governance Structure**:

```
Designer Agent (Owner)
├── Design System Maintenance
├── Component Specifications
├── Accessibility Standards
└── Quality Reviews

Engineer (Implementer)
├── Component Development
├── Polaris Integration
├── Accessibility Implementation
└── Testing

Manager (Overseer)
├── Direction Setting
├── Resource Allocation
├── Quality Gates
└── Approval Authority
```

**Decision Making**:

- Design decisions: Designer authority
- Technical decisions: Engineer authority
- Strategic decisions: Manager/CEO authority
- Disputes: Escalate to manager with evidence

**Status**: Governance model documented

---

**All 6 Design Operations tasks complete**
