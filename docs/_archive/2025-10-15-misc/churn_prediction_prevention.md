## Churn Prediction Model

**Inputs**:

- Usage decline >30% in 30 days
- Approval rate drop >20%
- Support ticket volume spike (customer frustrated)
- Operator turnover (3+ operators left)
- Negative CSAT trend
- No logins in 14 days

**Output**: Churn probability (0-100%)

**Thresholds**:

- > 70% probability → Urgent intervention (CSM call within 24 hours)
- 40-70% → Proactive outreach (email + phone)
- 20-40% → Monitor closely

## Prevention Tactics

**High Risk (>70%)**:

- Executive outreach (CEO/VP personalized email)
- Offer 3 months free or 50% discount
- Assign dedicated CSM
- Root cause analysis (why churning?)

**Medium Risk (40-70%)**:

- CSM check-in call
- Offer free training or optimization
- Survey: "What can we improve?"

**Target**: Save 30% of at-risk customers (vs 0% without prediction)
