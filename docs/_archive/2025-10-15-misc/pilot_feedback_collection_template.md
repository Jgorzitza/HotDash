## Sample Feedback (From Beta Testing)

**Good Feedback** (Actionable):

- "The bulk approve button is hard to find‚Äîtook me 3 days to discover it"
- "Draft for order #12345 had wrong tracking number‚Äîscreenshot attached"
- "I love the quick templates but wish there was a 'add apology' option"

**Less Useful Feedback**:

- "It's fine" (not specific enough)
- "Doesn't work" (need details: what doesn't work?)
- "I hate it" (need to understand why)

**How to Get Good Feedback**:

- Ask specific questions
- Request examples
- Make it easy (quick polls, not essays)
- Act on feedback quickly (show operators we're listening)
