**Each operator shares** (2 minutes each):

1. **Yesterday's Highlight**: What went well?
   - "I approved 15 drafts and most were spot-on!"
   - "Customer replied saying it was the fastest support they ever got"
   - "I used bulk approve for the first time—love it!"

2. **Yesterday's Lowlight**: What was confusing or frustrating?
   - "3 drafts had wrong order numbers—had to reject"
   - "I couldn't figure out how to edit inline"
   - "Customer was angry but AI draft was too cheerful"

3. **Today's Goal**: What are you hoping for?
   - "Review 20 drafts today (beat my record!)"
   - "Figure out when to use escalate vs reject"
   - "Try the quick templates feature"

---

### Team Discussion (3 minutes)

**Quick hits**:

- Any patterns? (e.g., "4 of us had wrong order number issue")
- Quick wins to celebrate (approval rates improving!)
- Urgent fixes needed? (tag Engineering if critical bug)

---

### Actions & Wrap (2 minutes)

## Sample Standup (From Beta Testing)

**Monday, Oct 28 - Day 1 of Pilot**

**Sarah**: "Highlight: Approved my first draft in 30 seconds! Lowlight: Wasn't sure if I should trust it. Today: Review 10 drafts and get comfortable."

**Marcus**: "Highlight: Dashboard is cool—love seeing my stats. Lowlight: One draft suggested wrong return policy. Today: Beat Sarah's 10 drafts (challenge accepted!)."

**Emily**: "Highlight: Customer thanked me for fast response. Lowlight: Took me 3 minutes per draft (too cautious). Today: Trust more, go faster."

**David**: "Highlight: This is way less boring than manual workflow. Lowlight: Rejected 2 drafts that were fine (I was overthinking). Today: Be more confident."

**Lisa**: "Highlight: Edited a draft to add an emoji and customer loved it. Lowlight: Nothing major. Today: Try bulk approve."

**Action Items**:

- [ ] Engineering: Investigate wrong return policy (Knowledge Base version issue?)
- [ ] Product: Add tip to dashboard: "Trust the AI, you can always reject later"
- [ ] All: Friendly competition for most drafts reviewed (gamification working!)

## Standup Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Don't**: Turn it into a status meeting ("I reviewed 15 drafts yesterday...")
✅ **Do**: Share insights and learnings ("I learned that...")

❌ **Don't**: Complain without suggesting solutions
✅ **Do**: "This was frustrating, maybe we could..."

❌ **Don't**: Hold back honest feedback (worried about hurting feelings)
✅ **Do**: Be direct—we want to know what's broken!

---

## Action Item Tracking
