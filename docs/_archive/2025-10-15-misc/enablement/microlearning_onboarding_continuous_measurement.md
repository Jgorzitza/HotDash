[0:30-4:00] - Content: Demo + explanation
[4:00-4:30] - Recap: "Key takeaways"
[4:30-5:00] - Action: "Try this today"
```

---

### Delivery Method

**Access:**

- Slack #microlearning (one module posted every 2 days)
- Video library in LMS (if/when implemented)
- QR codes on reference cards
- Mobile app (future)

**Schedule:**

```

## PART 4: Training Effectiveness Measurement (Task 2T)

### Measuring Training ROI and Impact

---

### Pre/Post Assessment Framework

**Pre-Training Assessment (Day 0):**

```
Baseline Knowledge Check:
- 10 questions about approval queue, policies, escalation
- Expected score: 30-40% (they haven't been trained yet)
- Purpose: Establish baseline

Baseline Skills Assessment:
- How would you handle these 5 scenarios? (written)
- Expected: Unclear, lots of "I don't know"
- Purpose: Measure skill growth
```

**Post-Training Assessment (Day 5):**

```
Same 10 knowledge questions
Expected score: 80-90% (should improve significantly)

Same 5 scenarios
Expected: Clear decisions with reasoning

Improvement Measurement:
Knowledge: 35% → 85% = 50 percentage point increase
Skills: Uncertain → Confident decisions
```

---

### Performance Improvement Tracking

**Track These Metrics:**

**Week 1 (Baseline):**

```
Operator: ________

Approvals Handled: ___ (with mentor supervision)
Accuracy Rate: ___%
Average Review Time: ___ min
Escalation Rate: ___%
Questions Asked: ___
Confidence Level (self-rated 1-5): ___
```

**Week 4 (Post-Training):**

```
Same metrics tracked independently

Expected Improvements:
- Accuracy: Should be 95%+
- Review Time: Should decrease 30-50%
- Escalation Rate: Should be appropriate (10-15%)
- Questions: Should decrease significantly
- Confidence: Should increase to 4-5/5

Calculate improvement percentages
```

---

### ROI on Training Investment

**Training Cost Calculation:**

```
Investment per operator:

Training Materials Development: $200 (amortized)
Mentor Time (40 hours @ $25/hr): $1,000
Manager Time (10 hours @ $40/hr): $400
Operator Time (40 hours @ $20/hr): $800
Materials (cards, printing): $25

Total Investment: $2,425 per operator
```

**Return Calculation:**

```
Efficiency Gains:
- Pre-training: 20 inquiries/day capacity
- Post-training: 40 inquiries/day capacity (with approval queue)
- Increase: 2× capacity

Quality Gains:
- Pre-training accuracy: 92%
- Post-training accuracy: 98%
- Customer satisfaction improvement: 4.3 → 4.7 (+9%)

Retention Impact:
- Better-trained operators stay longer (lower turnover)
- Estimated retention improvement: 20%
- Reduced re-hiring costs: $3,000 saved per retained operator

First Month Value:
- Operator handles 800 inquiries vs 400 (2× capacity)
- 400 additional inquiries × $15 value = $6,000 additional value
- ROI: $6,000 / $2,425 = 247% first month

Annual ROI: Even higher as benefits compound
```

## PART 4: Training Effectiveness Measurement (Task 2T)

### Comprehensive Measurement Framework

---

### Level 1: Reaction (Did They Like It?)

**Measure:**

```
Post-Training Survey (Day 5):

1. How would you rate the training overall? (1-5)
2. Was the 30-min session helpful? (1-5)
3. Is the Quick Start Guide useful? (1-5)
4. Did practice scenarios build confidence? (1-5)
5. What would improve the training?
6. Would you recommend this training to others?

Target: 4.5+ average rating
```

---

### Level 2: Learning (Did They Learn?)

**Measure:**

```
Knowledge Check Results:

Pre-training average: ~35%
Post-training average: ~85%
Improvement: +50 percentage points

Certification Pass Rate:
Target: 85-90% pass on first attempt
Track: How many needed retake?

Practical Assessment Scores:
Target: 80%+ operators pass supervised approval assessment
```

---

### Level 3: Behavior (Did They Apply It?)

**Measure:**

```
Week 1 vs Week 4 Performance:

Accuracy Rate:
- Week 1: Learning curve (90-95%)
- Week 4: Should be 95-98%

Review Time:
- Week 1: 3-4 min average (learning)
- Week 4: 1.5-2 min average (proficient)

Escalation Appropriateness:
- Week 1: May over-escalate (15-20%)
- Week 4: Should be optimal (10-15%)

Tool Usage:
- Are operators actually using approval queue?
- Or avoiding it and working manually?
- Target: 80%+ of qualifying inquiries go through queue
```

---

### Level 4: Results (Did It Impact Business?)

**Measure:**

```
Business Metrics (Month 1 vs Month 3):

Operator Capacity:
- Baseline: 20-30 inquiries/day
- Post-training: 40-60 inquiries/day
- Target: 2× increase

Customer Satisfaction:
- Baseline CSAT: 4.3
- Post-training: 4.5-4.7
- Target: +5-10% improvement

Response Time:
- Baseline: 4-6 hours
- Post-training: 1-2 hours
- Target: 60-70% reduction

Cost Per Inquiry:
- Baseline: $15
- Post-training: $6-8
- Target: 40-60% reduction
```

---

### Level 5: ROI (Was It Worth It?)

**Calculate:**

```
Training Investment: $2,425 per operator (one-time)

Month 1 Value:
- Capacity increase: 400 additional inquiries handled
- Value per inquiry: $15
- Additional value created: $6,000

ROI Calculation:
$6,000 return / $2,425 investment = 247% ROI in Month 1

Payback Period: <2 weeks

Annual ROI: Much higher as efficiency compounds
```

**Plus Retention Benefits:**

```
Better training → Higher satisfaction → Lower turnover

Average cost to replace operator: $8,000 (recruiting + training + ramp time)

If training improves retention by 20%:
- 10 operators × 20% = 2 fewer departures/year
- 2 × $8,000 = $16,000 saved
- Additional ROI from retention alone
```

---

### Dashboard for Training Metrics

**Track in Real-Time:**

```
TRAINING DASHBOARD (Manager View)

Current Cohort:
├─ Operators in training: 5
├─ Avg progress: Day 3.5/5
├─ Certification readiness: 3/5 ready, 2/5 need more practice
