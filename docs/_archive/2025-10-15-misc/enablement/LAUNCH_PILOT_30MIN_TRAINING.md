# 30-Minute Pilot Training Session - Approval Queue Launch

**Session Type:** Launch Pilot Training  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Target:** Support operators participating in Agent SDK pilot  
**Goal:** Get operators confident enough to start using approval queue

---

## Session Outline

### Part 1: What & Why (5 minutes)

**What is the Approval Queue?**
- AI agents prepare customer responses
- You review and approve/reject
- You're always in control

**Why Are We Doing This?**
- Save time on routine inquiries (order status, policy questions)
- Let you focus on complex issues
- Maintain quality through human review

**What's Your Role?**
- Quality gate: Make sure AI responses are good before sending
- Teacher: Your decisions help AI improve
- Decision-maker: You have final say always

**Key Message:** "This helps you work smarter, not harder. You're the boss, AI is your assistant."

### Part 2: Live Demo (10 minutes)

**Demo 1: Simple Approval** (3 min)

Show on screen:
1. Open approval queue
2. See pending item (order status inquiry)
3. Read customer message: "Where is my order #12345?"
4. Read AI draft: "Hi! Your order #12345 shipped yesterday via FedEx..."
5. Quick check:
   - Accurate? âœ… (verified order info)
   - Answers question? âœ…
   - Tone okay? âœ…
6. Click "Approve & Execute"
7. Show response sent to customer

**Takeaway:** "Most approvals are this simple - quick review, approve, done."

---

**Demo 2: Rejection** (3 min)

Show on screen:
1. See pending item
2. Read customer message: "Can I return after 20 days?"
3. Read AI draft: "Policy is 14 days, sorry you can't return"
4. PROBLEM: Policy is actually 30 days (AI is wrong!)
5. Click "Reject"
6. Add note: "AI cited wrong policy (14 days vs actual 30 days)"
7. Handle manually in Chatwoot with correct policy

**Takeaway:** "Catch AI mistakes - you're the quality check. Reject with notes helps AI learn."

---

**Demo 3: Escalation** (4 min)

Show on screen:
1. See pending item
2. Read customer message: "Charged me twice! $600 total! Calling my bank!"
3. Read AI draft: "Please contact billing..."
4. RED FLAGS:
   - High value ($600)
   - Threats (calling bank = chargeback threat)
   - Needs immediate attention
5. Click "Escalate"
6. Select: "High-Value Issue + Threat"
7. Add notes: Customer details, issue, urgency
8. Submit - manager gets notified immediately

**Takeaway:** "When you see threats, high value, or you're unsure - escalate. That's good judgment."

---

### Part 3: Top 5 FAQ (10 minutes)

**Q1: "What if I approve something wrong?"**

A: Catch it quickly and send a correction in Chatwoot. Document it. We're piloting - mistakes help us learn. No penalty for honest errors.

---

**Q2: "How do I know if AI is accurate?"**

A: Check the "KB Sources" listed. If AI cites "Return Policy v2.1" - click to verify. If confidence score is <70%, review extra carefully. Trust but verify.

---

**Q3: "When should I escalate?"**

A: **Always escalate:**
- Refunds >$100
- Any threats (legal, social media, BBB)
- Technical issues
- You're unsure

**Never escalate:**
- Standard policy applications
- Simple approvals you're confident about

**When in doubt, escalate.** Better safe than sorry.

---

**Q4: "Can I still handle responses manually?"**

A: **Yes!** Approval queue is optional assistance. If you prefer to handle something manually in Chatwoot, go ahead. Use the tool when it helps, skip it when it doesn't.

---

**Q5: "How many approvals will I see per day?"**

A: During pilot: 5-15 per day expected. Takes ~5-10 min total. Rest of your shift is normal Chatwoot work. We're starting small to test the system.

### Part 4: Let's Try It (5 minutes)

**Hands-On:**
- Log into approval queue: `/app/approvals`
- Look at queue (may be empty if no pending)
- Walk through interface together
- Questions while looking at real system

**Practice:**
- "Look at this pending approval - what would you do?"
- Get 2-3 volunteers to talk through their decision
- Coach in real-time
- Build confidence

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways (Repeat at End)

1. **You're in control** - AI suggests, you decide
2. **Keep it simple** - Approve if good, reject if wrong, escalate if unsure
3. **It's a pilot** - We're learning together, feedback welcome
4. **Help available** - Slack, your manager, escalation system
5. **No pressure** - Quality matters more than speed

## ðŸ“‹ Post-Session

**Give Operators:**
- Printed Quick Start Guide (1-page)
- Slack channel for questions (#occ-enablement)
- Manager contact info

**Ask Operators:**
- "Any concerns before we start?"
- "What would make you feel more confident?"

**Follow-Up:**
- Check in after first day using queue
- Weekly feedback sessions during pilot
- Iterate training based on real needs

---

## ðŸš€ Pilot Success Criteria

**After 30 days:**
- 80%+ operators comfortable using queue
- Most feedback is positive or constructive
- No major issues or operator complaints
- System actually helps (not hinders) work

**Then:** Expand training if needed based on what we learned in pilot.
