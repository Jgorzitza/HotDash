## 📊 **Performance Commitments**

### Will Continue Doing
1. ⭐ High-volume execution with quality
2. ⭐ Practical, actionable content
3. ⭐ Fast adaptation to corrections
4. ⭐ Efficient consolidation

### Will Improve
1. ⚠️ Proactive North Star drift detection (flag early)
2. ⚠️ Careful direction reading (catch priority markers)
3. ⚠️ Simplicity over comprehensiveness (default minimal)

### Will Stop
1. 🛑 Building future-state before pilot validation
2. 🛑 Auto-executing without priority confirmation

### Will Recommend
1. 💡 Speed/efficiency as primary training KPI
2. 💡 Train-the-trainer in Week 2 (exponential scaling)
3. 💡 Weekly speed leaderboard (gamification)
