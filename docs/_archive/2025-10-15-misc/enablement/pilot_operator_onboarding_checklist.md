### End-of-Pilot Assessment

7. What additional training would you like?
```

**Usage Metrics:**

- [ ] How many approvals per operator per day?
- [ ] Approval rate (how many approved vs rejected)?
- [ ] Escalation rate (appropriate or over/under escalating)?
- [ ] Time spent per approval?
- [ ] Customer satisfaction impact?

**Decision:**

- [ ] Expand to all operators?
- [ ] Need more training first?
- [ ] What from Tasks 4-42 should we activate?
- [ ] What new training is needed based on evidence?

---

## Success Criteria

**Pilot is Successful If:**

- ✅ 80%+ operators feel confident using queue
- ✅ <5 questions per operator about basics
- ✅ Operators using queue regularly (not avoiding it)
- ✅ Escalations are appropriate (10-15% rate)
- ✅ No major customer issues from pilot
- ✅ Feedback is positive or constructively critical

**Indicates Need for Adjustment:**

- ⚠️ Operators avoiding queue (prefer manual)
- ⚠️ Frequent confusion about basic workflow
- ⚠️ Over-escalating (>20%) or under-escalating (<5%)
- ⚠️ Requests for "more comprehensive training"
- ⚠️ Technical issues blocking usage

---

## Evidence Collection

**Document Everything:**

- [ ] Operator questions (type, frequency)
- [ ] Technical issues (what, when, resolved how)
- [ ] Feedback themes (what's working, what's not)
- [ ] Usage patterns (time of day, volume)
- [ ] Escalation patterns (appropriate or not)

**Use Evidence To:**

- Determine if Quick Start Guide needs updates
- Decide if additional training needed
- Identify which paused materials (Tasks 4-42) to activate
- Plan post-pilot expansion

---

## Post-Pilot Next Steps (Evidence-Based)

**If Pilot is Successful:**

- [ ] Expand to all operators (schedule training sessions)
- [ ] Activate needed materials from Tasks 4-42
- [ ] Create any additional training based on feedback
- [ ] Plan full rollout

**If Pilot Needs Adjustment:**

- [ ] Extend pilot period
- [ ] Add targeted training for confusion points
- [ ] Fix technical issues
- [ ] Iterate on Quick Start Guide
- [ ] Re-assess before expanding
