- ‚úÖ Give specific, actionable feedback
- ‚úÖ Be patient (everyone learns at different pace)
- ‚úÖ Encourage questions (no "stupid questions")

**DON'T:**

- ‚ùå Just tell them the answer without explaining
- ‚ùå Criticize mistakes harshly
- ‚ùå Expect perfection immediately
- ‚ùå Compare to other new hires
- ‚ùå Rush through topics
- ‚ùå Make them feel bad for not knowing
- ‚ùå Take over instead of coaching

**Feedback Formula:**

```
"I noticed you [specific observation].
That works because [explain positive] OR
Next time, try [specific suggestion] because [explain why].
Overall, [encouragement]."

Example:
"I noticed you added the customer's name and a warm greeting to that draft.
That works great because it personalizes the response and builds rapport.
Overall, you're getting really good at improving AI tone!"
```

- **Mentor Support:** "This is normal, you're doing great"
- **References:** You don't need to memorize, just know where to look

**Manager/Mentor:**

FAQs, and support. Your job is to know where to find answers, not memorize them all."

you should be. Give yourself credit for how far you've come."
