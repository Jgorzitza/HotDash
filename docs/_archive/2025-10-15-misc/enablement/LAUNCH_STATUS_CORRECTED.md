**File:** `LAUNCH_PILOT_30MIN_TRAINING.md`  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Use For:** Live training before pilot starts

**Content:**
- What & Why (5 min)
- Live Demo: Approve, Reject, Escalate (10 min)
- Top 5 FAQ (10 min)
- Hands-on interface tour (5 min)

## ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED (Post-Launch - Don't Use Yet)**

**Created But Waiting for Pilot Evidence:**

### Comprehensive Materials (Tasks 4-42)
All these materials exist but are **paused per manager direction** until after pilot:

- ‚ùå Approval Queue FAQ (40 questions) - **Too comprehensive for pilot**
- ‚ùå Internal Dry-Run Session (90 min) - **Too long for pilot**
- ‚ùå Advanced Training Modules (70K words) - **Beyond pilot scope**
- ‚ùå All Tasks 7-42 (learning systems, KB systems, delivery systems) - **Future-state**

**Status:** Available in `/docs/enablement/` but **not for distribution yet**

**Rationale:** 
- North Star: "Evidence or no merge"
- Pilot first, learn what operators actually need
- Build training based on real feedback, not assumptions
- Minimal viable training ‚Üí Launch ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Iterate

## üìã **Launch Pilot Checklist**

### Pre-Launch (This Week)
- [x] Task 1: Video modules complete
- [x] Task 2: Quick Start Guide created (minimal)
- [x] Task 3: 30-min training session outlined (minimal)
- [ ] Print Quick Start Guide (1 page per operator)
- [ ] Schedule 30-min training session
- [ ] Identify pilot operators (5-10 recommended)

### Launch Week
- [ ] Conduct 30-min training session
- [ ] Distribute printed Quick Start Guide
- [ ] Operators begin using approval queue (5-15/day)
- [ ] Daily check-ins with operators
- [ ] Log issues and feedback in real-time

### Pilot Period (2-4 Weeks)
- [ ] Monitor operator usage and comfort
- [ ] Collect feedback (what's confusing? what's helpful?)
- [ ] Track metrics (approval rate, escalation rate, operator satisfaction)
- [ ] Identify training gaps (what additional support is needed?)

### Post-Pilot
- [ ] Analyze pilot results and operator feedback
- [ ] Determine which paused materials (Tasks 4-42) are actually needed
- [ ] Create targeted training based on evidence
- [ ] Iterate on Quick Start and 30-min session based on learnings

## üéØ **Pilot Training Philosophy**

### Minimal Viable Training
**Principle:** Give operators just enough to start safely, then learn from real usage

**Includes:**
- ‚úÖ Basic understanding (what it is, why we're doing it)
- ‚úÖ Core workflow (approve, reject, escalate)
- ‚úÖ Safety guardrails (always escalate list)
- ‚úÖ How to get help (contacts and resources)

**Excludes (Until After Pilot):**
- ‚ùå Comprehensive frameworks (may be overkill)
- ‚ùå Advanced techniques (learn basics first)
- ‚ùå Elaborate systems (build if pilot shows need)
- ‚ùå Future-state planning (focus on now)

---

## üìä **Success Metrics for Pilot**

**During Pilot (2-4 weeks):**
- Operators feel confident enough to use queue
- No major errors or customer issues
- Feedback is mostly positive or constructive
- Clear understanding of when to escalate

**Indicates Training is Adequate If:**
- <5 questions per operator about basics
- Operators using queue without constant support
- Escalations are appropriate (not over/under escalating)
- No complaints about inadequate training

**Indicates Need for More Training If:**
- Frequent confusion about basic workflow
- Operators avoiding queue (prefer manual)
- Inappropriate escalations or decisions
- Requests for "more comprehensive guide"

---

## üîÑ **Evidence-Based Iteration Plan**

**After Pilot Week 1:**
- Review operator questions
- Identify top 3 confusion points
- Update Quick Start Guide with clarifications
- Add to FAQ if needed (but keep it short)

**After Pilot Week 2:**
- Assess if 30-min training was sufficient
- Determine if follow-up session needed
- Check if operators want more depth on specific topics
- Create targeted materials only if evidence shows need

**After Pilot Completion:**
- Comprehensive feedback review
- Decide which Tasks 4-42 materials to activate
- Build only what pilot evidence shows is needed
- Continue evidence-based approach

## üí° **Key Insight**

**What I Learned:**
The 42-task expansion was future-state roadmap, not immediate launch requirements. I should have recognized this and flagged:

"Manager, these 42 tasks seem comprehensive but beyond pilot launch needs. Should I focus on minimal Tasks 2-3 for pilot, then revisit Tasks 4-42 post-launch based on evidence from pilot usage?"

**North Star Principle Applied:**
"Evidence or no merge" = Don't build elaborate systems before validating with real usage. Launch minimal, learn from evidence, iterate based on data.

## üìÅ **Current Enablement Inventory**

**ACTIVE (Use for Launch):**
1. LAUNCH_PILOT_QUICK_START.md (1 page)
2. LAUNCH_PILOT_30MIN_TRAINING.md (30-min outline)
3. 4 Loom modules (18m 25s) - optional pre-training

**PAUSED (Available but not distributing until pilot evidence):**
- All other comprehensive materials (Tasks 4-42)
- Can be activated if pilot shows need
- Evidence-based activation decisions

## ‚úÖ **Corrected Alignment with North Star**

**Before:** Build comprehensive future-state training ecosystem
**After:** Minimal pilot training ‚Üí Launch ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Evidence-based iteration ‚úÖ

**Manager Direction Followed:**
- ‚úÖ Task 2-3: Created (minimal for launch)
- ‚úÖ Tasks 4-42: Paused until after launch
- ‚úÖ Evidence-based approach adopted
- ‚úÖ North Star alignment restored

**Status**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR PILOT LAUNCH WITH MINIMAL TRAINING**

**Next:** Launch pilot, collect evidence, iterate based on real operator needs.

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-11T20:30:00Z
**Correction**: Manager-directed North Star realignment
**Outcome**: ‚úÖ Minimal pilot training complete, comprehensive materials paused
**Commitment**: Flag drift proactively in future

**üöÄ PILOT LAUNCH: GO with minimal training (evidence-based approach)** ‚úÖ
