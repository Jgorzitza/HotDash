## Task 29: Virtual Instructor-Led Training (VILT)

### VILT Program Design

**Purpose:** Live, interactive remote training sessions for distributed operator teams

---

### VILT Session Structure

**Session 1: Agent SDK Approval Queue Fundamentals** (90 min)

```
AGENDA:
00:00-00:10: Welcome, introductions, session goals
00:10-00:30: Agent SDK overview (presentation + live demo)

01:30-02:00: Hands-on practice (breakout rooms)
02:00-02:20: Group discussion and Q&A
02:20-02:30: Recap and next steps

INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
‚îú‚îÄ Live polls ("What would you do?" scenarios)
‚îú‚îÄ Breakout rooms (pairs practice together)
‚îú‚îÄ Chat questions (answered throughout)
‚îú‚îÄ Screen sharing (operators show their screens)
‚îî‚îÄ Collaborative whiteboard (build framework together)

TECH REQUIREMENTS:
‚îú‚îÄ Zoom or Teams (breakout room capability)
‚îú‚îÄ Poll integration (Slido, Zoom Polls)
‚îú‚îÄ Screen sharing enabled for all
‚îú‚îÄ Recording for operators who miss live session
‚îî‚îÄ Chat moderation (co-facilitator)

FACILITATOR TEAM:
‚îú‚îÄ Primary Facilitator: Enablement Lead
‚îú‚îÄ Co-Facilitator: Support Manager (demos, Q&A)
‚îú‚îÄ Tech Support: Engineering (troubleshooting)
‚îî‚îÄ Chat Moderator: Senior Operator (answer questions)
```

---

**Session 2: Advanced Escalation & Complex Scenarios** (60 min)

```
TARGET: Operators with 2+ weeks experience

- 15 minutes to analyze and decide
- Create escalation notes together
- Present to full group
- Get expert feedback

```

---

### VILT Best Practices

**Engagement Techniques:**

- ‚úÖ Poll every 10 minutes (maintain attention)
- ‚úÖ Breakout rooms for practice (active learning)
- ‚úÖ Chat interaction (questions welcome anytime)
- ‚úÖ Real examples (not just theory)
- ‚úÖ Record for replay (accommodate schedules)

**Avoid:**

- ‚ùå Lecture for 90 minutes straight (boring!)
- ‚ùå No interaction (passive = low retention)
- ‚ùå Too many attendees (>20 = hard to engage)
- ‚ùå Technical issues (test beforehand!)
- ‚ùå No follow-up (send recap + resources after)

---

---

**Hands-On Practice (20% of learning):**

- Supervised approvals (real work with mentor)

**When to Use:** Skill development, confidence building, application

---

**Peer/Social Learning (10% of learning):**
