- Present to full group
- Get expert feedback

Result: Collaborative learning + multiple perspectives
```

---

### VILT Best Practices

**Engagement Techniques:**

- ✅ Poll every 10 minutes (maintain attention)
- ✅ Breakout rooms for practice (active learning)
- ✅ Chat interaction (questions welcome anytime)
- ✅ Real examples (not just theory)
- ✅ Record for replay (accommodate schedules)

**Avoid:**

- ❌ Lecture for 90 minutes straight (boring!)
- ❌ No interaction (passive = low retention)
- ❌ Too many attendees (>20 = hard to engage)
- ❌ Technical issues (test beforehand!)
- ❌ No follow-up (send recap + resources after)

├─ No interruptions: Protected time respected
└─ Tracked: Managers ensure operators use it

MESSAGE: "Learning isn't extra - it's essential"
```

```
KNOWLEDGE SHARING EXPECTED:
