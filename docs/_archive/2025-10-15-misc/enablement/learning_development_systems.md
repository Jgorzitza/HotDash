□ Communication assessment: [Score]/5

GOALS:
□ Primary goal: [ ] Speed [ ] Quality [ ] Career growth
□ Interest in: [ ] Mentoring [ ] Expert certification [ ] Leadership
□ Time available for learning: [Hours/week]

RESULT: Custom learning path generated
```

---

**Step 2: Path Generation**

**Path A: Experienced Support → Fast Track**

```
Profile: 3+ years support experience, high baseline scores

Recommended Path:
Week 1: Foundation modules (condensed - 10 modules, skip basics)
Week 2: Jump to Skill Builders (focus on AI collaboration)
Week 3: Advanced Mastery modules
Week 4: Certification

Total Time: 3 hours vs 5 hours standard path
Completion: Day 21 vs Day 30
```

**Path B: New to Support → Comprehensive**

```
Profile: No support experience, lower baseline scores

Recommended Path:
Week 1-2: All Foundation modules (20 modules, gradual pace)
Week 3-4: Skill Builders with mentorship
Week 5-6: Practical application focus
Week 7: Advanced introduction
Week 8: Certification

Total Time: 7 hours vs 5 hours standard
Completion: Day 56 vs Day 30 (extended for thoroughness)
```

**Path C: Career Growth Focus → Leadership Track**

```
Profile: Competent operator interested in advancement

Recommended Path:
Month 1: Advanced modules (expert techniques)
Month 2: Mentorship training + practice
Month 3: Training contribution + system optimization
Month 4: Expert certification + leadership development

Total Time: 15 hours over 4 months
Result: Expert Operator + leadership pipeline
```

---

### Dynamic Path Adjustment

**Continuous Adaptation:**

```
IF operator_score > 95% on module THEN
    → Skip next beginner module
    → Suggest advanced module instead
    → Accelerate timeline

IF operator_score < 70% on topic THEN
    → Add remedial module
    → Slow down progression
    → Trigger mentor check-in

IF operator completes modules 2× faster than average THEN
    → Suggest advanced path
    → Offer expert track early
    → Consider for mentorship

IF operator struggles with specific skill area THEN
    → Add focused practice modules
    → Assign peer mentor strong in that area
    → Extend practice period
```

**Result:** Path adapts to operator's actual performance, not predetermined schedule

**Philosophy:** The best way to learn is to teach others

**Structure:**

**Component 1: Peer Learning Pods (3-4 operators each)**

```
WEEKLY POD MEETINGS (30 minutes):

Week Rotation:
├─ Week 1: Case Study Review (share interesting approvals)
├─ Week 2: Skill Sharing (one person teaches technique)
├─ Week 3: Problem Solving (bring challenges, get advice)
└─ Week 4: Best Practice Exchange (what's working well)

Pod Composition:
├─ Mixed experience levels (1 expert, 2 proficient, 1 newer)
├─ Complementary strengths (speed expert + quality expert)
└─ Compatible schedules (same shift if possible)

Facilitation:
├─ Rotate facilitator weekly
├─ Structured agenda (keeps 30 min)
├─ Action items captured
└─ Share learnings with full team monthly
```

---

**Component 2: Teach-to-Learn Sessions**

**Concept:** Want to master a topic? Teach it to someone else

**Process:**

1. **Operator volunteers** to lead session on a topic
2. **Prepares 15-minute presentation** (structured template)
3. **Teaches team** in weekly knowledge sharing
4. **Gets feedback** and recognition
5. **Deepens own mastery** through teaching

**Benefits:**

- Teacher: Deepest learning possible

└─ Total Year 1: $22,250

TRAINING BENEFIT:
├─ Faster competency: 30 days vs 60 days = 30 days savings/operator
│   └─ 30 days × 50 operators × $200/day = $300,000
├─ Higher CSAT: 4.7 vs 4.3 = 9% improvement
│   └─ Customer retention impact = ~$50,000/year
├─ Reduced errors: 98% vs 92% accuracy = 6% fewer errors
│   └─ Error cost savings = ~$25,000/year
├─ Better retention: Trained operators stay longer
│   └─ Turnover cost savings = ~$40,000/year
└─ Total Year 1 Benefit: $415,000

ROI CALCULATION:
($415,000 - $22,250) / $22,250 = 17.6× return
or 1,760% ROI

CONCLUSION: Training investment pays for itself 17× over in Year 1
