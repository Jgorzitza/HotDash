C) Reject with note that policy version is wrong

D) Escalate immediately to manager

### Question 6

**Customer asks for a $75 refund. AI's draft explains the refund process correctly. What should you do?**

A) Approve - refunds under $100 are your authority

C) Reject - you should offer store credit instead  
D) Edit to reduce refund amount

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**A) Approve - refunds under $100 are your authority**

**Why:** Operators can approve refunds up to $100. This is within your authority.

## Hands-On Practice Assessment (Optional)

**If time allows after quiz:**

**Present 3 Quick Scenarios:**

**Scenario A:**
Customer: "Where is order #123?"  
AI Draft: "Hi! Order #123 shipped yesterday. Tracking: [link]. Arrives Tuesday."  
**Your Decision:** Approve / Reject / Escalate?

**Scenario B:**
Customer: "Can I return this after 35 days?"  
AI Draft: "Policy is 14 days, sorry we can't accept returns."  
**Your Decision:** Approve / Reject / Escalate?
_(Hint: Policy is actually 30 days, AI is wrong)_

**Scenario C:**
Customer: "Charged me 3 times! $900! Calling my bank!"  
AI Draft: "Please contact billing..."  
**Your Decision:** Approve / Reject / Escalate?
_(Hint: Threats + high value = escalate)_

**Expected:**

- Scenario A: Approve
- Scenario B: Reject (wrong policy)
- Scenario C: Escalate (threats + high value)

**If operator gets all 3 right:** Excellent! Ready to go.  
**If operator struggles:** Quick coaching on decision criteria.

## Evidence-Based Next Steps

**Use Assessment Data To:**

1. **Validate Training Adequacy:**
   - If 80%+ operators confident → Training is sufficient
   - If <80% confident → Need more/better training

2. **Identify Training Gaps:**
   - Questions 6-7 tell us what's missing
   - Build targeted content based on real needs

3. **Decide on Expansion:**
   - If pilot successful → Activate needed materials from Tasks 4-42
   - If needs work → Iterate before expanding

4. **Plan Future Training:**
   - What from comprehensive materials (Tasks 4-42) is actually needed?
   - What new materials do we need based on pilot learnings?
   - Evidence-based decisions only
