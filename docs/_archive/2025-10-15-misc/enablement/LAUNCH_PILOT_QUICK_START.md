## 🎯 What You Need to Know (5 Minutes)

### What is the Approval Queue?

AI agents prepare customer responses. You review and decide: **Approve or Reject**.

**That's it.** You're always in control.

---

## ⚡ How to Approve/Reject (30 Seconds)

**Approve When:**
- ✅ Information is accurate
- ✅ Tone is professional and friendly
- ✅ Answers the customer's question

**Click:** `Approve & Execute`

---

**Reject When:**
- ❌ Information is wrong
- ❌ Doesn't answer customer's question
- ❌ Tone is inappropriate

**Click:** `Reject` → Add quick note why → Handle manually in Chatwoot

---

## 🚨 Always Escalate

**If you see ANY of these, escalate immediately:**

- 💰 **Refunds >$100**
- 😠 **Customer threatens legal action, social media, or BBB**
- 🔧 **Technical/system errors**
- ❓ **You're unsure**

**How:** Click `Escalate` → Select reason → Submit

**SLA:** Urgent issues (threats) = 15 minutes, others = 2-4 hours

---

## 📋 Quick Decision Checklist

**Before clicking Approve:**
```
□ Read customer's original message
□ Read AI's draft response
□ Check: Is information accurate?
