## Usage & Analytics

### Engagement Metrics

**Track Per Module:**

- Views / completions
- Average time spent
- Completion rate (started → finished)
- Rating (helpful / not helpful)
- Comments and questions

**Track Per Operator:**

- Total modules completed
- Completion rate over time
- Learning path progress
- Time invested in learning
- Performance correlation (does learning → better metrics?)

**Track Overall:**

- Most popular modules
- Least engaged modules (candidates for improvement)
- Average completion rate by module category
- Drop-off patterns (where operators quit)

---

### Effectiveness Measurement

**Question:** Does microlearning work?

**Measure:**

1. **Knowledge Retention** (Quiz 1 week after module)
   - Target: 80%+ retention
   - Compare to traditional training

2. **Behavior Change** (Observe apply in work)
   - Are operators using techniques learned?
   - Spot-check for application

3. **Performance Improvement** (Metrics before/after)
   - Does "90-Second Review" module → faster review times?
   - Does "Empathy" module → higher CSAT?

4. **Operator Satisfaction**
   - Microlearning helpfulness rating
   - Preference vs long training sessions
   - Engagement and completion rates

**ROI Calculation:**

```
Time Investment: 5 min per module × 60 modules = 5 hours total
Performance Gain: [Measure improvement in key metrics]
Engagement: [Completion rates vs traditional training]

Result: Microlearning effective if:
- 70%+ completion rate (vs 50% for long courses)
- 80%+ knowledge retention (vs 30% for long courses)
- Measurable performance improvement
```
