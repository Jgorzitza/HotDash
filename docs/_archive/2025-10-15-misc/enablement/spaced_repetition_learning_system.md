## The Science of Forgetting

### Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve

**Research Finding:** Without reinforcement, people forget:

- **20 minutes:** 42% forgotten
- **1 day:** 67% forgotten
- **7 days:** 75% forgotten
- **30 days:** 79% forgotten

**Problem for Operator Training:**
30-day onboarding → Operators forget 79% within a month if no reinforcement!

**Solution:** Spaced repetition = review at optimal intervals = 90%+ retention

---

### How Spaced Repetition Works

**Principle:** Review information just before you're about to forget it

**Timeline:**

```
Initial Learning (Day 0)
    ↓
First Review (Day 1) ← Review before 67% forgotten
    ↓
Second Review (Day 3) ← Retention strengthens
    ↓
Third Review (Day 7) ← Longer interval possible
    ↓
Fourth Review (Day 14) ← Information moving to long-term memory
    ↓
Fifth Review (Day 30) ← Nearly permanent retention
    ↓
Periodic Reviews (Every 90 days) ← Maintenance
```

**Result:** 90%+ retention vs 21% retention without reviews

---

## Spaced Repetition Principles

### Core Principles

**1. Optimal Timing**
Review just before forgetting (not too early, not too late)

**2. Progressive Intervals**
Each successful review → longer next interval  
Struggle to recall → shorter next interval

**3. Active Recall**
Test yourself (don't just re-read)  
Retrieval practice strengthens memory

**4. Interleaving**
Mix topics (don't review all of Topic A, then all of Topic B)  
Forced discrimination strengthens learning

**5. Difficulty Adjustment**
Easy recall → longer interval  
Hard recall → shorter interval  
Failed recall → restart cycle

### Customized Schedules by Content Type

**High-Priority Content (Critical for Safety/Accuracy):**

```
Examples: Escalation procedures, red flags, policy authority

Day 0 → Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 14 → Day 30 → Monthly
        (Review 6 times in first month)
```

**Medium-Priority Content (Important for Performance):**

```
Examples: Efficiency techniques, quality skills

Day 0 → Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 21 → Day 60 → Quarterly
        (Review 4 times in first 2 months)
```

**Low-Priority Content (Nice-to-Know):**

```
Examples: Advanced techniques, system optimization

Day 0 → Day 7 → Day 30 → Quarterly
        (Review 3 times in first month, then maintenance)
```

---

## Review Schedule Design

### Operator-Specific Dynamic Scheduling

**Concept:** Adjust review schedule based on individual performance

**If Operator Aces Review (100% correct):**
→ Extend next interval by 50%  
Example: Day 1 → Day 3 becomes Day 1 → Day 4.5

**If Operator Struggles (60-79% correct):**
→ Keep interval the same  
Example: Day 1 → Day 3 stays Day 1 → Day 3

**If Operator Fails Review (<60% correct):**
→ Shorten next interval by 50%  
Example: Day 3 → Day 7 becomes Day 3 → Day 5

**Personalized Result:** Each operator gets optimal review timing for THEIR learning curve

---

### Topic-Based Difficulty Adjustment

**Track Per Topic:**

- Operator success rate on topic
- Identify challenging vs easy topics
- Adjust review frequency accordingly

**Example:**

```
Topic: "Escalation Procedures"
- Sarah: 95% success → Review every 14 days
- Mike: 70% success → Review every 7 days
- Lisa: 50% success → Review every 3 days + coaching

Result: Each operator masters at their own pace
```

### Review Content Examples

**Day 1 Review: 5-Question Framework**

```
QUICK QUIZ (5 minutes):

1. What are the 5 questions in the decision framework?
   [Fill in the blank]

2. Which question addresses whether the customer will understand the response?
   A) Accuracy  B) Completeness  C) Clarity  D) Risk

3. If a response has accurate information but robotic tone, what should you do?
   A) Approve  B) Edit & Approve  C) Reject  D) Escalate

4. High confidence (95%) but customer is threatening legal action. What do you do?
   A) Trust the AI and approve
   B) Escalate immediately regardless of confidence
   C) Edit to address the threat
   D) Reject the draft

[8-10 total questions, ~5 minutes]

RESULT:
✅ 9/10 correct: Great! Next review in 3 days.
⚠️ 7/10 correct: Review the framework again, next review in 2 days.
❌ <6/10 correct: Let's schedule a 15-minute refresher with your mentor.
```

---

**Day 3 Review: Escalation Decision-Making**

```
SCENARIO DECISION (7 minutes):

Scenario:
Customer ordered item 45 days ago, requests return exception. Item unused with tags.
Customer has 10 previous orders totaling $1,200. Polite tone.

AI Draft (82% confidence):
"Our policy is 30 days. Your order is outside this window..."

Your Decision:
A) Approve AI draft (policy is clear)
B) Edit to make it more empathetic
C) Reject and offer store credit instead
D) Escalate for manager policy exception decision

[Make decision, then see analysis]

EXPERT ANALYSIS:
Correct: D) Escalate
Why: Policy exceptions >30 days require manager approval. Your job is to
recommend (approval likely given customer value), but manager decides.

What you'd include in escalation:
- Customer loyalty (10 orders, $1.2K)
- Valid unused condition
- Only 15 days over
- Polite approach
- Recommendation: Approve exception

DID YOU:
☐ Choose escalate? Great judgment!
☐ Choose B or C? Close - but policy exceptions need approval regardless of how you phrase it
☐ Choose A? Review escalation matrix - this needs manager sign-off

Next Review: Day 7
```

**Combine Both Systems:**

1. **Complete Microlearning Module** (Day 0)
   - Learn new skill in 5 minutes

2. **Spaced Reviews** (Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 30)
   - Quick reinforcement of that specific skill
   - Each review builds on the last

3. **Application in Work**
   - Use skill in real approvals
   - Practical reinforcement

4. **Mastery Achievement**
   - After 30 days: Skill internalized
   - Becomes automatic/instinctive

**Example: "Adding Empathy" Skill**

```
Day 0: Complete Module S-12 "Empathy in 3 Seconds" (5 min)
Day 1: Quiz - 5 questions about empathy techniques (3 min)
Day 3: Scenario - Add empathy to 3 robotic drafts (5 min)
Day 7: Real work - Submit 3 examples where you added empathy (self-paced)
Day 14: Peer review - Discuss empathy strategies with another operator (10 min)
Day 30: Assessment - Empathy skill integrated into certification exam

Result: Empathy becomes natural part of your editing approach
```

Total Time Investment:
- First 30 days: 52 minutes review (massive retention gain)
- First year: 72 minutes review total

Return: 90%+ retention vs 21% without reviews
```

---

### Topic-Specific Schedules

**Critical Topics (More Frequent Reviews):**

**Escalation Procedures:**

```
Day 0 → Day 1 → Day 2 → Day 4 → Day 7 → Day 14 → Day 30
(6 reviews in 30 days - critical safety topic)
```

**5-Question Framework:**

```
Day 0 → Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 14 → Day 30
(5 reviews in 30 days - foundational skill)
```

**Standard Topics (Normal Schedule):**

**Confidence Scores, KB Verification:**

```
Day 0 → Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 30
(4 reviews in 30 days - important but less critical)
```

**Advanced Topics (Lighter Schedule):**

**Expert Techniques, Optimization:**

```
Day 0 → Day 7 → Day 30 → Day 90
(3 reviews only - for experienced operators)
```

---

## Content Reinforcement Strategy

### Review Content Design

**Principle:** Don't just repeat - VARY the retrieval practice

**Day 1 Review:**

```
Format: Direct recall
Question: "What are the 5 questions in the decision framework?"
[Operator types from memory]

Difficulty: Easy
Purpose: Basic recall, prevent initial forgetting
```

**Day 3 Review:**

```
Format: Application
Scenario: "Customer frustrated about delay. AI draft lacks empathy. Which framework question failed?"
A) Accuracy  B) Completeness  C) Tone  D) Risk

Difficulty: Medium
Purpose: Apply knowledge to scenarios
```

**Day 7 Review:**

```
Format: Analysis
Scenario: [Complex approval with multiple issues]
Task: "Identify which of the 5 questions pass or fail, then make a decision."
[Operator provides reasoning]

Difficulty: Hard
Purpose: Deep processing, strengthen retention
```

**Day 14 Review:**

```
Format: Real-world application
Task: "Submit 3 examples from your real work this week where you applied the 5-Question Framework."
[Operator provides actual approvals]

Difficulty: Application
Purpose: Connect theory to practice
```

---

### Interleaving Strategy

**Don't Review Topics in Blocks:**

**Bad:**

- Day 1: All escalation questions
- Day 3: All framework questions
- Day 7: All policy questions

**Good (Interleaved):**

- Day 1: Mix of escalation, framework, policy
- Day 3: Different mix of same topics
- Day 7: Another mix

**Why:** Forces brain to discriminate between topics, strengthens learning

**Example Day 1 Quiz (Interleaved):**

```
Q1: Framework question
Q2: Escalation question
Q3: Policy question
Q4: Framework question
Q5: Confidence score question
Q6: Escalation question
Q7: Framework question
Q8: Policy question
Q9: AI collaboration question
Q10: Framework question

Result: Brain works harder, remembers better
```

---

## Technology & Automation

### Slack Bot Implementation (Recommended MVP)

**Slack Bot Features:**

**1. Automatic Review Reminders**

```
SlackBot: "Hi [Name]! Time for your Day 3 review - 7 minutes 🎯"

[Start Review] button → Opens review in Slack or web

SlackBot: "Complete by end of shift for optimal retention!"
```

**2. Quick Quizzes in Slack**

```
SlackBot: "Question 1/10: What are the 5 questions..."

Operator: [Types answer or clicks multiple choice]

SlackBot: "✅ Correct! The 5-Question Framework is..."

[Continues through 10 questions]

SlackBot: "You got 9/10! Excellent! 🎉 Next review: Oct 18"
```

**3. Progress Tracking**

```
SlackBot: "/learning-progress"

Your Learning Progress:
├─ Framework: 100% mastered ✅
├─ Escalation: 80% (review scheduled Oct 18)
├─ Policies: 90% ✅
└─ AI Collaboration: 70% (needs more practice)

Next Review: Tomorrow (Escalation topic)
Streak: 7 days consecutive reviews 🔥
```

**4. Gamification Elements**

```
SlackBot: "🔥 7-day review streak! Keep it up!"
SlackBot: "🏆 Achievement Unlocked: Framework Master"
SlackBot: "📈 You're in the top 20% for retention this month!"
```

---

### Review Scheduling Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```python
def calculate_next_review(operator, topic, score):
    """Calculate optimal next review date based on performance"""

    # Get current interval for this topic and review number
    current_interval = get_interval(topic, review_number)

    # Adjust based on score
    if score >= 90:  # Aced it
        next_interval = current_interval * 1.5  # Extend 50%
    elif score >= 70:  # Good performance
        next_interval = current_interval  # Keep same
    else:  # Struggled
        next_interval = current_interval * 0.5  # Shorten 50%

    # Calculate next review date
    next_review_date = last_review_date + next_interval

    # Save to operator profile
    save_next_review(operator, topic, next_review_date, next_interval)

    return next_review_date

def get_interval(topic, review_number):
    """Standard intervals by priority"""

    if topic.priority == "critical":
        intervals = [1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 30]  # days
    elif topic.priority == "high":
        intervals = [1, 3, 7, 14, 30]
    elif topic.priority == "medium":
        intervals = [3, 7, 21, 60]
    else:  # low priority
        intervals = [7, 30, 90]

    return intervals[review_number]
```

---

## Measurement & Optimization
