**Layer 2: Metadata & Indexing (Supabase Tables)**

```sql
-- Knowledge Base Articles Table
CREATE TABLE kb_articles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    subcategory TEXT,
    version TEXT NOT NULL,  -- e.g., "2.1.0"

├─ Each KB article converted to vector embedding
├─ Semantic search (find by meaning, not just keywords)
├─ Relevance ranking (most relevant first)
└─ Context-aware retrieval

INTEGRATION WITH AGENT SDK:
├─ AI queries KB for draft responses
├─ Returns top 5 relevant articles with scores
├─ Operators verify sources in approval queue
└─ Feedback loop improves search relevance
```

---

**Layer 4: Knowledge Access (APIs & UI)**

```
ACCESS METHODS:

1. Operator Search Interface
   ├─ Quick search bar (autocomplete)
   ├─ Advanced filters (category, version, date)
   └─ Browse by category

2. AI Agent Access (LlamaIndex API)
   ├─ Semantic search
   ├─ Context-aware retrieval
   └─ Relevance scoring

3. Approval Queue Integration
   ├─ KB sources linked in approval cards
   ├─ One-click verification
   └─ Version checking

4. Mobile App (Future)
   ├─ Quick search
   ├─ Offline cached articles
   └─ Bookmark favorites
```

---

## Task 22: Knowledge Capture Automation

### Automated Knowledge Capture from Operator Work

**Purpose:** Turn operator expertise and experiences into KB articles automatically

---

### Capture Method 1: Escalation Mining

**Process:**

```
1. Operator escalates complex case
    ↓
2. Manager resolves and documents resolution
    ↓
3. System identifies if this is a pattern (3+ similar escalations)
    ↓
4. Auto-generates KB article draft:
   - Title: "How to Handle [Issue Type]"
   - Content: Pattern from escalations + resolution
   - Category: Auto-tagged based on escalation type
    ↓
5. Enablement team reviews and publishes
    ↓
6. Future similar cases: AI can handle (no escalation needed)

EXAMPLE:
3 escalations about "Return after 35-40 days with travel excuse"
    ↓
System generates: "Policy Exception: Extended Returns for Travel"
    ↓
Includes: Decision criteria, customer value thresholds, approval process
    ↓
Future operators: KB article guides decision
```

---

### Capture Method 2: Rejection Note Analysis

**Process:**

```
1. Operator rejects AI draft with notes:
   "AI cited 14-day return policy but current is 30 days"
    ↓
2. System flags: Policy error pattern
    ↓
3. Checks if KB has correct version indexed
    ↓
4. Auto-creates improvement task:
   "Update KB index to prioritize Return Policy v2.1"
    ↓
5. KB team fixes indexing
    ↓
6. Future drafts: Use correct policy

PATTERN DETECTION:
5+ similar rejection notes = KB gap or error
    ↓
Auto-generate KB improvement ticket
    ↓
Enablement team addresses
```

---

### Capture Method 3: Edit Pattern Recognition

**Process:**

```
Operator consistently adds "I'm sorry" to product damage responses
    ↓
System detects edit pattern (20+ similar edits)
    ↓
Auto-suggests KB article:
"Best Practice: Empathy Phrases for Product Issues"
    ↓
Operator who made edits is asked to review/approve
    ↓
Published as operator-contributed best practice
    ↓
AI learns pattern, starts including empathy automatically
```

---

### Capture Method 4: Team Knowledge Sharing Transcription

**Process:**

```
Weekly team meeting: Operator shares complex case solution
    ↓
Recording auto-transcribed
    ↓
AI extracts key insights
    ↓
Generates draft KB article
    ↓
Presenter reviews and approves
    ↓
Published in operator_knowledge/case_studies/
    ↓
Searchable and reusable by all
```

---

## Task 23: Knowledge Graph for Connections

### Concept: Connect Related Knowledge Intelligently

**Problem:** KB articles exist in isolation, connections not obvious

**Solution:** Knowledge graph shows relationships between concepts

---

### Knowledge Graph Structure

**Nodes (Concepts):**

```
ARTICLE NODES:
├─ Policy Articles (Return Policy v2.1, Shipping Policy v2.1, etc.)
├─ Procedure Articles (Refund Process, Escalation Guide, etc.)
├─ Troubleshooting Articles (Login Issues, Payment Failures, etc.)
├─ Training Articles (5-Question Framework, Escalation Matrix, etc.)
└─ Operator Wisdom (Tips, Case Studies, Best Practices)

CONCEPT NODES:
├─ "Returns" (concept)
├─ "Escalation" (concept)
├─ "Customer Anger" (concept)
└─ [...]
```

**Edges (Relationships):**

```
RELATIONSHIP TYPES:

"Prerequisite" - Must know A before B
Example: "5-Question Framework" → prerequisite → "Advanced Decision-Making"

"Related" - Often used together
Example: "Return Policy" ← related → "Exchange Process"

"Supersedes" - Replaces old version
Example: "Return Policy v2.1" → supersedes → "Return Policy v2.0"

"Example Of" - Concrete instance of concept
Example: "Angry Customer Scenario #3" → example of → "Customer Anger"

"Solves" - Solution to problem
Example: "Escalation Guide" → solves → "Policy Exception Requests"

"References" - Cites or uses
Example: "Refund Process" → references → "Refund Policy v2.1"
```

---

### Knowledge Graph Visualization

```
                    [Return Policy v2.1]
                           |
                    ┌──────┴──────┐
                    |             |
              prerequisite    related
                    |             |
                    ↓             ↓
           [Refund Process]  [Exchange Process]
                    |             |
                 solves        solves
                    |             |
                    ↓             ↓
          [Refund Requests]  [Size Changes]
                    ↑             ↑
                    |             |
              example of    example of
                    |             |
           [Case Study #5]  [Case Study #12]
```

**Operator Benefit:**
"Reading Return Policy v2.1? You might also need Refund Process and Exchange Process (automatically suggested)"

---

### Graph-Powered Features

**Feature 1: Smart Suggestions**

```
Operator searches: "customer wants refund"
    ↓
Graph returns:
1. Refund Policy v2.1 (primary match)
2. Return Process (prerequisite - often needed first)
3. Escalation Guide (refunds >$100)
4. Case Study: Angry Refund Request (example)
5. Best Practice: Empathetic Refund Language (related)

Result: Comprehensive answer, not just one article
```

**Feature 2: Learning Path Generation**

```
Want to learn: "Expert Escalation"
    ↓
Graph traces prerequisite chain:
1. Start: 5-Question Framework (foundation)
2. Then: Escalation Matrix (know who handles what)
3. Then: Policy Knowledge (know what requires approval)
4. Then: Expert Escalation Techniques (advanced)

Result: Optimal learning sequence auto-generated
```

**Feature 3: Gap Identification**

```
Graph analysis shows:
"Refund Policy" has 15 outgoing connections
"Warranty Policy" has 2 outgoing connections

Insight: Warranty Policy under-documented
Action: Create more warranty-related procedures and examples
```

---

## Task 24: Knowledge Search & Discovery

### Advanced Search System

**Beyond Basic Keyword Search:**

---

### Search Method 1: Semantic Search (Primary)

**Powered by:** LlamaIndex + OpenAI Embeddings

**How It Works:**

```
Operator searches: "customer mad about late delivery"
    ↓
NOT keyword matching ("mad" "late" "delivery")
    ↓
INSTEAD semantic understanding:
"Operator needs information about handling frustrated customers
regarding shipping delays"
    ↓
Returns:
1. Shipping Delay Response Template (94% relevance)
2. Handling Frustrated Customers Guide (91% relevance)
3. Late Delivery Escalation Thresholds (87% relevance)
4. Empathy Techniques for Service Failures (85% relevance)

Result: Finds what operator MEANS, not just what they TYPE
```

---

### Search Method 2: Contextual Search

**Uses Current Work Context:**

```
Operator currently reviewing approval for:
- Conversation ID: #501
- Customer: Frustrated about shipping
- Issue: Order 5 days late
    ↓
KB search automatically includes context:
- Customer history (new vs loyal)
- Order value (impacts decision authority)
- Previous escalations from this customer
    ↓
Returns context-specific results:
"For loyal customer + moderate delay → Consider shipping credit"
vs
"For new customer + extreme delay → Standard apology + tracking"

Result: Answers tailored to specific situation
```

---

### Search Method 3: Conversational Search

**Ask Questions in Natural Language:**

```
Search: "Can I approve a return if it's been 35 days?"
    ↓
AI understands:
- This is a policy question (returns)
- Asking about authority (can I approve)
- Specific timeframe (35 days vs 30-day policy)
    ↓
Returns structured answer:
"No - returns >30 days require manager approval (per Escalation Matrix).
However, you can escalate with recommendation based on:
- Customer value (check order history)
- Reason for delay (travel, hospitalization valid)
- Item condition (unused increases approval likelihood)

See: Return Policy v2.1, Escalation Guide, Policy Exception Examples"

Result: Direct answer + supporting articles
```

---

### Discovery Features

**Feature 1: "Operators Who Found This Helpful Also Viewed..."**

```
You're reading: "5-Question Framework"

Operators who found this helpful also viewed:
├─ Quick Start Guide (92% correlation)
├─ Common Editing Patterns (87% correlation)
└─ Escalation Decision Tree (81% correlation)

Result: Discover related content automatically
```

**Feature 2: "Related to Your Current Work"**

```
Based on your recent approvals, you might find helpful:
├─ Handling Shipping Delays (you reviewed 8 shipping cases this week)
├─ International Customer Communication (3 international cases)
└─ High-Value Customer Protocols (2 cases >$500)

Result: Just-in-time learning suggestions
```

**Feature 3: "Trending This Week"**

```
🔥 What operators are searching for:
1. "Return policy after 40 days" (23 searches) - Holiday returns season
2. "Error 500 checkout" (18 searches) - System issue identified
3. "Angry customer de-escalation" (15 searches) - High-stress week

Action: Create quick guides for trending topics
```

```
All KB articles in git repository

Commit on every change:
- Commit message: "feat: Extend return policy to 30 days (v2.1.0)"
- Tagged release: v2.1.0
- Branch protection: PR required for policies
- Change log auto-generated from commits

History available:
- View any previous version
- Compare versions (diff view)
- Rollback if needed
```

**Supabase Tracking:**

```sql
-- Version History Table
CREATE TABLE kb_versions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    article_id UUID REFERENCES kb_articles(id),
    version TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Full content at this version
    changes TEXT,           -- Description of changes
    impact_level TEXT,      -- High, Medium, Low
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_by TEXT,
    deprecated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    superseded_by TEXT      -- Next version number
);
```

---

### Version Notification System

**When Policy Changes:**

```
1. New version published (Return Policy v2.1.0)
    ↓
2. System identifies affected stakeholders:
   - All operators (policy change)
   - AI system (needs retraining)
   - Managers (approval thresholds may change)
    ↓
3. Auto-generates notification:

EMAIL: "IMPORTANT: Return Policy Updated to v2.1.0"

What Changed:
• Return window: 14 days → 30 days (MAJOR CHANGE)
• International returns: New procedures added

Impact:
• ALL return decisions affected
• More returns will be within policy (fewer escalations)
• Update your Quick Start Guide reference

Effective: Immediately
Old Version (v2.0.0): Deprecated as of today

Action Required:
□ Read new policy: [link]
□ Update any saved notes
□ Apply new policy to all decisions starting now
□ Reply "CONFIRMED" when read

    ↓
4. Track confirmation (ensure 100% operator acknowledgment)
    ↓
5. AI retrained on new version
    ↓
6. Old version marked deprecated (but kept for history)
```

## Task 28: Knowledge Retention Strategies

### Strategies to Keep Knowledge in Operators' Minds

**Problem:** Operators can access KB, but internalization is better for speed and quality

---

### Strategy 1: Core Knowledge Internalization

**Essential Knowledge to Memorize:**

```
TIER 1: Must Know by Heart (No lookup needed)
├─ Return policy: 30 days from delivery
├─ Escalation thresholds: >$100, threats, technical, unsure
├─ SLA times: Urgent 15min, High 2hrs, Standard 4hrs
├─ 5-Question Framework: Accuracy, Completeness, Tone, Clarity, Risk
└─ Red flags: Legal, social media, BBB, FTC, high-value

Retention Method: Spaced repetition (daily Week 1, weekly Month 1, monthly ongoing)

TIER 2: Know Well (Quick recall, minimal lookup)
├─ Common scenarios and resolutions
├─ Troubleshooting decision trees
├─ Template selection criteria
└─ Confidence score interpretation

Retention Method: Weekly refreshers, monthly scenarios

TIER 3: Know Where to Find (Lookup okay)
├─ Specific policy details
├─ Rare edge cases
├─ Technical procedures
└─ Historical changes

Retention Method: Familiarity with KB structure, quick search skills
```

---

### Strategy 2: Chunking & Mnemonics

**Make Knowledge Memorable:**

**5-Question Framework Mnemonic:**
**A.C.T.C.R.**

- **A**ccuracy
- **C**ompleteness
- **T**one
- **C**larity
- **R**isk

"**ACT** with **CR**itical thinking"

**Escalation SLA Mnemonic:**
**"U-H-S = 15-2-4"**

- **U**rgent = **15** minutes
- **H**igh = **2** hours
- **S**tandard = **4** hours

**Red Flags Mnemonic:**
**"L.E.T. T.H.E.M. go to manager"**

- **L**egal threats
- **E**xecutive complaints (C-suite)
- **T**hreatening behavior
- **T**echnical emergencies
- **H**igh-value (>$100)
- **E**xtreme anger
- **M**edia threats (social, press)

---

### Strategy 3: Deliberate Practice Schedules

**Spaced Practice Sessions:**

```
DAILY MICRO-PRACTICE (5 min):
- One scenario from memory
- Apply framework without looking
- Check answer
- Reinforce correct patterns

WEEKLY CHALLENGE (15 min):
- 10 rapid-fire decisions
- Timed for speed
- Accuracy tracked
- Identify knowledge gaps

MONTHLY DEEP PRACTICE (30 min):
- 5 complex scenarios
- Full analysis required
- Peer review
- Discussion of approaches

Result: Constant reinforcement prevents knowledge decay
```

---

### Strategy 4: Real-World Application Tracking

**Learn → Apply → Reflect Loop:**

```
Monday: Learn new technique (e.g., "Strategic escalation analysis")
    ↓
Tuesday-Thursday: Apply in real approvals
    ↓
Friday: Reflect and document

Questions:
- How many times did I use this technique?
- What worked well?
- What was challenging?
- What will I do differently next week?

Result: Theory → Practice → Mastery
```

---

### Strategy 5: Knowledge Sharing Reinforcement

**Teaching = Best Retention:**

```
Month 1: Learn "Advanced editing techniques"
Month 2: Practice and refine
Month 3: Teach to team in knowledge sharing session
    ↓
Result: Deepest possible retention

Research shows:
- Passive reading: 10% retention
- Practice by doing: 75% retention
- Teaching others: 90% retention

Strategy: Create opportunities to teach
```

- Edit pattern recognition (best practices → KB)
- Team knowledge sharing transcription (meetings → articles)
- Operator expertise automatically captured

✅ **Task 23: Knowledge Graph for Connections**

- Graph structure (nodes = articles/concepts, edges = relationships)
- 6 relationship types (prerequisite, related, supersedes, example, solves, references)
- Smart suggestions (comprehensive answers, not isolated articles)
- Learning path generation (optimal sequence)
- Gap identification (under-connected topics need work)

✅ **Task 24: Knowledge Search & Discovery**

- Semantic search (meaning, not keywords - LlamaIndex powered)
- Contextual search (uses current work context)
- Conversational search (natural language questions)
- Discovery features (recommendations, trending topics)
- Just-in-time suggestions based on recent work

✅ **Task 25: Knowledge Quality Assurance**

- 5 quality dimensions (accuracy, currency, completeness, clarity, helpfulness)
- Quality assurance process (creation → publication → monitoring → maintenance)
- Auto-flagging for outdated content
- Operator feedback integration
- Continuous improvement cycle

✅ **Task 26: Knowledge Versioning**

- Version scheme (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Version history tracking (all changes documented)
- Git integration (version control, rollback capability)
- Supabase version history table
- Notification system for changes (operator awareness 100%)

✅ **Task 27: Knowledge Analytics**

- Article-level analytics (views, helpful ratings, usage in approvals)
- Category-level analytics (coverage, gaps)
- Search analytics (what operators need, what's missing)
- AI performance correlation (KB quality → draft quality)
- Data-driven KB improvement prioritization

✅ **Task 28: Knowledge Retention Strategies**

- Core knowledge internalization (3 tiers: must know, know well, know where to find)
- Chunking & mnemonics (memorable frameworks)
- Deliberate practice schedules (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Real-world application tracking (learn → apply → reflect)
- Teaching reinforcement (teaching others = 90% retention)
