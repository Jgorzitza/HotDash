**Purpose:** Understanding OCC tiles and optimizing AI partnership  
**Covers:** Tasks 2M (Dashboard Analytics) + 2N (AI Collaboration)  
**Level:** All operators  
**Created:** 2025-10-12

## PART 1: Dashboard Analytics Training (Task 2M)

### Understanding OCC Tiles

**Purpose:** Operators need to understand the context tiles provide when reviewing approvals

---

### Tile 1: Sales Pulse

**What It Shows:**

- Revenue trends (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Top-selling products
- Revenue alerts (unusual spikes/drops)
- Order volume

**How It Helps Approvals:**

```
Scenario: Customer asks about product availability

Sales Pulse shows: Super Serum sold 50 units yesterday (high demand)

Context for AI: Product is popular, may be low stock

What to check: Is stock available before AI promises quick shipping?

Action: If AI says "ships today" but Sales Pulse shows high demand, verify
inventory before approving
```

**Reading the Tile:**

- Green trend = revenue up (good)
- Red trend = revenue down (investigate if sustained)
- Alerts = unusual activity (check context)

---

### Tile 2: Ops Pulse

**What It Shows:**

- Unresolved customer inquiries
- Response time performance
- SLA compliance
- Escalation queue status

**How It Helps Approvals:**

```
Scenario: Customer complaining about slow response

Ops Pulse shows: Response time currently 6 hours (high)

Context: We're behind today

AI might say: "Sorry for the delay..."

Check: Is the apology in AI's response adequate for a 6-hour wait? Might
need stronger apology or compensation offer

Action: If customer waited 6+ hours and AI just says "sorry", consider
rejecting and adding compensation (discount code, priority handling)
```

---

### Tile 3: Inventory Pulse

**What It Shows:**

- Stock levels for all products
- Low stock alerts
- Out of stock items
- Restocking timelines

**How It Helps Approvals:**

```
Scenario: Customer orders Night Cream

Inventory Pulse shows: Night Cream - 5 units left (low stock)

AI says: "Order ships today!"

Check: With only 5 units left, will this actually ship today or is there a
delay?

Action: Verify with fulfillment if unsure. Better to set accurate expectations
than promise and disappoint
```

---

### Using Tiles for Better Approvals

**Best Practice: The "Context Check"**

```
Before approving any AI draft:

1. Glance at relevant tiles (takes 5 seconds)
   - Sales Pulse: Product demand/availability context
   - Ops Pulse: Customer wait time context
   - Inventory Pulse: Stock availability context

2. Ask: Does AI's response align with current reality?
   - Promising fast shipping but inventory is low?
   - Minimal apology but customer waited 8 hours?
   - Product recommendation but it's out of stock?

3. Adjust if needed:
   - Reject and add context about current situation
   - OR escalate if significant discrepancy

Result: More accurate, contextual responses to customers
```

## PART 2: AI Collaboration Training (Task 2N)

### Working With AI Suggestions

**Mindset:** AI is your research assistant, you're the decision maker

---

### Section 1: When to Trust AI

**High Trust Situations (Usually Approve):**

```
‚úì Confidence >90%
‚úì Simple factual questions (order status, policy basics)
‚úì AI cites current KB sources (v2.1 policies)
‚úì Information matches what you see in system
‚úì Routine inquiries
‚úì No red flags present

Example:
Customer: "What's your return policy?"
AI (95% confidence): "We offer 30-day returns from delivery date..."
KB Source: Return Policy v2.1 (current)

Decision: Trust and approve (30 seconds)
```

---

### Section 2: When to Verify Carefully

**Medium Trust Situations (Verify Before Approving):**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Confidence 70-89%
‚ö†Ô∏è Complex multi-part questions
‚ö†Ô∏è Policy edge cases (customer at 29 days, etc.)
‚ö†Ô∏è Technical product questions
‚ö†Ô∏è Compensation or refund offers

Example:
Customer: "Can I exchange Night Cream for Day Moisturizer after 25 days?"
AI (78% confidence): "Yes, our exchange policy allows this within 30 days..."
KB Source: Exchange Policy v1.0

Decision: Verify exchange policy details, check if price difference matters,
then approve if accurate (2-3 minutes)
```

---

### Section 3: When to Override AI

**Low Trust Situations (Reject or Escalate):**

```
üî¥ Confidence <70%
üî¥ AI cites outdated KB sources (v2.0 instead of v2.1)
üî¥ Information contradicts what you see in system
üî¥ AI missed obvious red flags
üî¥ Response doesn't actually answer question
üî¥ Tone is off (too formal, not empathetic, etc.)

Example:
Customer: "I'm so frustrated! Order wrong again!"
AI (65% confidence): "We apologize. Here's your tracking number..."
Issue: AI didn't address "wrong again" (repeat issue)

Decision: Reject - AI missed that this is a pattern. Manual response needed
to acknowledge repeated issue and provide better solution (maybe free shipping
on next order)
```

---

### Section 4: Teaching AI Through Your Decisions

**Every Decision is a Teaching Moment:**

**Approvals Teach:** "This approach works"

```
You approve AI draft using specific empathy language
    ‚Üì
AI learns: "This language style works for upset customers"
    ‚Üì
AI uses similar empathy in future drafts
    ‚Üì
Your approval rate increases
```

**Edits Teach:** "Use this style" (if editing feature exists)

```
You edit AI draft to add: "I'm personally making sure this ships today"
    ‚Üì
AI learns: "Personal accountability statements work well"
    ‚Üì
AI starts including similar phrases
    ‚Üì
Customer responses improve
```

**Rejections Teach:** "Don't do this"

```
You reject with note: "AI cited Return Policy v2.0 but current is v2.1 (30 days not 14)"
    ‚Üì
AI learns: "Always use v2.1, not v2.0"
    ‚Üì
Engineering updates KB indexing priority
    ‚Üì
Future drafts cite correct version
```

**Escalations Teach:** "I can't handle this"

```
You escalate: "Customer injury mentioned - above my authority"
    ‚Üì
AI learns: "Injury = always flag for escalation"
    ‚Üì
Future injury mentions get auto-flagged
    ‚Üì
Safer handling of sensitive situations
```

---

### Section 5: Providing Effective Feedback to AI

**Quality Rejection Notes:**

**Bad Rejection Note:**

> "Wrong"

**AI learns:** Nothing (no context)

**Good Rejection Note:**

> "AI cited Return Policy v2.0 (14 days) but current policy is v2.1 (30 days). Customer at 20 days should be eligible for return."

**AI learns:** Specific error (version), correct version (v2.1), impact (customer eligibility)

**Great Rejection Note:**

> "AI cited outdated Return Policy v2.0 (14-day window). Current policy is v2.1 (30-day window) effective Oct 1, 2025. Customer purchased Oct 1, returning Oct 20 = 20 days = WITHIN policy. AI incorrectly denied. Also, AI tone was abrupt - could have been more apologetic for confusion. Recommend: Update KB indexing to prioritize v2.1, add empathy training for policy corrections."

**AI learns:** Everything + suggestions for improvement

---

### Section 6: AI Confidence Calibration

**Understanding What Confidence Really Means:**

**High Confidence Doesn't Always Mean Correct:**

```
Scenario: AI is 98% confident but wrong

Why? AI might be:
- Very confident in outdated information
- Confident but using wrong KB source
- Confident in interpretation that's technically incorrect

Your job: Trust but verify, always
```

**Low Confidence Doesn't Always Mean Wrong:**

```
Scenario: AI is 68% confident but actually correct

Why? AI might be:
- Uncertain because customer question was ambiguous
- Found conflicting information in KB (needs cleanup)
- Dealing with edge case (unusual scenario)

Your job: Review carefully, might be fine to approve
```

**The Calibration Loop:**

```
Week 1: AI confidence is rough estimate
    ‚Üì
You approve/reject based on accuracy (not confidence)
    ‚Üì
Week 4: AI learns which situations warrant high vs low confidence
    ‚Üì
Week 8: Confidence scores become more reliable
    ‚Üì
Month 6: Confidence is highly calibrated predictor

Your decisions calibrate the AI over time!
```

### Section 7: Advanced AI Collaboration

**The Expert Operator's AI Partnership:**

**1. Pattern Recognition Collaboration**

```
You notice: AI consistently struggles with [specific scenario]

Action: Document the pattern, share with team

Example: "AI always suggests immediate cancellation for subscription
cancellation requests. Should try retention first per guidelines.
Suggesting AI training update."

Result: AI gets better at retention for everyone
```

**2. KB Gap Identification**

```
You reject 3 times for similar issue: "No KB source for wholesale inquiries"

Action: Flag KB gap to knowledge team

Example: "Seeing increase in wholesale questions but no KB article.
Recommendation: Create 'Wholesale Inquiry Response Template' article."

Result: AI gets better resources, fewer rejections
```

**3. Quality Improvement Suggestions**

```
You notice: AI often forgets to include order confirmation link

Action: Suggest feature improvement

Example: "For all order confirmations, AI should auto-include link to order
status page. Currently only includes sometimes. Suggest making this automatic."

Result: Consistent quality improvement
```

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Trust or Verify?

**Customer:** "Is Super Serum safe for rosacea?"  
**AI (72%):** "Super Serum is formulated for sensitive skin and doesn't contain common irritants. However, we recommend patch testing first if you have rosacea."  
**KB Source:** Product Safety Guidelines v1.0

**Your decision:** Trust and approve? OR verify/escalate?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Verify then approve.** Medical condition mentioned (rosacea), so verify AI's advice is appropriate. AI's response is good - acknowledges sensitivity, recommends patch test (safe advice), doesn't claim to cure medical condition. This is appropriately cautious. Approve.

</details>

---

### Scenario 2: Teaching Moment

**Customer:** "Your website says free shipping but I was charged $8!"  
**AI (85%):** "You're right, that's an error. I've refunded the $8 shipping charge. It should appear in 3-5 business days."  
**KB Source:** Shipping Policy v2.1

**AI handled well. What does your approval teach AI?**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Approval teaches:** "When customer is right about an error, acknowledge immediately, fix it, provide timeline." This reinforces good customer service patterns for error situations.
