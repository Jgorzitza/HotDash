## Part 1: Quantitative Analysis

### Metrics Performance vs Targets

**Run Final Metrics Report**:

```bash
# Generate comprehensive 2-week report
npm run pilot:metrics:final-report --start=2025-10-28 --end=2025-11-08

# Expected output includes:
# - Total drafts reviewed
# - Approval rate trends
# - System uptime
# - Operator satisfaction scores
# - Bug counts and resolution times
```

**Metrics Table**:

| Metric | Target | Week 1 Actual | Week 2 Actual | 2-Week Avg | Status |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| **Operator Satisfaction** | >6.5/10 | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |
| **Approval Rate** | >35% | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |
| **Avg Review Time** | <2 min | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |
| **System Uptime** | >95% | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |
| **KB Coverage** | >85% | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |

**Threshold for Success**:
- **Pass**: 4/5 metrics meet or exceed targets
- **Conditional Pass**: 3/5 metrics meet targets, clear plan to fix others
- **Fail**: <3/5 metrics meet targets

---

### Time Savings Analysis

**Calculate Actual Time Saved**:

**Before Agent SDK (Manual)**:
- Avg time per inquiry: 4.5 min
- Daily volume per operator: 50 inquiries
- Daily time: 225 min (3.75 hours)

**With Agent SDK (Pilot)**:
- Avg time per inquiry: [TBD from data]
- Daily volume per operator: [TBD from data]
- Daily time: [TBD]

**Time Saved**:
- Per inquiry: [TBD] min saved
- Per operator per day: [TBD] min saved
- Per operator per week: [TBD] hours saved
- **Total for 5 operators (2 weeks)**: [TBD] hours saved

**ROI Calculation**:
- Operator hourly rate: $25/hr (avg)
- Hours saved (2 weeks): [TBD]
- **Labor cost savings (2 weeks)**: $[TBD]
- Development investment: ~$40K (estimated)
- **Break-even timeline**: [TBD months]

### Bug Analysis

**Bug Count by Priority**:

| Priority | Reported | Fixed During Pilot | Still Open | Fix Rate |
|----------|----------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| P0 (Critical) | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD]% |
| P1 (High) | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD]% |
| P2 (Medium) | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD]% |
| P3 (Low) | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD]% |

**Red Flags**:
- Any P0 bugs still open ‚Üí Must fix before rollout
- P1 bug fix rate <80% ‚Üí Need more QA testing
- Total bug count >50 ‚Üí System not stable enough

**Green Flags**:
- Zero P0 bugs by end of pilot
- P1 bug fix rate >90%
- Most bugs are P3 (polish issues)

---

## Part 2: Qualitative Analysis

### Operator Feedback Synthesis

**Themes Analysis**:

**Step 1**: Compile all feedback from:
- Daily quick surveys (10 days x 5 operators = 50 responses)
- Weekly deep-dive surveys (2 weeks x 5 operators = 10 responses)
- Office hours notes
- Slack conversations
- Debrief meeting (Nov 11)

**Step 2**: Categorize feedback into themes:

```markdown
## Feedback Themes - Pilot

### üéâ What Operators Loved (Strengths)
1. **Time Savings**: [X] operators mentioned saving 1-2 hours/day
   - Quote: "I can finally take real lunch breaks!"
2. **Draft Quality**: [X] operators said drafts were "surprisingly good"
   - Quote: "80% of the time, I approve with zero edits"
3. **Empowerment**: [X] operators liked being in control
   - Quote: "I approve what I trust, reject what I don't"

### üòï What Frustrated Operators (Weaknesses)
1. **KB Gaps**: [X] operators complained about missing information
   - Quote: "It keeps suggesting outdated policies"
2. **UX Friction**: [X] operators found bulk approve hard to discover
   - Quote: "Took me 3 days to find that button"
3. **Escalation Confusion**: [X] operators unsure when to escalate
   - Quote: "I didn't know if I was allowed to escalate this"

### üí° Feature Requests (Opportunities)
1. **Custom Templates**: [X] operators want to save their edits
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: [X] operators want faster navigation
3. **Better Confidence Scores**: [X] operators want clearer indicators

### üêõ Bugs Reported (Threats)
1. **Order Number Mismatch**: Reported [X] times
2. **Slow Dashboard Load**: Reported [X] times
3. **Missing Notifications**: Reported [X] times
```

**Frequency Count**: How many operators mentioned each theme?
- If 4+/5 operators mention it ‚Üí Critical (must address)
- If 2-3/5 operators mention it ‚Üí Important (should address)
- If 1/5 operators mention it ‚Üí Edge case (nice to have)

---

### Operator Confidence Analysis

**Survey Question**: "How confident are you in Agent SDK's drafts?" (1-10)

**Results**:
| Operator | Week 1 Confidence | Week 2 Confidence | Trend |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Sarah | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí |
| Marcus | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí |
| David | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí |
| Emily | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí |
| Aisha | [TBD] | [TBD] | ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí |
| **Avg** | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |

**Interpretation**:
- ‚Üë (increasing confidence) ‚Üí Operators learning to trust system
- ‚Üí (flat confidence) ‚Üí System stable, no surprises
- ‚Üì (decreasing confidence) ‚Üí Quality degrading or trust eroding

**Red Flag**: If confidence trending down ‚Üí Investigate why

## Part 3: Go/No-Go Decision Framework

### Decision Criteria

**GO (Full Rollout)**:

Must meet ALL of these:
- ‚úÖ 4/5 quantitative metrics hit targets
- ‚úÖ Operator satisfaction >6.5/10 (avg)
- ‚úÖ Zero P0 bugs remaining
- ‚úÖ P1 bug fix rate >80%
- ‚úÖ 4+/5 operators vote "yes" to full rollout
- ‚úÖ KB coverage >85%

**CONDITIONAL GO (Fix Then Rollout)**:

Must meet MOST of these:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3/5 quantitative metrics hit targets (with plan to fix)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Operator satisfaction 6.0-6.5/10 (trending up)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Zero P0 bugs, few P1 bugs (clear fix timeline)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3/5 operators vote "yes" (others neutral, not no)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è KB coverage 80-85% (improving)

**Action**: Fix issues identified, retest with pilots for 3-5 days, then rollout

**NO-GO (Pause, Reassess)**:

If ANY of these are true:
- ‚ùå <3/5 quantitative metrics hit targets
- ‚ùå Operator satisfaction <6.0/10
- ‚ùå Any P0 bugs still open
- ‚ùå 3+/5 operators vote "no" to rollout
- ‚ùå Major trust issues (e.g., "AI suggestions are dangerous")

**Action**: Pause rollout, conduct deep retrospective, major fixes needed

---

### Risk Assessment

**Risks to Full Rollout**:

1. **Quality Risk**: What if AI quality degrades at scale?
   - Mitigation: Monitor approval rates closely Week 1, scale slowly
   
2. **Operator Adoption Risk**: What if full team rejects it?
   - Mitigation: Intensive training, optional first 2 weeks
   
3. **System Performance Risk**: What if system can't handle 50 operators?
   - Mitigation: Load testing pre-rollout, phased scaling (10 ‚Üí 25 ‚Üí 50)
   
4. **Customer Experience Risk**: What if wrong info goes to customers?
   - Mitigation: Keep approval gates, audit random 5% of interactions

---

## Part 4: Rollout Plan (If GO)

### Phased Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1: Expand to 15 Operators** (Nov 18-22, Week 1)
- Add 10 more operators (total: 15)
- Select high performers + volunteers
- Same training as pilot
- Monitor closely (same metrics)

**Phase 2: Expand to 35 Operators** (Nov 25-29, Week 2)
- Add 20 more operators (total: 35)
- Group training sessions
- Monitor for scalability issues

**Phase 3: Full Rollout** (Dec 2+)
- All 50 operators
- Mandatory training for remaining operators
- Optional first week (operators can opt out temporarily)

**Criteria to Advance Between Phases**:
- Metrics stable at targets
- No new P0/P1 bugs
- Operator satisfaction maintained

---

### Fixes Before Rollout

**Must-Fix (Blockers)**:
- [ ] All P0 bugs closed
- [ ] Top 3 operator frustrations addressed
- [ ] KB coverage >85%
- [ ] Training materials updated based on pilot feedback

**Should-Fix (Important)**:
- [ ] All P1 bugs closed
- [ ] UX improvements (bulk approve visibility, etc.)
- [ ] Escalation workflow clarified

**Nice-to-Fix (Phase 2)**:
- [ ] Custom templates
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Dashboard polish
