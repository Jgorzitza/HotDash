## ✅ Alignment Confirmation

### Foundation Documents Reviewed

**Reviewed on 2025-10-12**:

- ✅ `docs/NORTH_STAR.md` - Operator-first control center, evidence-driven, MCP-first
- ✅ `docs/directions/README.md` - Single-owner workflow, evidence gate, self-testing mandate
- ✅ `README.md` - Project structure, MCP tools, canonical toolkit
- ✅ `docs/directions/product.md` - Tasks 1-115 assigned, continue work directive

**Key Principles Applied**:

1. **Operator-First**: Operators are our internal customers - all documents serve them
2. **Evidence Requirement**: Every deliverable has file path, timestamp, content proof
3. **MCP-First Development**: Verify with MCP tools, don't trust training data
4. **Practical Over Theoretical**: Immediately useful documents, not abstract strategy
