## PLG Principles

### 1. Free to Start (Open Source)

- Self-serve onboarding
- Value in minutes, not days
- No sales call required

### 2: In-Product Upsells

- "You're at 4,800/5,000 tickets. Upgrade to avoid overage"
- "Unlock Billing Agent for $300/month"
- "Want priority support? Upgrade to Enterprise"

### 3: Viral Loops

- "Invite another operator" (team growth)
- "Share this draft" (show colleagues how good AI is)
- "Refer a friend" (10% commission)

### 4: Usage-Driven Expansion

- Customers naturally hit limits as they grow
- Upgrade path is obvious and valuable
- No sales pressure needed
