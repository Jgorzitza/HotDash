## Phase 2 Features (Month 1-2: Nov-Dec 2025)

### Priority 1: Approval Queue UX Enhancements

**Based on Anticipated Pilot Feedback**:

#### Feature 2.1: Bulk Actions

**Problem**: Operators reviewing 10-15 drafts per hour need faster actions
**Solution**:

- Select multiple high-confidence drafts (>90%) and approve all at once
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+A` (approve), `Ctrl+E` (edit), `Ctrl+X` (escalate)
- Bulk confidence filter: "Show me all >95% confidence drafts"

**Success Metric**: Drafts reviewed per hour increases from 15 â†’ 20
**Timeline**: Week 1 post-pilot (Nov 11-15)

#### Feature 2.2: Inline Editing

**Problem**: Switching between review and edit modes is slow
**Solution**:

- Edit draft text directly in approval card (no modal/separate page)
- Track changes highlighted (what AI wrote vs what operator changed)
- Learning loop captures inline edits for training

**Success Metric**: Edit time reduced from 2 min â†’ 1 min avg
**Timeline**: Week 2 post-pilot (Nov 18-22)

#### Feature 2.3: Quick Response Templates

**Problem**: Common edits (adding empathy, adjusting tone) are repetitive
**Solution**:

- Preset templates: "Add apology", "Add empathy", "Make more concise"
- One-click template application
- Custom templates per operator

**Success Metric**: >50% of operators use templates weekly
**Timeline**: Week 3 post-pilot (Nov 25-29)

#### Feature 2.4: Priority Sorting

**Problem**: High-urgency inquiries buried in queue
**Solution**:

- Auto-sort by: Urgency (angry customers first), Wait time, Confidence score
- Operator can override sort order
- Visual urgency indicators (ðŸ”´ high, ðŸŸ¡ medium, ðŸŸ¢ low)

**Success Metric**: Average wait time for urgent inquiries <5 min
**Timeline**: Week 4 post-pilot (Dec 2-6)

---

### Priority 2: Agent Capability Expansions

#### Feature 2.5: Sentiment-Aware Responses

**Problem**: Frustrated customers need more empathetic tone
**Solution**:

- Detect customer sentiment (angry, frustrated, neutral, happy)
- Adjust draft tone accordingly
- Flag angry customers for human review before sending

**Sentiment Detection**:

```
Angry keywords: "unacceptable", "demand", "lawyer", "BBB"
Frustrated keywords: "still waiting", "again", "why haven't"
Happy keywords: "thank you", "great", "love"
```

**Success Metric**: Reduced escalations for sentiment-related issues by 30%
**Timeline**: Month 2 (Dec 9-20)

#### Feature 2.6: Multi-Issue Handling

**Problem**: Customers ask multiple questions in one message
**Solution**:

- Detect multiple distinct questions
- Generate structured response addressing each point
- Number responses: "1. Your order shipped on...", "2. Your refund will..."

**Example**:

```
Customer: "Where is my order #12345? Also, can I change my shipping address?"
Agent detects: 2 issues (order status + address change)
Response: Addresses both with clear numbering
```

**Success Metric**: Multi-issue inquiries resolved in one interaction >80%
**Timeline**: Month 2 (Dec 9-20)

#### Feature 2.7: Personalization Engine

**Problem**: Generic responses lack personal touch
**Solution**:

- Reference customer's order history: "I see you're a loyal customer since 2023"
- Mention past positive interactions: "Glad we resolved your last issue quickly"
- Use customer's preferred name (if known)
- Detect return customers and adjust tone

**Success Metric**: CSAT for repeat customers +0.3 points
**Timeline**: Month 2 (Dec 16-31)

---

## Phase 3 Features (Month 3-4: Jan-Feb 2026)

### Priority 3: Learning Loop Enhancements

#### Feature 3.1: Pattern Recognition

**Problem**: Same knowledge base gaps appear repeatedly
**Solution**:

- Daily report: "Top 10 queries with no good KB results"
- Auto-create KB article stubs from common rejections
- Suggest new FAQ topics based on inquiry volume

**Example**:

```
Pattern detected: 15 inquiries about "holiday shipping cutoff"
Action: Auto-create KB article stub, notify Support Agent
Result: Future inquiries answered instantly
```

**Success Metric**: KB coverage improves from 85% â†’ 95%
**Timeline**: Month 3 (Jan 6-17)

#### Feature 3.2: Operator-Specific Learning

**Problem**: Different operators have different tone preferences
**Solution**:

- Track operator edit patterns per individual
- Adjust tone for specific operators (e.g., Sarah prefers more emojis)
- Show operator their "approval rate by inquiry type" dashboard

**Success Metric**: Approval rate variation between operators <10%
**Timeline**: Month 3 (Jan 20-31)

#### Feature 3.3: A/B Testing for Prompts

**Problem**: Don't know which response strategies work best
**Solution**:

- Test two draft approaches (e.g., concise vs detailed)
- Route 50/50 to operators for approval
- Measure approval rate, edit rate, CSAT per approach
- Auto-adopt winner after statistical significance

**Success Metric**: Approval rate improves by +5% per iteration
**Timeline**: Month 3-4 (Jan 20 - Feb 14)

---

### Priority 4: Proactive Capabilities

#### Feature 3.4: Proactive Outreach (Limited)

**Problem**: Some issues are predictable (delayed orders)
**Solution**:

- Identify customers with orders delayed >2 days
- Generate proactive "We're sorry for the delay" draft
- Operator reviews and approves before sending
- Track proactive resolution rate

**Criteria for Proactive Outreach**:

```
IF order_status = "delayed" AND days_past_expected > 2
AND customer_has_not_contacted_us
THEN generate_proactive_draft()
```

**Success Metric**: 10% of issues resolved proactively before customer contacts us
**Timeline**: Month 4 (Feb 3-14)

#### Feature 3.5: Predictive Escalation

**Problem**: Some inquiries will need escalation; identify early
**Solution**:

- ML model predicts escalation likelihood based on message content
- Flag high-risk inquiries for senior operator review
- Auto-route to manager if refund amount >$100

**Escalation Signals**:

- Legal language ("lawyer", "sue", "BBB")
- Repeated contacts (3+ in 7 days)
- High refund amounts
- Policy exception requests

**Success Metric**: 75% of escalations predicted correctly
**Timeline**: Month 4 (Feb 17-28)

## Phase 4: Selective Auto-Approval (Month 5-6: Mar-Apr 2026)

### Relaxing Approval Gates - Criteria & Approach

**Philosophy**: Auto-approve only when confidence is _extremely_ high and risk is _extremely_ low.

### Criteria for Auto-Approval

#### Tier 1: Immediate Auto-Approval (No Operator Review)

**Conditions** (ALL must be true):

1. **High Confidence**: AI confidence score â‰¥98%
2. **Low Risk**: Inquiry type is "order status" OR "tracking number request"
3. **No Escalation Signals**: Customer sentiment is neutral or positive
4. **Historical Success**: >95% approval rate for this inquiry type in past 30 days
5. **KB Match**: Knowledge base result relevance â‰¥0.95

**Inquiry Types Eligible**:

- "Where is my order?" (with valid tracking number)
- "What's my tracking number?" (order exists, already shipped)
- "When will my order arrive?" (estimated delivery date available)
- "What are your business hours?" (simple FAQ)
- "What's your return policy?" (standard policy, no exceptions)

**Safety Nets**:

- Operator review dashboard shows all auto-approved responses
- Customers can reply "This didn't help" to trigger human review
- Daily audit: Random sample of 10% auto-approved responses
- Kill switch: Disable auto-approval instantly if CSAT drops

**Success Metric**: 20% of inquiries auto-approved with CSAT â‰¥4.5/5
**Timeline**: Month 5 (Mar 1-15)

#### Tier 2: Delayed Review (Auto-Send After 5 Minutes)

**Conditions** (ALL must be true):

1. **Medium-High Confidence**: AI confidence score 90-97%
2. **Low-Medium Risk**: Inquiry types: product info, account questions
3. **No Red Flags**: No escalation signals
4. **After-Hours**: Outside normal business hours (9 PM - 7 AM)

**Flow**:

1. Draft enters approval queue
2. If no operator reviews within 5 minutes, auto-send
3. Operator notified: "Response sent automatically (off-hours)"
4. Operator can send follow-up if response was incorrect

**Success Metric**: After-hours response time <5 min (vs 8+ hours manual)
**Timeline**: Month 6 (Apr 1-15)

#### Tier 3: Never Auto-Approve (Always Require Human Review)

**Inquiry Types**:

- Refund requests (>$50)
- Return/exchange requests
- Account security issues
- Payment failures or disputes
- Angry or threatening messages
- Legal or compliance inquiries
- First-time customer inquiries
- Policy exception requests
