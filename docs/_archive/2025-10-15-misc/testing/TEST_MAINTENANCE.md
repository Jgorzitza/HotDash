# Test Maintenance and Debt Reduction Plan

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Owner**: QA Team  
**Goal**: Keep test suite healthy, fast, and valuable

---

## Overview

A healthy test suite requires ongoing maintenance. Without it, tests become slow, flaky, outdated, and eventually ignored.

**Target Metrics**:

- Test execution time: <30s (unit), <5min (E2E)
- Flakiness rate: <1%
- Skipped tests: <5% of total
- Test debt (TODO/FIXME): <10 items
- Coverage: >80%

---

## Weekly Maintenance (30 minutes)

### Monday: Test Health Check

**Run**:

```bash
npm run test:ci          # Full test suite
npm run test:unit -- --reporter=verbose   # Detailed unit test output
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list       # E2E test list
```

**Check**:

- [ ] All tests passing?
- [ ] Any new flaky tests?
- [ ] Execution time acceptable?
- [ ] Coverage maintained or increased?

**Document**: Log findings in `feedback/qa.md`

---

### Wednesday: Flaky Test Review

**Identify** flaky tests:

```bash
# Run tests 10 times
for i in {1..10}; do npm run test:e2e >> flaky-check.log 2>&1; done

# Check for failures
grep "FAIL" flaky-check.log
```

**Actions**:

- Fix flaky tests (add waits, improve selectors)
- Skip with issue reference if unfixable
- Document in `feedback/qa.md`

---

### Friday: Coverage Report

**Generate**:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- --coverage
open coverage/vitest/index.html
```

**Review**:

- Identify files with <50% coverage
- Prioritize critical business logic
- File issues for coverage gaps
- Track progress week-over-week

---

## Monthly Maintenance (4 hours)

### Week 1: Test Debt Cleanup

**Audit**:

```bash
# Count skipped tests
grep -r "\.skip\|\.todo" tests/ | wc -l

# Count TODO comments in tests
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" tests/ | wc -l
```

**Actions**:

1. Review all `.skip()` tests
   - Fix and enable, OR
   - Convert to `.todo()` with issue, OR
   - Remove if obsolete

2. Review all `.todo()` tests
   - Implement if needed, OR
   - Create issue and keep `.todo()`, OR
   - Remove if no longer relevant

3. Address TODO comments
   - Implement or file issue

**Goal**: Reduce skipped/todo tests by 20%

---

### Week 2: Performance Optimization

**Profile slow tests**:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- --reporter=verbose | grep "Duration"
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list
```

**Optimize**:

1. Mock expensive operations
2. Reduce unnecessary waits
3. Parallelize independent tests
4. Use test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' })

**Target**: Unit tests <30s, E2E tests <5min

---

### Week 3: Coverage Gap Analysis

**Find untested code**:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- --coverage
```

**Prioritize**:

1. **High Priority**: Services, business logic (target: >90%)
2. **Medium Priority**: Components, utilities (target: >80%)
3. **Low Priority**: Routes (covered by E2E), config files

**Actions**:

- Write tests for high-priority gaps
- File issues for medium-priority gaps
- Document decision to skip low-priority

---

### Week 4: Test Refactoring

**Identify**:

- Duplicate tests
- Overly complex tests
- Tests with poor names
- Tests without assertions
- Tests that don't test anything meaningful

**Refactor**:

- Extract common setup to `beforeEach`
- Use test fixtures for shared data
- Improve test names
- Split god tests into focused tests
- Remove meaningless tests

---

## Quarterly Maintenance (1-2 days)

### Quarter Start: Test Strategy Review

**Review**:

- [ ] Test coverage vs. target (>80%)
- [ ] Test execution time trends
- [ ] Flakiness rate trends
- [ ] Test debt trends
- [ ] New testing tools/frameworks

**Update**:

- Test strategy documents
- Testing standards
- Tool versions
- CI/CD configurations

---

### Quarter End: Deep Clean

**Audit**:

1. **Test relevance**: Are tests still valuable?
2. **Test correctness**: Are tests testing the right thing?
3. **Test efficiency**: Can tests be faster?
4. **Test organization**: Is structure logical?

**Actions**:

- Remove obsolete tests (dead code)
- Consolidate duplicate tests
- Reorganize test files if needed
- Update test documentation
- Archive old evidence artifacts

---

## Test Debt Reduction Strategy

### Definition of Test Debt

**Test debt includes**:

- Skipped tests (`.skip()`)
- Incomplete tests (`.todo()`)
- Flaky tests (intermittent failures)
- Slow tests (>1s for unit, >30s for E2E)
- Tests with poor coverage
- Outdated mocks
- Missing tests for known code paths

### Debt Reduction Plan

#### Phase 1: Stop Adding Debt (Immediate)

- [ ] Enforce test requirements in PR reviews
- [ ] Add quality gates to prevent skipped tests
- [ ] Require explanation for `.todo()` or `.skip()`
- [ ] Set up flakiness monitoring

#### Phase 2: Pay Down Existing Debt (1 month)

- [ ] Fix top 10 flaky tests
- [ ] Implement top 20 `.todo()` tests
- [ ] Remove obsolete `.skip()` tests
- [ ] Optimize slowest tests
- [ ] Fill critical coverage gaps

#### Phase 3: Prevent Future Debt (Ongoing)

- [ ] Test-first development for new features
- [ ] Regular test maintenance (weekly/monthly)
- [ ] Continuous refactoring
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Coverage monitoring

---

## Test Maintenance Checklist

### Before Every PR

- [ ] Run full test suite locally
- [ ] Fix any broken tests
- [ ] Add tests for new functionality
- [ ] Update tests for modified functionality
- [ ] Remove tests for deleted functionality
- [ ] Check test execution time (no significant increase)

### During Code Review

- [ ] Verify tests exist and are meaningful
- [ ] Check test names are descriptive
- [ ] Verify assertions are correct
- [ ] Check mocks are appropriate
- [ ] Verify no `.only()` or unexplained `.skip()`
- [ ] Check for test duplication

### After PR Merged

- [ ] Monitor CI for flakiness
- [ ] Watch coverage reports
- [ ] Address any issues immediately

## Automated Test Maintenance

### GitHub Actions: Test Health Monitoring

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-health.yml
name: Test Health Monitoring

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Every Monday 9am

jobs:
  test-health:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Count skipped tests
        run: |
          SKIPPED=$(grep -r "\.skip\|\.todo" tests/ | wc -l)
          echo "Skipped tests: $SKIPPED"
          if [ "$SKIPPED" -gt 20 ]; then
            echo "⚠️ WARNING: Too many skipped tests"
          fi

      - name: Check test execution time
        run: |
          DURATION=$(npm run test:unit --silent | grep "Duration" | awk '{print $2}')
          echo "Unit test duration: $DURATION"

      - name: Generate test health report
        run: |
          echo "# Test Health Report" > test-health.md
          echo "Generated: $(date)" >> test-health.md
          echo "" >> test-health.md
          echo "- Skipped tests: $SKIPPED" >> test-health.md
          echo "- Unit test duration: $DURATION" >> test-health.md
```

## Measuring Test Quality

### Mutation Testing (Planned - Task E)

Ensures tests actually catch bugs by introducing mutations and verifying tests fail.

### Test Effectiveness Metrics

**Track**:

- Bugs caught by tests (before production)
- Bugs missed by tests (found in production)
- False positives (tests fail but code is correct)
- Test execution time per test
- Flakiness rate per test file

**Formula**:

```
Test Effectiveness = Bugs Caught / (Bugs Caught + Bugs Missed)
Target: > 90%
```

---

## Test Migration Strategy

### When Frameworks Change

**Example**: Migrating from Jest to Vitest

**Process**:

1. **Phase 1**: Set up new framework alongside old (1 week)
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate tests file by file (2 weeks)
   - Start with utilities (easy)
   - Then services (medium)
   - Finally components (complex)
3. **Phase 3**: Remove old framework (1 week)
   - Verify all tests migrated
   - Remove old dependencies
   - Update documentation

**During migration**:

- Keep both passing
- Update CI to run both
- Document migration progress
- Don't add new tests to old framework

---

## Test Removal Guidelines

### When to Delete a Test

**Delete if**:

- Feature was removed
- Test duplicates existing coverage
- Test never fails (not testing anything useful)
- Test tests implementation details that changed
- Test is obsolete (outdated assumptions)

**Keep if**:

- Tests critical business logic
- Has caught bugs in the past
- Tests security/compliance requirements
- Tests edge cases
- Regression test for past bug

### Test Removal Process

1. Verify test is truly obsolete
2. Check git history (has it caught bugs?)
3. Search for related tests
4. Remove test
5. Verify coverage doesn't drop significantly
6. Document removal in PR
