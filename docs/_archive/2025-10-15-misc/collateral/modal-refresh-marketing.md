### Sales Objection Handling

**"We don't need accessibility features"**
> Accessibility isn't just about compliance - it's about reaching more customers. Studies show accessible design improves usability for everyone, not just users with disabilities. Plus, WCAG compliance reduces legal risk and demonstrates enterprise-grade quality.

**"This seems like over-engineering"**
> Modern users expect responsive, fast, accessible interfaces. This foundation ensures your platform can scale and adapt to future requirements while meeting current enterprise standards. The React Router 7 and Supabase integration also future-proofs your investment.

**"Our current modals work fine"**
> "Work fine" vs. "work exceptionally" is the difference between meeting minimum expectations and delighting users. Our testing shows measurable improvements in completion rates, user satisfaction, and reduced support tickets.

**"We're concerned about development complexity"**
> We've built comprehensive implementation guides, code examples, and testing frameworks that actually reduce development complexity. The standardized patterns make future modal development faster and more consistent.
