## What The Dashboard Does NOT Mean

❌ **NOT**: Your manager judging your performance
✅ **IS**: Tool to help YOU see your own improvement

❌ **NOT**: Pressure to hit certain numbers
✅ **IS**: Visibility into how Agent SDK is working for you

❌ **NOT**: Comparison to others (leaderboard is optional/fun)
✅ **IS**: See where you can improve or celebrate wins

---

## How to Use Your Dashboard

### Daily (30 seconds)
- Quick glance at today's metrics
- Check if you're getting faster
- See any insights or tips

### Weekly (2 minutes)
- Review 7-day trend
- See improvement over time
- Adjust if needed (e.g., "I should trust drafts more")

### Monthly (never, unless you want to)
- Dashboard is for YOU, not required viewing
- Use it if helpful, ignore it if not

## Tips for Using Dashboard Effectively

**Tip 1**: Check it once a day, not every 5 minutes
- Don't obsess over numbers
- Focus on the work, check progress at end of day

**Tip 2**: Use trends, not single-day numbers
- One bad day doesn't matter
- Look at week-over-week improvement

**Tip 3**: Share insights with team
- "I noticed my approval rate goes up when I use quick templates"
- "My review time drops in the morning vs afternoon"

**Tip 4**: Opt out of leaderboard if it stresses you
- Gamification should be fun, not pressure
- Focus on your own improvement
