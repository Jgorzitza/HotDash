## FAQs (Operators Asked in Beta Testing)

**Q: Will this replace my job?**
**A**: Absolutely not. You're still in control of every response. The AI just does the searching and drafting—you provide the judgment and empathy. Think of it like spell-check or autocomplete, not a replacement.

**Q: What if I don't trust the AI?**
**A**: That's okay! You can reject any draft and write manually. Over time, as you see the AI improve from your edits, trust builds naturally. Start cautious, get comfortable at your own pace.

**Q: Will my manager judge me on approval rate?**
**A**: No. We're tracking approval rate to measure AI quality, not your performance. If you have low approval rate, it means the AI needs improvement, not that you're doing something wrong.

**Q: What happens to my edits?**
**A**: The system learns from them! Your edits teach the AI how to write better drafts. You're literally training the AI to match your style.

**Q: How long will training take?**
**A**: 90 minutes on Oct 23, 60 minutes on Oct 25. Then daily 15-minute standups during pilot. We respect your time!

**Q: Can I opt out if I hate it?**
**A**: During the pilot, yes. We want willing participants. But give it a fair shot—most operators love it after Day 3 once they get the rhythm.
