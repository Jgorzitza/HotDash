## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: OpenAI API outage  
**Mitigation**: Fallback to manual queue, on-call engineering support

**Risk**: Knowledge base gaps  
**Mitigation**: Daily KB updates during pilot, Support Agent dedicated 50% time

**Risk**: Poor draft quality  
**Mitigation**: Start with 10% traffic, iterate prompts daily based on rejections

### Operational Risks

**Risk**: Operator resistance  
**Mitigation**: Careful selection, training, emphasize augmentation not replacement

**Risk**: Customer experience degradation  
**Mitigation**: Human approval required, exclude high-risk inquiries, monitor CSAT daily

### Timeline Risks

**Risk**: 3-4 day development timeline is aggressive  
**Mitigation**: MVP scope only, accept imperfect v1.0, iterate post-pilot
