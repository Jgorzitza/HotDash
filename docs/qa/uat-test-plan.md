5. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensure consistent experience across browsers

## Scope

### In Scope
- Dashboard tile functionality
- Data visualization and accuracy
- Navigation and user flows
- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Mock data validation

### Out of Scope
- Live data integration testing (handled in separate staging tests)
- Backend API performance testing
- Security testing
- Load testing

## Test Environment

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Dashboard Overview (Critical)
**Objective**: Verify CEO can quickly understand business status
**Preconditions**: User logged into dashboard
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Review all 6 tiles (Ops Pulse, Sales Pulse, Fulfillment Flow, Inventory Watch, CX Pulse, SEO Pulse)
3. Verify data displays correctly
4. Check responsive layout

**Expected Results**:
- All tiles load within 3 seconds
- Data is clearly visible and understandable
- No errors or broken elements
- Layout adapts to screen size

### Scenario 2: Data Drill-down (High)
**Objective**: Test detailed data exploration capabilities
**Preconditions**: Dashboard loaded successfully
**Steps**:
1. Click on Sales Pulse tile (if modal available)
2. Review detailed sales data
3. Navigate back to main dashboard
4. Test other tile interactions

**Expected Results**:
- Modal/dialog interactions work smoothly
- Data drill-down provides valuable insights
- Navigation maintains context

### Scenario 3: Mobile Responsiveness (High)
**Objective**: Ensure mobile experience is acceptable
**Preconditions**: Dashboard accessible on mobile device
**Steps**:

2. Test tile visibility and readability
3. Verify touch interactions work
4. Check landscape/portrait orientation

**Expected Results**:
- All content fits mobile viewport
- Text remains readable
- Touch targets are appropriately sized
- No horizontal scrolling required

### Scenario 4: Error Handling (Medium)
**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling
**Preconditions**: Dashboard loaded
**Steps**:
1. Test network disconnection scenarios
2. Verify error messages are user-friendly
3. Check data refresh behavior

**Expected Results**:
