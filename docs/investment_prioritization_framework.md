## RICE Scoring Framework

**Reach**: How many customers/users affected?
**Impact**: How much will it improve their experience? (3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low)
**Confidence**: How sure are we? (100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low)
**Effort**: Person-weeks required

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

**Example: Bulk Approve Feature**:
- Reach: 200 power users
- Impact: 2 (high time savings)
- Confidence: 80%
- Effort: 2 weeks

**RICE** = (200 × 2 × 0.8) / 2 = **160**

**Priority**: Score >100 = high priority
