# Launch Prep Quick Wins

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Designer:** Designer Agent
**Source:** `docs/design/phase-1-8-design-audit.md`
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

Executed 3 quick wins from the design audit to polish the UI before launch. Total time: 1 hour.

## Quick Win 1: Fix Toast Z-Index (H1) ✅

**Issue:** Toast notifications appeared above modals (z-index 10000 vs 9999), breaking visual hierarchy.

**Fix:** Set toast z-index to 9998 (below modals at 9999)

**File:** `app/components/notifications/ToastContainer.tsx`

**Change:**
```tsx
// Before
zIndex: 10000,

// After
zIndex: 9998, // Below modals (9999) - Design Audit H1
```

**Impact:** Modals now properly layer above toasts, maintaining correct visual hierarchy.

**Effort:** 15 minutes

## Quick Win 2: Fix Pulse Animation (H2) ✅

**Issue:** Pulse animation duration inconsistent (LiveBadge 1s vs ConnectionIndicator 2s)

**Fix:** Standardized all pulse animations to 2s

**File:** `app/components/realtime/LiveBadge.tsx`

**Change:**
```tsx
// Before
animation: isPulsing || showPulse ? "occ-pulse 1s ease-in-out" : undefined,

// After
animation: isPulsing || showPulse ? "occ-pulse 2s ease-in-out" : undefined, // Standardized to 2s - Design Audit H2
```

**Impact:** Consistent pulse animation across all real-time indicators.

**Effort:** 15 minutes

---

## Quick Win 3: Standardize Button Arrows (M3) ✅

**Issue:** Navigation buttons inconsistently used arrows (→). Some "View Details" buttons had arrows, others didn't.

**Fix:** Added arrows to all navigation buttons

**Files:**
- `app/components/ActionQueueCard.tsx`
- `app/components/attribution/AttributionPanel.tsx`

**Changes:**
```tsx
// Before
<button>View Details</button>

// After
<button>View Details →</button>
```

**Pattern Established:**
- **Navigation buttons** (go to another page): "View Details →", "View All Posts →"
- **Action buttons** (perform action): "Approve", "Save", "Delete" (no arrow)
- **Cancel buttons**: "Cancel", "Close", "Back" (no arrow)

**Impact:** Clear visual distinction between navigation and action buttons.

**Effort:** 30 minutes
