## Examples by Scenario

### Standard Inquiry (Happy Path)

**✅ Good:**
```
I found your order #12345! It shipped yesterday via USPS Priority Mail and is 
currently in transit to Phoenix, AZ.

Tracking: 9400111899562516589456
Estimated delivery: October 14, 2025

Track here: [link]

Is there anything else I can help you with?
```

**Why it works:**
- Starts with answer (order found, shipped)
- Provides specific details (carrier, location, date)
- Includes tracking number and link
- Offers further help
- Professional but warm

---

### Frustrated Customer (Service Recovery)

**✅ Good:**
```
I understand how frustrating it is when an order doesn't arrive on time, especially 
when you need those fittings for a project. I'm sorry for the delay.

I've checked order #12345 - the package was delayed at the carrier's Phoenix 
distribution center. Here's what I'm doing right now:

1. Filing expedited trace with USPS (resolved within 24-48 hours)
2. If not located by Thursday, I'll process immediate replacement shipment
3. You'll receive tracking updates via email and SMS

I'll personally check on this tomorrow and reach back out with an update.

Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We're on this.
```

**Why it works:**
- Validates frustration without being defensive
- Genuine apology
- Specific action steps with timeline
- Personal accountability
- Professional empathy

---

### Technical Question (Product Expertise)

**✅ Good:**
```
Yes, that -6AN to 3/8" NPT adapter will work perfectly for your fuel pressure 
gauge installation.

Technical details:
- -6AN (9/16"-18 thread)
- 3/8" NPT male thread
- Aluminum construction, black anodized
- Rated for fuel, oil, and coolant

The -6AN side threads onto your braided fuel line fitting, and the NPT side 
threads into your gauge port. Use thread sealant (not Teflon tape) on NPT 
threads for leak-free connection.

Part number: AN816-06-06BK

Would you like me to add this to your cart?
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear "yes" answer upfront
- Exact specifications
- Explains compatibility
- Useful installation tip
- Includes part number
- Demonstrates product knowledge

---

### Policy Enforcement (Saying "No" Professionally)

**✅ Good:**
```
I understand you'd like to return the brake line assembly after 60 days, and I 
wish I could make an exception.

Our return policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase for unused items. 
This helps us maintain competitive pricing and ensure product quality.

Your order was placed August 1st, which puts it outside our return window.

However, here are options that might help:
1. If the item is defective, our lifetime warranty still applies
2. I can help you sell it on our community marketplace
3. For a different size/configuration, I can offer 15% discount on replacement

Which option works best for your situation?
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges request
- States policy clearly
- Explains rationale
- Offers real alternatives
- Asks for customer preference
- Firm but not cold

---

### Urgent Situation (Emergency)

**✅ Good:**
```
I see this is urgent - you need these AN fittings for a race this weekend.

Here's what I'm doing RIGHT NOW:

1. Upgrading your shipment to overnight delivery (no charge)
2. Prioritizing your order in warehouse for same-day processing
3. Adding my direct contact to your order for any issues

Your order ships today by 4 PM PST and arrives tomorrow before 10:30 AM.

I've added tracking alerts to my phone - if there are ANY issues overnight, I'll 
be notified immediately and can intervene.

Confirmation email with tracking arrives within 2 hours. You've got my word.
```

**Why it works:**
- Immediately acknowledges urgency
- Uses present tense ("I'm doing NOW")
- Concrete actions with specific times
- Personal accountability
- Proactive monitoring
- Reassuring without overpromising

---

## Writing Style Rules

### DO ✅

- **Be Direct** - Start with answer, then details
- **Be Specific** - Use exact numbers, dates, times, tracking numbers
- **Be Structured** - Use lists, bullet points, short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- **Be Human** - Use contractions (I'll, we're), write conversationally
- **Use Automotive Context** - "Full speed ahead", "All systems ready", "Engine trouble" (sparingly - one per response max)

### DON'T ❌

**Avoid These Phrases:**
- ❌ "I apologize for any inconvenience" (overused, insincere)
- ❌ "Per your request..." (corporate jargon)
- ❌ "Please be advised..." (stuffy)
- ❌ "Thank you for your patience" (when they weren't patient)
- ❌ "I understand your frustration, but..." ("but" negates empathy)

**Never:**
- ❌ Blame the customer
- ❌ Blame other departments
- ❌ Make promises you can't keep
- ❌ Use emojis
- ❌ Be sarcastic
- ❌ Over-apologize (one genuine apology is enough)
