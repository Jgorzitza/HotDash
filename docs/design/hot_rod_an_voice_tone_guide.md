## Part 2: Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Automotive Expertise First**

#### 2. **Operator Empowerment**
- ✅ DO: Position operator as expert decision-maker
- ✅ DO: Frame AI as helpful assistant
- ❌ DON'T: Suggest AI replaces human judgment
- ❌ DON'T: Over-automate without approval

**Example**:
- ✅ "AI suggests a reorder of 144 units. You decide."

#### 3. **Growth-Minded Language**
- ✅ DO: Focus on scaling ($1MM to $10MM)
- ✅ DO: Emphasize time savings and efficiency

#### 4. **Transparency & Trust**

---

## Part 6: Localization & Translation

### Translation Challenges

**Automotive Terminology**:
- AN fittings (AN = Army-Navy spec) - Keep as "AN" globally
- LS swap - Engine swap type, may not translate culturally
- Hot rod - US-centric car culture term

**Cultural References**:
- Hot rod culture primarily US-based
- Gearhead language may not resonate globally
- Racing/automotive metaphors vary by region

### Translation Strategy

**What to Translate**:
- Functional UI text
- Instructions and help content
- Error messages (with cultural adaptation)
- Generic marketing messages

**What NOT to Translate**:
- Product names (AN fittings, specific parts)
- Technical specifications
- Brand name (Hot Rod AN)
- Industry-standard terms (LS swap, fuel line, brake line)

**Regional Adaptations**:

**Canada (FR)**:
- Keep automotive terms in EN where standard
- Translate interface and instructions
- Adapt measurements (metric awareness)

**Europe**:
- Automotive culture varies (UK vs. DE vs. FR)
- May need less "hot rod" branding
- Focus on professional operator voice

**Example**:
- EN: "Never run out of -6 AN adapters for LS swap fuel lines"
- FR-CA: "Ne manquez jamais de adaptateurs AN -6 pour lignes de carburant LS swap"
  - (Keep "AN -6" and "LS swap" untranslated)
