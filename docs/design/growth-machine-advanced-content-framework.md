# Growth Machine Advanced Content Framework

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Owner:** Localization  
**Created:** 2025-10-13  
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Advanced Growth Features  
**Purpose:** Content quality standards for advanced growth machine features

---

## Overview

Extends `growth-machine-content-quality-framework.md` to cover advanced features:
- Learning loop content optimization
- A/B testing content variants
- Performance repair recommendations
- Guided selling chat automation
- Automated content generation

---

## 1. Learning Loop Content Guidelines

### Content Optimization from Operator Feedback

**Process:**
1. **Collect**: Operator edits to AI-generated content
2. **Analyze**: Pattern recognition in edits (grammar, tone, facts)
3. **Learn**: Update templates based on successful patterns
4. **Validate**: Test updated templates with historical data
5. **Deploy**: Roll out improved templates incrementally

### Feedback-Driven Improvements

**Track for each template:**
- **Approval rate trend** (week-over-week improvement)
- **Edit patterns** (what operators consistently change)
- **Performance data** (which recommendations get accepted)
- **Success outcomes** (did the action achieve expected results)

**Example Learning Loop:**
```
Week 1: Product description template has 70% approval rate
Operators consistently edit: tone too formal, missing technical specs

Week 2: Template updated with casual tone + required specs
Approval rate improves to 85%

Week 3: Template further refined based on top-performing variants
Approval rate reaches 92%
```

### Content Quality Self-Improvement

**Automated refinement:**
- Templates that reach 95%+ approval → Auto-publish tier
- Templates below 70% approval → Pause for review
- Templates with consistent edit patterns → Auto-update suggestions
- High-performing content → Become training examples

---

## 2. A/B Testing Content Variants

### Content Variant Testing Framework

**Purpose**: Systematically test content variations to optimize performance

**Test Structure:**
```yaml
Test: Product Description A/B
Variants:
  A (Control): Current template with technical specs first
  B (Test): Benefits-first template with specs below
  
Metrics:
  - Click-through rate
  - Add-to-cart rate
  - Conversion rate
  - Operator approval rate
  
Duration: 7 days
Sample Size: 100 products per variant
```

### Automotive Voice A/B Testing

**Test Variations:**

**Version A: Subtle Automotive**
```
Action: Optimize fuel pressure regulator product page

Performance: This page has 890 monthly searches but ranks position 12.

Recommendation: Update title tag and add installation guide. Expected impact: 
40% visibility boost, 15-20 additional orders monthly.
```

**Version B: No Automotive Theme**
```
Action: Optimize fuel pressure regulator product page

Performance: High search volume (890/month) with low rankings (position 12).

Recommendation: Improve SEO title and add installation guide. Expected: 
40% better visibility, 15-20 more monthly orders.
```

**Test Metric**: Which version gets higher operator approval + action acceptance?

### Content Variation Guidelines

**DO Test:**
- ✅ Automotive terminology density (1 vs 2 vs 0 terms)
- ✅ Action phrasing ("Optimize" vs "Improve" vs "Fix")
- ✅ Data presentation (bullets vs paragraphs vs tables)
- ✅ Success metric framing (percentage vs absolute numbers)

**DON'T Test:**
- ❌ Grammar variations (always perfect grammar)
- ❌ Brand-off content (always on-brand)
- ❌ Unprofessional tone (always professional)
- ❌ Unclear actions (always specific and clear)

## 3. Performance Repair Recommendations

### Automated Performance Issue Detection

**Content for Performance Repair Actions:**

**Template: Underperforming Product Page**
```
🔧 Performance Issue Detected

Product: {{product_name}}
Issue: {{metric}} below benchmark by {{percentage}}

Root Cause: {{analysis}}
- Missing: {{missing_elements}}
- Weak: {{weak_elements}}
- Opportunity: {{opportunity}}

Recommended Fix:
1. {{action_1}} (Impact: {{impact_1}})
2. {{action_2}} (Impact: {{impact_2}})
3. {{action_3}} (Impact: {{impact_3}})

Expected Outcome: {{metric}} improves by {{target_improvement}}

Evidence: {{data_source}} analysis from {{date_range}}
```

**Example:**
```
🔧 Performance Issue Detected

Product: -6AN to 3/8" NPT Adapter (AN816-06-06BK)
Issue: Conversion rate 40% below category benchmark

Root Cause: Product page missing key information
- Missing: Installation instructions, compatibility chart
- Weak: Product images (only 2, should be 5+)
- Opportunity: High search volume but low product page engagement

Recommended Fix:
1. Add installation guide with images (Impact: +25% engagement)
2. Add 3 more product photos (Impact: +15% conversion)
3. Add compatibility chart for common applications (Impact: +20% add-to-cart)

Expected Outcome: Conversion rate improves from 2.1% to 3.5% (+67%)

Evidence: Google Analytics data from Oct 1-12, 2025
```

### Voice Guidelines for Performance Repair

**Keep Professional:**
- "Performance issue detected" (not "Problem found")
- "Below benchmark" (not "Performing badly")
- "Recommended fix" (not "You should fix")
- "Expected outcome" (not "This might help")

**Use Automotive Terms Appropriately:**
- ✅ "Tune-up needed" for minor optimizations
- ✅ "Boost performance" for improvement actions
- ✅ "Engine trouble" only for actual errors
- ❌ Don't force automotive terms in technical analysis
