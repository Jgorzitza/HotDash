## 1. Sentiment Analysis Accuracy Testing

### Implementation Details

The system uses two sentiment analysis approaches:

1. **AI-Powered (Chatbot Service)**
   - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for sentiment detection
   - Returns: positive, neutral, or negative
   - Integrated into inquiry analysis workflow

2. **Keyword-Based (Satisfaction Tracking Service)**
   - Uses predefined keyword lists
   - Positive keywords: great, excellent, good, helpful, thank, satisfied, happy
   - Negative keywords: terrible, awful, bad, horrible, disappointed, frustrated, angry
   - Fallback: neutral when no clear sentiment

### Test Coverage

**Test File:** `tests/integration/ai-customer/sentiment-analysis-accuracy.spec.ts`

**Total Test Cases:** 40+

#### Positive Sentiment Tests (10 cases)
- "Great service! Very helpful and professional."
- "Excellent response time, thank you so much!"
- "Happy with the product, good quality."
- "Satisfied with the support, very helpful team."
