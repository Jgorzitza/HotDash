- **Purpose**: Formats AI-generated draft responses with context for operators
- **Output**: Rich markdown note with emojis, confidence score, sources, sentiment

**2. Agent SDK Response Generation** (`apps/agent-service/src/agents/index.ts`)
- **Agents**: Triage, Order Support, Product Q&A
- **Tools**: RAG (answer_from_docs), Shopify, Chatwoot
- **Instructions**: Empathetic, policy-aware, approval-required responses

**3. Response Quality Checker** (`apps/agent-service/src/quality/response-checker.ts`)
- **Checks**: Length, profanity, empathy, clarity, actionable steps, formatting
- **Scoring**: 0-100 scale, requires 60+ to pass, 80+ for auto-send
- **Validation**: Prohibits placeholder text, ensures professional tone
