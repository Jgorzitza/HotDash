## Critical Blocker

### üî¥ P0: Staging Environment Down

**Severity**: P0 - Critical (Launch Blocker)  
**Impact**: Cannot conduct user testing  
**Status**: Open  
**Discovered**: 2025-10-24

**Description**:
The staging environment at https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev is returning 502 Bad Gateway errors and is not accessible. This blocks all user testing activities.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/health
2. Observe 502 error
3. Wait 27+ seconds for timeout

**Expected Behavior**:
- Staging environment responds with 200 OK
- Health check returns success status
- Dashboard loads in < 3 seconds

**Actual Behavior**:
- 502 Bad Gateway error
- No response body
- 27+ second timeout

**Impact**:
- **Cannot conduct user testing sessions**
- Cannot verify critical fixes (AppProvider crash, missing tiles)
- Cannot validate UI/UX improvements
- Cannot test mobile experience
- Cannot test accessibility features
- **Blocks production launch readiness**

**Recommendation**:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Investigate staging environment failure
2. Check Fly.io app status: `fly status -a hotdash-staging`
3. Check Fly.io logs: `fly logs -a hotdash-staging --limit 100`
4. Restart staging app if needed: `fly apps restart hotdash-staging`
5. Verify deployment succeeded
6. Re-run health check
7. Resume user testing once environment is healthy

**Owner**: DevOps  
**Priority**: P0 - Fix immediately  
**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 hours

## What We Can Do Without Staging

### 1. Local Testing (Alternative)

**Option**: Run user testing on local development environment

**Pros**:
- Can test immediately
- Full control over environment
- Can debug issues in real-time

**Cons**:
- Not production-like
- May have different behavior than staging
- Requires local setup for each user

**Recommendation**: Use as backup if staging cannot be fixed quickly

---

### 2. Automated Testing

**Option**: Run Playwright tests in mock mode

**Command**:
```bash
npx playwright test --project=mock-mode
```

**What This Tests**:
- Dashboard loads correctly
- Tiles are visible
- Modals open without crashes
- Navigation works
- Basic user flows

**Limitation**: Not a substitute for real user testing

---

### 3. Code Review

**Option**: Review code for critical fixes

**Focus Areas**:
- Verify AppProvider configuration in `app/routes/app.tsx`
- Verify tile rendering logic in `app/routes/app._index.tsx`
- Check for console errors in browser
- Review recent deployments

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Hours)

1. **Fix Staging Environment** (P0)
   - Investigate 502 error
   - Check Fly.io app status
   - Review deployment logs
   - Restart app if needed
   - Verify health check passes

2. **Verify Critical Fixes** (P0)
   - Once staging is up, verify AppProvider crash is fixed
   - Verify all 8 tiles are visible
   - Test modal interactions
   - Test mobile responsiveness

3. **Run Automated Tests** (P1)
   - Run Playwright tests in mock mode
   - Verify no regressions
   - Check for console errors
   - Validate performance

---

### Short-Term Actions (Next 24 Hours)

4. **Schedule User Testing Sessions** (P1)
   - Once staging is verified healthy
   - Recruit 5 users
   - Schedule 60-minute sessions
   - Prepare recording tools

5. **Conduct User Testing** (P1)
   - Run 6 test scenarios
   - Document bugs and issues
   - Collect quantitative metrics
   - Gather qualitative feedback

6. **Compile Findings** (P1)
   - Create bug report

### Alternative Plan (If Staging Cannot Be Fixed)

**Option A: Local Testing**
- Set up local environment for each user
- Run tests on localhost
- Document any environment-specific issues

**Option B: Delay User Testing**
- Fix staging environment first
- Reschedule user testing sessions
- Use extra time to prepare better

**Option C: Production Testing (Risky)**
- Test on production after launch
- Monitor closely for issues
- Have rollback plan ready

**Recommendation**: Fix staging (Option A backup, avoid Option C)

## Risk Assessment

### Launch Risks

**üî¥ HIGH RISK**: Staging environment instability
- If staging is unstable, production may be too
- Need to investigate root cause
- May indicate deployment issues

**üî¥ HIGH RISK**: Cannot verify critical fixes
- AppProvider crash fix not verified
- Missing tiles fix not verified
- May still have launch blockers

**üü° MEDIUM RISK**: Delayed user testing
- Less time for fixes before launch
- May miss important usability issues
- Reduced confidence in launch readiness

**üü¢ LOW RISK**: Test plan quality
- Comprehensive test plan created
- Good coverage of scenarios
- Ready to execute when unblocked
