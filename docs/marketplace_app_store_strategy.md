## Vision

Create a marketplace where developers build extensions/integrations for HotDash Agent SDK, similar to Shopify App Store or Salesforce AppExchange.

**Examples**:
- "Sentiment Analysis Pro" (advanced sentiment detection)
- "Multi-Language Pack" (20+ languages)
- "Shopify Deep Integration" (order management)
- "Voice Support Assistant" (phone call transcription)

**Revenue Model**: 70% to developer, 30% to HotDash

**Timeline**: Launch Q3 2027 (after multi-agent success)
