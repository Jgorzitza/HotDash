# Press Release - HotDash Operator Control Center for Shopify

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## HotDash Launches Operator Control Center: Unified Dashboard for Shopify Merchants Eliminates Tab Fatigue with AI-Assisted Approvals

*Five-tile dashboard embedded in Shopify Admin provides real-time operational visibility across CX, sales, inventory, SEO, and fulfillment with human-approved AI actions*

**[CITY, STATE] – [DATE]** — HotDash today announced the launch of Operator Control Center, a unified dashboard for Shopify merchants that consolidates customer experience, sales, inventory, SEO, and fulfillment monitoring into a single interface embedded directly in Shopify Admin. The platform combines real-time operational intelligence with AI-suggested actions that require human approval, enabling e-commerce operators to identify and resolve issues faster without tab switching.

### Solving the Tab Fatigue Problem

E-commerce operators typically juggle multiple tools to monitor their business: Shopify Admin for orders, Google Analytics for traffic, support platforms for customer issues, spreadsheets for inventory, and fulfillment dashboards for shipping. This fragmentation leads to delayed issue detection, context loss, and operator burnout.

"The average Shopify merchant has 10-15 tabs open just to understand how their business is performing," said [CEO Name], Founder of HotDash. "Important issues get buried. By the time you notice a stockout or traffic drop, you've already lost revenue. We built Operator Control Center to surface what matters, right now, in one place."

### Five Tiles, One Dashboard

Operator Control Center organizes operational intelligence into five focused tiles:

**1. CX Escalations**: Identifies customer conversations at risk of missing SLA targets and suggests AI-drafted replies for operator approval.

**2. Sales Pulse**: Tracks current day orders against 7-day rolling average, flagging significant deviations and potential fulfillment bottlenecks.

**3. Inventory Heatmap**: Monitors stock levels using velocity-based calculations, alerting operators to potential stockouts and suggesting reorder quantities.

**4. SEO & Content Watch**: Connects to Google Analytics to monitor top landing pages for week-over-week traffic changes exceeding 20%.

**5. Fulfillment Health**: Flags orders stuck in processing for 48+ hours, enabling proactive customer communication.

### Human-in-the-Loop AI

Rather than fully automating decisions, Operator Control Center uses human-in-the-loop AI where operators approve all customer-facing actions.

"We chose augmentation over automation," explained [Product Lead Name]. "AI is excellent at monitoring data and flagging issues. Humans are essential for judgment calls and customer communication. Our approval workflow combines the best of both."

All AI-suggested actions appear in an approval queue with full context, allowing operators to review, edit, or reject before execution. Every decision is logged in a complete audit trail.

### Beta Program Results

During a 3-month beta with 20 Shopify merchants, operators reported:

- **Time savings**: 3-5 hours per week from reduced tab switching
- **Proactive operations**: Issues detected 2-3 days earlier on average
- **Decision quality**: Increased confidence in operational decisions due to unified data view
- **Reduced stress**: Operators report feeling more in control, less reactive

"Before Operator Control Center, I'd find out about stockouts when customers complained," said Riley Chen, operator at Evergreen Outfitters, a beta participant. "Now I see low-stock alerts 2-3 days ahead and can reorder proactively. It's completely changed how we operate."

### Shopify-Native Integration

Operator Control Center is embedded directly in Shopify Admin as an app, requiring no separate login or additional tools.

"Shopify merchants already live in Shopify Admin," said [Product Lead]. "We brought the control center to them instead of asking them to go elsewhere. It's embedded, fast, and uses data they already have permission to access."

### Technical Implementation

The platform is built using:
- **React Router 7** for modern web app architecture
- **Supabase** for backend and real-time data
- **OpenAI and LlamaIndex** for AI-assisted insights
- **Google Analytics Direct API** for traffic monitoring
- **Chatwoot** for customer message integration

All infrastructure runs on Fly.io with auto-scaling and redundancy.

### Availability and Pricing

Operator Control Center is available today in the Shopify App Store. Pricing starts at $[X]/month with a 14-day free trial. No credit card required for trial.

The app is currently English-only, with additional language support planned for 2025.
