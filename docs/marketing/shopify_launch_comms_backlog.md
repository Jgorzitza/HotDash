# Shopify Launch Communications Backlog

## Snapshot ‚Äî 2025-10-10
- Copy across core surfaces (banner, email, blog) approved per `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md`; distribution timing hinges on product go-live window.
- Tooltip placement annotations still pending from design; engineering handoff queued once overlays arrive.
- Campaign calendar + evidence bundle waiting on product launch window and full Supabase telemetry export; staging Supabase + Shopify secrets now vaulted (`vault/occ/supabase/*`, `vault/occ/shopify/*`) and synced to GitHub `staging`.
- Supabase parity (2025-10-10 01:25Z) and Fly staging smoke (2025-10-10 02:31Z) logged; readiness evidence now available for comms packet references.

## Blockers & Escalations
- **Product launch window:** No response since 2025-10-09 20:25 ET follow-up. Escalate to manager if silence persists past 2025-10-10 14:00 UTC.
- **Design tooltip overlays:** Commitment to deliver 2025-10-10 AM ET; marketing to notify engineering immediately once received.
- **Telemetry dependencies:** Supabase staging secrets + parity artifact delivered (see `feedback/reliability.md`, `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json`); still waiting on full NDJSON export + KPI rerun before shipping comms narrative.

## Notes
- Restart cycle alignment complete per `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`; marketing backlog now mirrors sprint focus in `docs/directions/marketing.md`.
- Once blockers clear, update this backlog and attach evidence links in `feedback/marketing.md` as required by direction canon.
- Launch comms packet now includes placeholders for tooltip overlays, `?mock=0` smoke, and refreshed NDJSON (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`) so evidence can slot in immediately after QA sign-off; enablement mirrored the same table in `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`.
