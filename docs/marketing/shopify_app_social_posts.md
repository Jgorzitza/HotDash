## LinkedIn Launch Post

**Post Time**: Launch day, 9 AM EST  
**Format**: Long-form post with image

**Post Text**:

```
üöÄ Today we're launching HotDash‚Äîyour Operator Control Center for Shopify.

After 6 months of building, we're finally sharing what we've been working on.

THE PROBLEM:

Running a Shopify store means juggling 10+ browser tabs:
‚Üí Shopify Admin (orders, customers)
‚Üí Google Analytics (traffic, conversions)
‚Üí Support inbox (customer escalations)
‚Üí Inventory spreadsheets
‚Üí Fulfillment dashboards

You're constantly context-switching. Important issues get buried. You find out about problems too late.

THE SOLUTION:

Operator Control Center unifies everything into one dashboard with 5 tiles:

‚úì **CX Escalations** ‚Äî Spot SLA breaches, approve AI-suggested replies
‚úì **Sales Pulse** ‚Äî Today's orders vs. 7-day average at a glance  
‚úì **Inventory Heatmap** ‚Äî Low-stock alerts with reorder recommendations
‚úì **SEO & Content Watch** ‚Äî Catch pages losing >20% traffic week-over-week
‚úì **Fulfillment Health** ‚Äî Flag shipping blockers before customers call

Each tile surfaces the truth, pairs it with an action, and lets you approve with one tap.

THE APPROACH:

We built this operator-first:
‚Üí No training required (intuitive design)
‚Üí AI suggests, you approve (human-in-the-loop)
‚Üí Shopify-native (embedded in Admin)
‚Üí Full audit trail (transparency)

THE RESULT:

Beta operators report:
‚Üí 3-5 hours saved per week (less tab switching)
‚Üí Catching issues days earlier (proactive vs reactive)
‚Üí Better decisions (data-driven, not gut-feeling)
‚Üí Sustainable pace (less firefighting)

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Most e-commerce dashboards are built for analysts, not operators. They show you 50 metrics and leave you to figure out what matters.

We show you the 5 things that need your attention RIGHT NOW. That's it.

This is the command center we wish we had when we were operating e-commerce businesses.

Available now in Shopify App Store: [link]

Built for operators who don't have time for vanity metrics.

## LinkedIn Post (Alternate/Secondary)

**Post Time**: Launch day + 1, 10 AM EST  
**Format**: Founder/product story

**Post Text**:

```
We just launched Operator Control Center for Shopify, and I want to share why we built it.

Two years ago, I was running an e-commerce business. My mornings looked like this:

‚Üí Open Shopify Admin (check orders)
‚Üí Open Google Analytics (check traffic)
‚Üí Open support inbox (check escalations)
‚Üí Open spreadsheet (check inventory)
‚Üí Open fulfillment dashboard (check shipping)

10+ tabs. 20 minutes just to understand "how's the business doing today?"

And inevitably, I'd miss something. A stockout I didn't catch early enough. A traffic drop I discovered too late. A customer escalation that sat too long.

I was reactive, not proactive. And it was exhausting.

So we built Operator Control Center‚Äîthe dashboard I wish I had:

**Five tiles that answer five questions**:
1. CX: Any customers needing urgent attention?
2. Sales: How's today vs. baseline?
3. Inventory: Any stockouts coming?
4. SEO: Any pages losing traffic?
5. Fulfillment: Any orders stuck?

That's it. No vanity metrics. No overwhelming charts.

Just: "Here's what needs your attention. Here's the action. Approve?"

AI does the monitoring and suggests actions. You make the final call. Full audit trail logs everything.

We tested this with 20 beta operators for 3 months. They reported:
‚Üí 3-5 hours saved per week
‚Üí Catching issues 2-3 days earlier
‚Üí Better operational decisions
‚Üí Less stress, more control

Today it's available to all Shopify merchants.

If you're tired of tab fatigue and want to operate proactively instead of reactively, this is for you.

Available in Shopify App Store: [link]

Built by operators, for operators.
