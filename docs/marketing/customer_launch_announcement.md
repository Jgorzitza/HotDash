🎯 INTRODUCING: OPERATOR CONTROL CENTER

Your new daily command center, embedded in Shopify Admin.

Five tiles that answer your five most important questions:

1. **CX Escalations**: Any customers needing urgent attention?

3. **Inventory Heatmap**: Any stockouts coming?
4. **SEO & Content Watch**: Any pages losing traffic?

Each tile surfaces an issue and pairs it with an action you can approve in one tap.

❓ QUICK FAQ

**Q: Is this replacing Shopify Admin?**  
A: No. It's embedded IN Shopify Admin. Think of it as a enhanced home page that shows what matters.

**Q: Do I need to learn new tools?**  
A: No. If you can use Shopify, you can use this. Setup is 5 minutes.

**Q: What if I don't want AI suggestions?**  
A: You can disable AI per tile or entirely. The dashboard still shows your data, just without AI insights.

**Q: How much does this cost?**  
A: Already included in your HotDash subscription. No additional cost.

**Q: What about my data privacy?**  
A: Your data stays secure. Same privacy policy as always. No data sold to third parties.
