## Where We Are Today (October 2025)

### Current State

**Platform**: Manual operator support workflows
- 10 support operators handling 12,000 tickets/month
- Average resolution time: 15.3 minutes
- Operator satisfaction: 6.8/10
- Customer CSAT: 4.2/5
- Cost per ticket: $8.20

**Technology Stack**:
- Chatwoot for customer communication

- Inventory API (Port 8004)
- No AI automation

**Pain Points**:
- Operators spend 68% of time on repetitive tasks (searching, typing)
- Context switching across 6 different systems
- Inconsistent response quality
- Scaling requires linear headcount increase

- Average resolution time: 8.0 minutes (-48%)
- Operator satisfaction: 8.8/10
- Customer CSAT: 4.6/5
- Cost per ticket: $5.10 (-38%)

**Technology Stack**:

- LlamaIndex-powered knowledge base
- OpenAI GPT-4 for multi-agent responses
- Real-time metrics dashboards
- Learning loop for continuous improvement

**Transformation**:

                    Manual knowledge base
                    Repetitive typing
```

### Future Architecture (AI-Augmented)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Operators Reject AI

**Probability**: Low (careful design, approval queue)
**Impact**: Critical (product fails if operators don't use it)

**Mitigation**:
- Approval queue keeps operators in control
- Training emphasizes augmentation, not replacement
- Continuous feedback and iteration
- Kill switch available if needed

**Success Indicator**: Operator satisfaction >8.5/10

---

### Risk 2: AI Quality Doesn't Improve

**Probability**: Low (GPT-4 is proven, learning loop designed)
**Impact**: High (low approval rates = failed ROI)

**Mitigation**:
- Learning loop improves continuously
- Weekly prompt optimization
- Knowledge base expansion
- Fine-tuning from operator edits

**Success Indicator**: Approval rate >75% by Month 12

---

### Risk 3: Competitive Response

**Probability**: High (competitors will copy)
**Impact**: Medium (first-mover advantage, but need to stay ahead)

**Mitigation**:
- Build operator-first moat (hard to replicate culture)
- Learning loop compounds advantage
- Fast iteration (ship features quickly)
- Strong customer relationships

**Success Indicator**: Customer retention >95%, NPS >50

---

### Risk 4: Customer Perception of "AI Support"

**Probability**: Medium (some customers distrust AI)
**Impact**: Low (operators review everything)

**Mitigation**:
- Transparency: "AI-assisted, human-approved"
- Operators handle all communication
- No customer-facing chatbots (initially)
- Results speak for themselves (faster, better support)

**Success Indicator**: CSAT maintained or improved (≥4.6/5)
