## Current Manual Workflow (Baseline)

### 5-Step Process

**Step 1: Read & Understand** (30-60 seconds)
- Read customer message
- Review conversation history in Chatwoot
- Check customer profile
- Identify inquiry type

**Step 2: Gather Context** (60-120 seconds)
- Look up order details (copy order # → paste into admin panel)
- Check payment status (navigate to payment processor)
- Review shipping status (external tracking site)
- Calculate return/refund eligibility (mental math or policy check)

**Step 3: Search Knowledge Base** (60-180 seconds)
- Open internal wiki in new tab
- Search for relevant policy (keyword search)
- Scan 3-5 articles to find right answer
- Copy relevant excerpts
- Check if policy is current (manual verification)

**Step 4: Draft Response** (120-300 seconds)
- Switch back to Chatwoot
- Compose response from scratch or generic template
- Personalize with customer name and order details
- Paste policy information
- Add tracking links manually
- Proofread for tone and accuracy

**Step 5: Verify & Send** (30-60 seconds)
- Double-check information accuracy
- Ensure appropriate tone
- Click send
- Tag conversation (shipping, refund, etc.)
- Mark status (resolved, pending, escalated)

### Total Time: 8.5 Minutes Average

**Time Breakdown**:
- 9% reading and understanding
- 18% gathering context
- 24% searching knowledge base
- 43% drafting response
- 9% verifying and sending

### Pain Points

1. **Context Switching**: 6 different systems per inquiry (Chatwoot, wiki, admin, payment, shipping, docs)
2. **Manual Search**: Keyword search often returns irrelevant results (72% accuracy)
3. **Repetitive Typing**: Writing similar responses 10-15 times per day
4. **Information Hunting**: Clicking through 4-5 pages to gather order details
5. **Knowledge Gaps**: Uncertainty about policy accuracy or currentness

## Agent SDK Automated Workflow (Future State)

### Simplified 2-Step Process

**Step 1: AI Processing** (5-10 seconds, automatic)
- Understands customer intent via GPT-4
- Fetches order/payment/shipping data via APIs (automatic)
- Queries LlamaIndex for relevant knowledge base articles
- Generates personalized draft response
- Calculates confidence score
- Adds source citations

**Step 2: Operator Review** (30-90 seconds)
- Read AI-generated draft in approval queue
- Verify order details are correct
- Check tone and empathy level
- Take action:
  - **Approve** (5 seconds): One-click send
  - **Edit & Approve** (30-60 seconds): Minor adjustments, then send
  - **Escalate** (10 seconds): One-click route to senior support
  - **Reject** (180+ seconds): Write response manually (rare, <5%)

### Total Time: 1.5 Minutes Average

**Weighted Average** (based on projected distribution):
- 60% approve (no edits): 35 seconds
- 35% edit & approve: 60 seconds
- 5% reject (manual fallback): 300 seconds

= (0.60 × 35) + (0.35 × 60) + (0.05 × 300) = **57 seconds ≈ 1 minute**

**Plus AI processing time**: ~10 seconds
**Total**: ~70 seconds ≈ **1.2 minutes**
**Conservative estimate**: **1.5 minutes**
