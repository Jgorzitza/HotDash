## MCP Tools for Feedback Collection

### Supabase MCP

**Store feedback in database**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ceo_feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id UUID,
  feedback_type VARCHAR(20), -- daily_log, weekly_survey, monthly_review
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  time_saved_hours DECIMAL,
  satisfaction_score INT,
  top_win TEXT,
  top_issue TEXT,
  feature_request TEXT,
  nps_score INT,
  raw_feedback JSONB
);
```

**Query for patterns**:
```sql
-- Top requested features (last 30 days)
SELECT 
  feature_request,
  COUNT(*) as request_count
FROM ceo_feedback
WHERE feedback_type IN ('daily_log', 'weekly_survey')
  AND feature_request IS NOT NULL
  AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY feature_request
ORDER BY request_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
