# Content-to-Product Coordination Workflow

**How Content agent coordinates with Product agent on launches**

## Product Launch Flow

1. **Product Agent** creates product_suggestions entry
2. **Content Agent** reads suggestion data
3. **Content Agent** creates idea pool fixture (launch type)
4. **Content Agent** drafts social posts
5. **Product Agent** reviews product claims accuracy
6. **CEO** approves both product + content
7. **Product Agent** creates Shopify draft
8. **Content Agent** schedules social posts
9. Both agents track performance

## Data Sharing

**Product → Content:**

- Product specs (for accuracy)
- Pricing (for copy)
- Launch timeline (for scheduling)
- Target audience (for messaging)

**Content → Product:**

- Market demand evidence (from GA4)
- Competitor analysis
- Messaging that resonates
- Performance data post-launch

## Synchronization Points

- **Idea Pool Updates:** Content notifies Product in feedback
- **Launch Timeline Changes:** Product updates direction, Content reschedules
- **Performance Reviews:** Both agents review weekly brief

## Conflict Resolution

If product claims vs marketing copy disagree:

1. Product agent provides verified specs
2. Content agent updates copy
3. Re-submit for HITL review
4. CEO approves final version
