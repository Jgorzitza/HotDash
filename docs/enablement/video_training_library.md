### Update Workflow

**1. Identify Update Need**
- Change in product/policy
- Operator feedback
- Quality review finding
- Scheduled refresh

**2. Assess Scope**
- Minor (caption fix, annotation update)
- Moderate (re-record segment)
- Major (full re-record)

**3. Execute Update**
- **Minor:** Edit captions/annotations, replace
- **Moderate:** Record new segment, splice in, QA
- **Major:** Full re-production following standard workflow

**4. Version Control**
- Archive previous version
- Update version number
- Note changes in description
- Notify operators of update

**5. Redistribute**
- Replace in library index
- Email notification if major changes
- Update related documents

### Video Analytics & Iteration

**Track These Metrics:**

**Engagement:**
- View count
- Completion rate (% who watch to end)
- Average watch time
- Drop-off points (where viewers stop)

**Effectiveness:**
- Quiz scores after watching (are viewers learning?)
- Operator confidence ratings
- Correlation between views and performance
- Feedback ratings (helpful/not helpful)

**Usage Patterns:**
- Most viewed videos (high value)
- Least viewed videos (low awareness or low value?)
- Time of day viewed
- Repeat views (reference vs one-time learning)

**Use Data To:**
- Identify which videos need improvement (low completion)
- Prioritize new video topics (high demand)
- Retire low-value content
- Optimize video length (ideal duration analysis)
