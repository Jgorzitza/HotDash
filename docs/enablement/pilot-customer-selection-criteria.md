# Pilot Customer Selection Criteria

**Purpose**: Define criteria for selecting pilot customers for Agent SDK approval queue system  
**Target Audience**: Support managers, customer success team  
**Program**: Hot Rod AN Agent SDK Pilot  
**Created**: October 12, 2025

---

## 🎯 Pilot Program Overview

### What Is the Pilot?

**Program Name**: Agent SDK Approval Queue Pilot  
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Goal**: Validate AI-assisted customer support with real Hot Rod AN customers  
**Scope**: Selected customers receive AI-drafted responses (with human approval) via Chatwoot

**Success Metrics**:
- Response time improvement: Target 50% faster
- Customer satisfaction: Target >85% CSAT
- Operator efficiency: Target 2X more tickets handled
- AI accuracy: Target >70% approval rate (without modifications)

---

## 👥 Ideal Pilot Customer Profile

### Must-Have Criteria (All Required)

#### 1. Active Customer (Recent Purchase)
**Why**: Ensures they need support and can provide feedback
- ✅ Purchased within last 90 days
- ✅ OR has pending order
- ✅ OR is repeat customer (2+ orders in last year)

**Verification**:
```
Check Shopify:
- Order history: Last order date
- Total orders: Lifetime count
- Customer since: Account creation date
```

---

#### 2. Positive Customer History
**Why**: Pilot needs cooperative, patient customers who'll give honest feedback
- ✅ No past complaints or disputes
- ✅ No chargebacks or payment issues
- ✅ Previous interactions were positive
- ✅ Responsive to emails/messages

**Verification**:
```
Check Support History:
- Chatwoot conversations: Tone, responsiveness
- Shopify notes: Any red flags?
- Return history: Reasonable or problematic?
```

**Red Flags (Disqualify)**:
- ❌ History of angry/abusive messages
- ❌ Multiple return disputes
- ❌ Unrealistic expectations ("I need this yesterday!")
- ❌ Non-responsive (doesn't reply to emails)

---

#### 3. Technical Competency Level
**Why**: Need customers who can articulate feedback on AI responses
- ✅ **Intermediate to Advanced**: Best pilot candidates
  - Home mechanic with experience
  - DIY hot rod builder
  - Professional shop mechanic
- ⚠️ **Beginner**: Can include, but fewer
  - First-time AN fitting buyer
  - Learning as they go
- ❌ **Complete Novice**: Avoid for pilot
  - Has never worked on cars before
  - Needs extensive hand-holding

**Assessment**:
```
Review past support tickets:
- Do they ask informed questions?
- Do they understand technical terms?
- Can they describe their setup clearly?
```

---

#### 4. Communication Style
**Why**: Need articulate customers who can provide useful feedback
- ✅ Clear communicators
- ✅ Provides details (not just "it doesn't work")
- ✅ Asks good questions
- ✅ Responds in reasonable timeframes

**Good Example**:
```
Customer: "I'm installing AN-6 fittings on my '69 Camaro small block 
350. I have a Holley 750 CFM carb and an Aeromotive A1000 fuel pump. 
What size adapter do I need for the carburetor inlet?"
```
✅ Clear, detailed, specific question

**Bad Example**:
```
Customer: "fuel stuff"
```
❌ Vague, no context, can't provide useful feedback

---

### Nice-to-Have Criteria (Bonus Points)

#### 5. Enthusiasm for Technology ⭐
**Why**: More likely to appreciate AI assistance and provide constructive feedback
- ⭐ Mentions using tech tools (forums, YouTube, apps)
- ⭐ Early adopter mindset
- ⭐ Engaged on social media
- ⭐ Comfortable with email/chat

**Assessment**:
- Check if they reference online research
- Look for tech-savvy language in support tickets
- Social media presence (if available)

---

#### 6. Geographic Diversity ⭐
**Why**: Validate system across time zones and regions
- ⭐ US East Coast (EST)
- ⭐ US West Coast (PST)
- ⭐ Central US (CST)
- ⭐ International (if applicable)

**Goal**: At least 2 customers per major US time zone

---

#### 7. Use Case Diversity ⭐
**Why**: Test AI across different scenarios
- ⭐ Street/strip hot rod (most common)
- ⭐ Full race car
- ⭐ Restoration project
- ⭐ LS swap project
- ⭐ Classic muscle car

**Goal**: Mix of customer types to stress-test AI knowledge

---

#### 8. Order Value Mix ⭐
**Why**: Validate for both small and large customers
- ⭐ Small orders ($50-$200): Hobbyist
- ⭐ Medium orders ($200-$1,000): Serious builder
- ⭐ Large orders ($1,000+): Shop or pro builder

**Goal**: Representative sample across customer segments

---

## 🚫 Disqualifying Factors

### Do NOT Include Customers With:

**1. High-Risk Profile**
- ❌ History of legal threats
- ❌ Past chargebacks or fraud
- ❌ Demanding refunds outside policy
- ❌ Abusive language in past tickets

**2. Unrealistic Expectations**
- ❌ "I need this tomorrow!" (when ordered today)
- ❌ Demands impossible outcomes
- ❌ Blames us for their mistakes consistently

**3. Poor Communication**
- ❌ Doesn't respond to emails
- ❌ Extremely vague in requests
- ❌ Language barrier (if we can't communicate effectively)

**4. Recent Negative Experience**
- ❌ Just had a major complaint or issue
- ❌ Received wrong/defective product recently
- ❌ Currently in dispute resolution

**5. Time-Sensitive Situations**
- ❌ Has race this weekend (too urgent for pilot experimentation)
- ❌ Vehicle down for work/emergency
- ❌ Under deadline pressure

**Why Exclude**: Pilot may have hiccups. These customers need perfect service NOW, not experimental support.

### Customer Invitation Message (After Internal Screening)

**If Customer Qualifies, Send This**:

```
Subject: Invitation: Try Our New AI-Powered Support (Beta)

Hi [Customer Name],

We're launching a new AI-assisted support system at Hot Rod AN, and 
we'd love to have you as one of our first pilot testers!

**What's in it for you?**
• Faster response times (we're targeting 50% faster!)
• Same great support, with AI assistance
• Your feedback helps us improve for all customers
• Exclusive access to new features first

**What's different?**
When you contact us, our AI will draft responses based on our 
knowledge base and product expertise. A human operator (that's us!) 
still reviews and approves every message before it's sent to you.

**What we need from you:**
• Normal support questions (just like usual!)
• Occasional quick feedback: "Was this response helpful?"
• Optional: 10-minute survey at the end (we'll send a gift card!)

**Duration**: 4-6 weeks

**Interested?** Just reply "YES" and we'll enroll you! You can opt 
out anytime if it's not working for you.

Questions? Just ask!

Best,
[Support Manager Name]
Hot Rod AN Support Team

P.S. This is completely optional—we'll still provide amazing support 
whether you're in the pilot or not!
```

**Expected Response Rate**: 40-60% of invited customers will accept

---

### Post-Acceptance Confirmation

**Once Customer Accepts, Send**:

```
Subject: Welcome to the Hot Rod AN Support Pilot!

Hi [Customer Name],

Awesome! You're in! 🎉

**What Happens Now:**

1. **Normal Support**: Contact us the same way you always do 
   (email, Chatwoot, phone)

2. **AI-Assisted Responses**: We'll use AI to draft responses, 
   but a human (us!) reviews and approves before sending

3. **Quick Feedback**: Occasionally we'll ask: "Was this helpful?" 
   (2 seconds, one click)

4. **End Survey** (Optional): At the end, we'll send a 10-minute 
   survey + $25 Hot Rod AN gift card for your time

**You can opt out anytime** by replying "STOP PILOT" to any message.

**Got questions right now?** Send them over—let's test the system!
