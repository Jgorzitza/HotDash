# Pilot Customer Selection Criteria

**Purpose**: Define criteria for selecting pilot customers for Agent SDK approval queue system  
**Target Audience**: Support managers, customer success team  
**Program**: Hot Rod AN Agent SDK Pilot  
**Created**: October 12, 2025

---

## üéØ Pilot Program Overview

### What Is the Pilot?

**Program Name**: Agent SDK Approval Queue Pilot  
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Goal**: Validate AI-assisted customer support with real Hot Rod AN customers  
**Scope**: Selected customers receive AI-drafted responses (with human approval) via Chatwoot

**Success Metrics**:
- Response time improvement: Target 50% faster
- Customer satisfaction: Target >85% CSAT
- Operator efficiency: Target 2X more tickets handled
- AI accuracy: Target >70% approval rate (without modifications)

---

## üë• Ideal Pilot Customer Profile

### Must-Have Criteria (All Required)

#### 1. Active Customer (Recent Purchase)
**Why**: Ensures they need support and can provide feedback
- ‚úÖ Purchased within last 90 days
- ‚úÖ OR has pending order
- ‚úÖ OR is repeat customer (2+ orders in last year)

**Verification**:
```
Check Shopify:
- Order history: Last order date
- Total orders: Lifetime count
- Customer since: Account creation date
```

---

#### 2. Positive Customer History
**Why**: Pilot needs cooperative, patient customers who'll give honest feedback
- ‚úÖ No past complaints or disputes
- ‚úÖ No chargebacks or payment issues
- ‚úÖ Previous interactions were positive
- ‚úÖ Responsive to emails/messages

**Verification**:
```
Check Support History:
- Chatwoot conversations: Tone, responsiveness
- Shopify notes: Any red flags?
- Return history: Reasonable or problematic?
```

**Red Flags (Disqualify)**:
- ‚ùå History of angry/abusive messages
- ‚ùå Multiple return disputes
- ‚ùå Unrealistic expectations ("I need this yesterday!")
- ‚ùå Non-responsive (doesn't reply to emails)

---

#### 3. Technical Competency Level
**Why**: Need customers who can articulate feedback on AI responses
- ‚úÖ **Intermediate to Advanced**: Best pilot candidates
  - Home mechanic with experience
  - DIY hot rod builder
  - Professional shop mechanic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beginner**: Can include, but fewer
  - First-time AN fitting buyer
  - Learning as they go
- ‚ùå **Complete Novice**: Avoid for pilot
  - Has never worked on cars before
  - Needs extensive hand-holding

**Assessment**:
```
Review past support tickets:
- Do they ask informed questions?
- Do they understand technical terms?
- Can they describe their setup clearly?
```

---

#### 4. Communication Style
**Why**: Need articulate customers who can provide useful feedback
- ‚úÖ Clear communicators
- ‚úÖ Provides details (not just "it doesn't work")
- ‚úÖ Asks good questions
- ‚úÖ Responds in reasonable timeframes

**Good Example**:
```
Customer: "I'm installing AN-6 fittings on my '69 Camaro small block 
350. I have a Holley 750 CFM carb and an Aeromotive A1000 fuel pump. 
What size adapter do I need for the carburetor inlet?"
```
‚úÖ Clear, detailed, specific question

**Bad Example**:
```
Customer: "fuel stuff"
```
‚ùå Vague, no context, can't provide useful feedback

---

### Nice-to-Have Criteria (Bonus Points)

#### 5. Enthusiasm for Technology ‚≠ê
**Why**: More likely to appreciate AI assistance and provide constructive feedback
- ‚≠ê Mentions using tech tools (forums, YouTube, apps)
- ‚≠ê Early adopter mindset
- ‚≠ê Engaged on social media
- ‚≠ê Comfortable with email/chat

**Assessment**:
- Check if they reference online research
- Look for tech-savvy language in support tickets
- Social media presence (if available)

---

#### 6. Geographic Diversity ‚≠ê
**Why**: Validate system across time zones and regions
- ‚≠ê US East Coast (EST)
- ‚≠ê US West Coast (PST)
- ‚≠ê Central US (CST)
- ‚≠ê International (if applicable)

**Goal**: At least 2 customers per major US time zone

---

#### 7. Use Case Diversity ‚≠ê
**Why**: Test AI across different scenarios
- ‚≠ê Street/strip hot rod (most common)
- ‚≠ê Full race car
- ‚≠ê Restoration project
- ‚≠ê LS swap project
- ‚≠ê Classic muscle car

**Goal**: Mix of customer types to stress-test AI knowledge

---

#### 8. Order Value Mix ‚≠ê
**Why**: Validate for both small and large customers
- ‚≠ê Small orders ($50-$200): Hobbyist
- ‚≠ê Medium orders ($200-$1,000): Serious builder
- ‚≠ê Large orders ($1,000+): Shop or pro builder

**Goal**: Representative sample across customer segments

---

## üö´ Disqualifying Factors

### Do NOT Include Customers With:

**1. High-Risk Profile**
- ‚ùå History of legal threats
- ‚ùå Past chargebacks or fraud
- ‚ùå Demanding refunds outside policy
- ‚ùå Abusive language in past tickets

**2. Unrealistic Expectations**
- ‚ùå "I need this tomorrow!" (when ordered today)
- ‚ùå Demands impossible outcomes
- ‚ùå Blames us for their mistakes consistently

**3. Poor Communication**
- ‚ùå Doesn't respond to emails
- ‚ùå Extremely vague in requests
- ‚ùå Language barrier (if we can't communicate effectively)

**4. Recent Negative Experience**
- ‚ùå Just had a major complaint or issue
- ‚ùå Received wrong/defective product recently
- ‚ùå Currently in dispute resolution

**5. Time-Sensitive Situations**
- ‚ùå Has race this weekend (too urgent for pilot experimentation)
- ‚ùå Vehicle down for work/emergency
- ‚ùå Under deadline pressure

**Why Exclude**: Pilot may have hiccups. These customers need perfect service NOW, not experimental support.
