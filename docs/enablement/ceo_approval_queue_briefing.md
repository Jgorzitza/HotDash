## Session Outline

### [00:00-02:00] The Business Problem We're Solving

**Say:**

"Let me show you what we've built and why it matters for HotDash.

**The Challenge:**
Our support operators spend 60-80% of their time on repetitive tasks:
- Searching knowledge base for policy information
- Copy-pasting standard responses
- Looking up order statuses

Only 20-30% of time on what actually requires human judgment - complex issues, building customer relationships, solving real problems.

**The Opportunity:**
What if we flip this? Let AI handle the repetitive research and drafting, freeing operators to focus on high-value work.

That's what the Agent SDK approval queue does."

### [02:00-05:00] What It Is (Simple Demo)

**Say:**

"Here's how it works - it's beautifully simple.

**[Show screen: Approval queue interface]**

1. Customer sends inquiry: 'Where is my order?'

2. AI agent automatically:
   - Analyzes the question
   - Searches our knowledge base
   - Looks up the customer's order
   - Prepares a complete response draft

3. Operator reviews in this approval queue:
   - Reads customer's message
   - Reviews AI's prepared response
   - Checks: Is this accurate and helpful?
   - Decides: Approve or Reject

4. If approved - response sent immediately. If rejected - operator handles manually.

**[Quick 2-minute demo showing one approval flow]**

The whole review takes an operator 1-2 minutes. AI did the 5-minute research and drafting work.

That's the leverage."

### [05:00-08:00] Business Impact

**Say:**

"Here's what this means for HotDash:

**Operator Capacity:**
- Current: Operator handles ~20-30 inquiries per day
- With Agent SDK: Same operator handles 50-80 per day
- **2-3× capacity increase** without adding headcount

**Response Quality:**
- AI uses knowledge base 100% of the time (operators might miss articles)
- Consistent policy application across all responses
- Human review maintains quality and empathy

**Customer Experience:**
- Faster response times (AI drafts ready in seconds)
- More accurate (KB-backed responses)
- Still gets human judgment and empathy

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Current: ~$15 per resolved inquiry (operator time + overhead)
- With Agent SDK: ~$6 per resolved inquiry (AI research + operator review)
- **60% cost reduction** while improving quality

**Operator Experience:**
- Less time on repetitive work (boring)
- More time on complex problems (engaging)
- Higher job satisfaction (more meaningful work)
- Lower turnover (better retention)

**The Learning Loop:**
Every operator decision teaches the AI:
- Approvals → 'This approach works'
- Edits → 'Use this tone and style'
- Rejections → 'Don't do this'

AI gets better every week. In 3 months, approval rate should increase from 70% to 85%+ as AI learns."

### [08:00-11:00] Risk Management (They'll Ask)

**Say:**

"You're probably wondering about risks. We've designed this carefully:

**Human-in-the-Loop:**
- Operators approve EVERYTHING before it goes to customers
- AI never sends directly
- Quality gate maintained

**Escalation Safeguards:**
- High-value issues (>$100) → Require manager approval
- Threats (legal, social media) → Escalated to manager immediately
- Technical issues → Routed to engineering
- Uncertainty → Operators escalate rather than guess

**Knowledge Base Foundation:**
- AI only uses our verified knowledge base (not internet)
- LlamaIndex semantic search finds relevant articles
- Version-controlled policies (operators verify currency)

**Audit Trail:**
- Every approval/rejection logged in Supabase
- Full decision history for compliance
- Can review operator decisions for quality

**Pilot Approach:**
- Starting with 5-10 experienced operators
- Low volume (5-15 approvals per day)
- Close monitoring and feedback
- Expand only after validating success

**Rollback:**
If pilot doesn't work, operators continue using Chatwoot manually. No disruption to customer service.

This is low-risk, high-reward innovation."

### [11:00-13:00] Why Now / Competitive Context

**Say:**

"Why are we doing this now?

**Industry Trend:**
AI-assisted support is becoming table stakes. Companies like:
- Zendesk: AI assistance in all tiers
- Intercom: Fin AI answering customer questions
- Salesforce: Einstein for Support

Customers expect fast, accurate responses. Our competitors are using AI. We need this to stay competitive.

**HotDash Differentiation:**
Unlike competitors who automate fully (AI answers directly), we maintain human-in-the-loop:
- Better quality (human judgment)
- Better brand (human touch)
- Better operator experience (empowerment not replacement)

We're using AI to make our operators better, not to replace them.

**Strategic Alignment:**
This fits our operator-first philosophy. From our North Star:
- 'Operators are our internal customers'
- 'Automation should augment human capability, not replace judgment'
- 'Humans in the loop, not the loop'

This is us living our values through technology."

### [13:00-14:30] Pilot Plan & Timeline

**Say:**

"Here's the plan:

**Phase 1: Pilot (Next 2-4 weeks)**
- 5-10 operators
- Monitor closely
- Collect feedback
- Validate business case

**Phase 2: Expand (If pilot successful)**
- Roll out to all support operators
- Measure impact on key metrics
- Iterate based on learnings

**Phase 3: Optimize (Months 2-3)**
- AI learns and improves
- Approval rate increases
- Operator efficiency gains compound

**Success Metrics We're Tracking:**
- Operator capacity (target: 2× increase)
- Response time (target: 30% faster)
- Customer satisfaction (target: maintain or improve)
- Operator satisfaction (target: prefer this to manual)
- Cost per resolution (target: 40-60% reduction)

**Go/No-Go Decision:**
After pilot, we'll have data. If metrics validate business case, we expand. If not, we iterate or pause.

Evidence-driven decisions."

### [14:30-15:00] Q&A & Wrap-Up

**Anticipated Questions:**

**Q: "What if operators don't like it?"**
A: "Pilot tests this. Approval queue is optional - operators can still work manually. Early feedback is positive. If operators prefer manual, we'll know quickly and can adjust."

**Q: "What if AI makes a mistake that reaches a customer?"**
A: "Operators approve everything - they're the quality gate. But in pilot, if something slips through, we catch it fast with limited exposure (5-10 operators, low volume). That's why we pilot."

**Q: "What's the ROI timeline?"**
A: "If pilot validates our assumptions, ROI is immediate. We're not adding headcount but increasing capacity. Cost is primarily AI API calls (~$0.10 per inquiry). Savings are operator time (~$5-10 per inquiry). Payback in Month 1."

**Q: "How does this compare to fully automated AI (no human review)?"**
A: "Fully automated is higher risk (errors reach customers) and worse brand (no human touch). Human-in-the-loop gives us quality, safety, and differentiation. We maintain the HotDash experience while gaining AI efficiency."

**Closing:**

"This is strategic innovation aligned with our values. We're making operators' jobs better while improving customer experience and unit economics.

After the pilot, we'll share results and recommendations. Questions now?"
