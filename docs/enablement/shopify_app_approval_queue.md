## Video Script

### [00:00-00:20] Hook & Overview (20 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Meet the HotDash Approval Queue - where AI agents draft customer responses for you, and you approve, edit, or reject them. In this 3-minute video, I'll show you exactly how to review and approve AI-prepared responses. Let's get started!"

### [00:20-01:00] Understanding the Queue (40 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's your Approval Queue. At the top, you see statistics: pending approvals with priority breakdown. Priority badges show what needs attention first: Urgent in red, High Priority in orange, Normal in blue, and Low Priority in green. Always start with Urgent. Each card shows the customer's message, the AI-drafted response, confidence score, and action buttons. Confidence score tells you how confident the AI is. Ninety-five percent is high - usually trustworthy. Under 70% needs extra scrutiny. You have three options: Approve to send as-is, Edit to refine it, or Reject to write from scratch."

### [01:00-01:50] Approving a Response (50 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Let's approve a response. Here's a customer asking 'Where is my order?' The AI has prepared a reply with tracking information. Confidence is 92% - pretty high. Here's my quick review: Is it accurate? Yes. Does it answer the question? Yes. Is the tone appropriate? Yes. All three checks pass. So I click 'Approve' - and done! Response sent to the customer. That took 30 seconds. Most approvals are this simple."

### [01:50-02:25] When to Reject (35 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Now let's look at when to reject. Here's a customer asking about returns. AI says 'Our policy is 14 days, no exceptions'. Problem: our actual return policy is 30 days, not 14. The AI cited outdated information. This is factually wrong - we must reject it. I click 'Reject' and add a note: 'AI cited wrong policy - actual policy is 30 days'. This helps the AI learn. Never approve incorrect information."

### [02:25-02:50] Real-Time Features (25 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "The queue updates automatically every 10 seconds, so you always see the latest approvals. When a new urgent approval arrives, you'll get a notification. When you've cleared the queue, you'll see 'All caught up!' Your proactive work here prevents customer service issues and maintains quality responses."

### [02:50-03:00] Closing & Best Practices (10 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Best practice: check your approval queue every 2 hours during your shift. Prioritize Urgent first, then work down to Low Priority. When in doubt, reject or escalate - better safe than sorry! Happy approving!"
