## Video Script

### [00:00-00:15] Introduction (15 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Running into issues with HotDash? Don't worry - most problems have quick fixes. In this video, I'll show you solutions to the five most common issues: login problems, slow loading, missing data, approval errors, and dashboard not updating. Let's troubleshoot!"

### [00:15-00:50] Issue #1: Login Problems (35 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Issue 1: Can't access HotDash from your Shopify admin. Quick Fix: First, refresh your browser. Still not working? Clear your browser cache. Go to Settings, Privacy, Clear Browsing Data, select 'Cached images and files', then click Clear. Now try accessing HotDash again. This solves 90% of login issues. Still stuck? Log out of Shopify completely, log back in, then try HotDash."

### [00:50-01:25] Issue #2: Dashboard Loading Slowly (35 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Issue 2: Dashboard takes forever to load. Quick Fix: Check your internet connection first. Next, close unnecessary browser tabs - they consume memory. Try a hard refresh: Command-Shift-R on Mac or Control-Shift-F5 on Windows. If it's still slow, try using HotDash in a different browser. Sometimes browser extensions cause conflicts."

### [01:25-02:00] Issue #3: Missing or Incorrect Data (35 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Issue 3: Tiles show 'No data available' or numbers that don't match your Shopify admin. Quick Fix: Check when you installed HotDash. Initial data sync takes 15 to 30 seconds. For established stores, this usually means a temporary sync issue. Wait 5 minutes - HotDash syncs automatically. Still no data after 10 minutes? Click the refresh icon to force a manual sync."

### [02:00-02:40] Issue #4: Approval Queue Errors (40 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Issue 4: Clicked 'Approve' but the response didn't send. Quick Fix: Check if you're still connected to Chatwoot. HotDash needs Chatwoot integration to send responses. Open Chatwoot in a separate tab and verify you can see the conversation there. If Chatwoot works, try approving again. If the same approval fails twice, click 'Reject' and handle it manually in Chatwoot. Don't worry - no duplicate messages are sent."

### [02:40-03:20] Issue #5: Dashboard Not Updating (40 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Issue 5: Dashboard shows old data. Here's how updates work: Sales Pulse refreshes every 5 minutes. CX Escalations every 2 minutes. Fulfillment every 5 minutes. Inventory every 15 minutes. If data seems stale, check the 'Last updated' timestamp. Click the manual refresh icon to force an immediate update. If manual refresh doesn't work after 2-3 attempts, contact support."

### [03:20-03:50] When to Contact Support (30 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Contact support immediately if you tried all quick fixes and nothing worked, you see error messages mentioning 'API', 'authentication', or 'permissions', data is wildly incorrect, the app is completely inaccessible for more than 10 minutes, or approvals are failing consistently. Reach us at support@hotdash.com. Include screenshots!"

### [03:50-04:00] Closing (10 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Prevention tip: keep your browser updated, maintain a stable internet connection, and log in to HotDash at least once daily. For power user tips, check out our Advanced Features video!"
