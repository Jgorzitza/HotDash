## Training Framework: 5-Question Decision Model

**Core Framework** (Applied to every approval):

1. **Accuracy** ✅ - Is all information correct?
2. **Completeness** ✅ - Are all questions answered?
3. **Tone** ✅ - Is it friendly, professional, empathetic?
4. **Clarity** ✅ - Will the customer understand?
5. **Risk** ⚠️ - Any red flags or special approvals needed?

**Decision Paths:**
- **All checks pass** → Approve (90% of cases)
- **Minor issues** → Edit & Approve (8% of cases)
- **Major issues** → Reject (1-2% of cases)
- **Special handling** → Escalate (5-8% of cases)

## Escalation Matrix

| Issue Type | Escalate To | Response SLA |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| High-value (>$100 refund/credit) | Manager | 4 hours |
| Policy exception | Senior Support | 2 hours |
| Angry customer + threats | Manager | **15 minutes** |
| Technical/system issue | Engineering | 1 hour |
| Need guidance | Senior Support | 2 hours |

**Always Escalate When:**
- High-value issues (>$100)
- Policy exception requests
- Customer threats (legal, social media, BBB)
- Technical or system issues
- B2B/wholesale inquiries
- You're unsure or uncomfortable
