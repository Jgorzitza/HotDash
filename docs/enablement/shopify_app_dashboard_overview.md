## Video Script

### [00:00-00:20] Introduction (20 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Welcome to the HotDash Dashboard tour! Over the next 5 minutes, I'll walk you through all 5 tiles, show you how to interpret the data, and explain what actions to take. This is your operational control center - let's explore it together."

### [00:20-01:20] Tile 1: Sales Pulse (60 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Let's start with Tile 1: Sales Pulse. This gives you real-time revenue and order performance. At the top, you see total revenue for today. Below that, your top-selling SKUs. Here I can see which products are driving your business right now. At the bottom, open fulfillment issues. If you see orders here, they're stuck somewhere in your fulfillment process. When this section is empty with a green checkmark, everything's flowing smoothly - that's what you want to see!"

### [01:20-02:05] Tile 2: CX Escalations (45 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Tile 2: CX Escalations shows customer support conversations that have breached your SLA. Each line shows a customer conversation. That red 'SLA breached' indicator means this needs immediate attention. Click 'Review' to see the full conversation and take action. When this tile is empty, your support team is crushing it - no breached SLAs. That's the goal!"

### [02:05-02:45] Tile 3: Fulfillment Health (40 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Tile 3: Fulfillment Health tracks orders that aren't shipping on schedule. You'll see order numbers, status, and how long they've been stuck. Orders stuck more than 24 hours need investigation. Contact your fulfillment team to find out what's blocking shipment. Empty tile means perfect fulfillment - every order is shipping on time."

### [02:45-03:30] Tile 4: Inventory Heatmap (45 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Tile 4: Inventory Heatmap is your early warning system for stockouts. Each alert shows a product running low. Days of cover is your most important metric. Less than 7 days? Time to reorder. Less than 3 days? That's urgent - expedite the shipment if possible. Pro tip: cross-reference with Sales Pulse. If a top-selling SKU has low inventory, that's a double-priority reorder."

### [03:30-04:15] Tile 5: SEO Content (45 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Tile 5: SEO Content shows your top landing pages and traffic trends. Week-over-week traffic change tells you if you're growing or declining. Pages down more than 20% with an 'attention' flag need investigation. Could be broken links, SEO ranking drop, or a competitor outranking you. No alerts? Your SEO strategy is working."

### [04:15-04:50] Dashboard Best Practices (35 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's how to use HotDash effectively: Every morning at 9 AM, scan all 5 tiles in about 3 minutes. Look for red flags: SLA breaches, fulfillment delays, low inventory, traffic drops. If everything's green, you're done. If something's red, click in for details and take action. Then at 3 PM, do a 2-minute afternoon check. That's it. Five minutes twice a day, and you have complete operational awareness."

### [04:50-05:00] Closing & Next Steps (10 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "You're now a HotDash dashboard expert! For specific workflows like handling approvals, check out our Approval Queue video. Questions? Visit docs.hotdash.com. Happy dashboarding!"
