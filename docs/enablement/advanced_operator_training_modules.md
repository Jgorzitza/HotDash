## MODULE 1: Tile Mastery - Approval Queue Deep Dive

### Duration: 45 minutes

### Section 1.1: Advanced Filtering (10 min)

**Beyond Basic Filters:**

**Confidence-Based Workflows:**
```
STRATEGY: Batch processing by confidence level

Morning Session (High Focus):
1. Filter: Confidence <70% (Low)
   - These need extra attention
   - Handle first when you're fresh
   - 15-20 minutes focused work

Mid-Morning (Rapid Processing):
2. Filter: Confidence 90%+ (High)
   - Quick reviews
   - Batch through efficiently
   - 30-40 approvals in 30 minutes

Afternoon (Mixed):
3. Filter: Confidence 70-89% (Medium)
   - Standard review process
   - Most of your queue
   - Steady pace
```

**Custom Filter Combinations:**
- Confidence <75% + Contains "refund" → High attention needed
- Confidence >90% + Order status queries → Super quick
- Customer name contains VIP list → Priority handling

**Pro Tip:** Save your custom filters for one-click access

---

### Section 1.2: Queue Management Strategies (15 min)

**The Power User's Queue Philosophy:**

**1. Time Blocking Strategy**
```
Block 1 (9:00-9:30 AM): Clear overnight queue
- Start fresh with morning focus
- Handle low-confidence items first
- Target: Clear all <70% confidence

Block 2 (11:00-11:30 AM): Rapid high-confidence batch
- Filter for 90%+ confidence
- Speed through simple approvals
- Target: 30-40 approvals

Block 3 (2:00-2:30 PM): Mixed queue work
- Handle whatever's in queue
- Balanced approach
- Target: Clear remaining items

Block 4 (4:30-5:00 PM): Final sweep
- Clear any last items
- Prepare for next day
- Quick check before EOD
```

**2. The "Two-Pass" Technique**
```
Pass 1: Quick Triage (5 minutes)
- Scan entire queue
- Flag urgent items (threats, high-value)
- Escalate anything time-sensitive
- Mark complex ones for Pass 2

Pass 2: Systematic Processing (25 minutes)
- Work through queue top to bottom
- Handle flagged complex items
- Clear queue completely
```

**3. The "Zero Inbox" Goal**
```
Target: Clear queue 3-4 times per day
- Morning: Start at zero
- Lunch: Clear to zero
- Afternoon: Clear to zero
- EOD: End at zero

Benefits:
- Nothing slips through cracks
- Clear mental state
- Visible progress
- Better work-life balance
```

### Section 1.4: Advanced Approval Techniques (10 min)

**Technique 1: The "Red Flag Scan"**
```
Before reading anything, scan for red flags:

Visual Cues:
- 🔴 Low confidence (<70%) - Extra scrutiny
- ⚠️ Keywords: "lawsuit", "bank", "lawyer", "social", "injured"
- 💰 Dollar amounts >$100
- 😠 ALL CAPS or excessive exclamation marks

If ANY red flags: Slow down, review carefully, consider escalation

If NO red flags: Proceed with standard review
```

**Technique 2: The "3-Second Decision"**
```
For high-confidence, simple approvals:

Second 1: Glance at customer question
Second 2: Verify AI answer matches
Second 3: Check tone + click approve

Only possible with:
- Confidence >90%
- Simple inquiry (order status, policy question)
- No red flags detected

Saves 60-90 seconds per approval!
```

**Technique 3: The "Pattern Recognition"**
```
After 100+ approvals, you'll notice patterns:

Pattern: Customer asks "Where is order?"
→ AI draft always starts with "Order #[X] shipped on [date]"
→ 95%+ confidence
→ Almost always approve (verify order # matches)
→ 30 second review

Pattern: Customer mentions "return"
→ Check days since delivery
→ If >30 days, likely needs escalation
→ If <30 days, verify AI cites correct policy (v2.1)
→ 2 minute review

Build your own pattern library mentally!
```

## MODULE 2: Power User Workflows

### Duration: 60 minutes

### Section 2.1: Multi-Issue Handling (20 min)

**Scenario:** Customer message contains multiple questions

**Example:**
> "I want to return my Night Cream (bought 25 days ago) AND I never received my serum from order #4521. Also, when is the new product line launching?"

**The TRIAGE Method:**

**T - Tag Each Issue**
1. Return request (25 days - within policy)
2. Missing item (order #4521 - needs investigation)
3. Product launch question (future product info)

**R - Rate Complexity**
1. Return: Simple (standard process)
2. Missing item: Medium (need to verify shipment)
3. Product launch: Simple (standard response)

**I - Identify Red Flags**
- Missing item = potential escalation if customer is angry
- Multiple issues = might need manager for coordination

**A - Assess AI Response**
- Did AI address ALL three issues?
- Is each answer accurate?
- Are they in logical order?

**G - Go with Best Approach**
- If AI handled all three well: Approve
- If AI missed one issue: Reject, handle manually
- If any complex/escalation needed: Escalate with notes

**E - Execute Decision**
- Click appropriate button
- Add detailed notes if rejecting/escalating

---

### Section 2.2: Advanced Escalation Judgment (20 min)

**Beyond the Basic Rules:**

**Scenario: The "Gray Area" Escalation**

Customer: "I bought this 32 days ago while traveling internationally. Can I return?"

**Analysis:**
- Outside 30-day policy (should escalate per rules)
- BUT: Only 2 days over
- Travel is legitimate exception reason
- Customer isn't angry or threatening

**Options:**
1. **Strict Approach:** Escalate (outside policy = manager decides)
2. **Judgment Approach:** Approve exception if you're confident
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Escalate with recommendation

**Advanced Operators Choose:** Option 3 (Escalate with recommendation)

**Example Escalation Note:**
```
"Customer 2 days outside 30-day return window (32 days). Reason: International 
travel (legitimate). Customer polite, no anger/threats. Recommendation: Approve 
as exception - close to policy edge, valid reason, good customer relationship.

Order value: $149 (within operator authority if manager approves exception).

Manager: Approve exception or strict policy enforcement?"
```

**Why This is Advanced:**
- Shows judgment and analysis
- Provides recommendation (not just punting decision)
- Includes relevant context
- Manager can quickly approve or override

### Section 2.3: Efficiency Optimization (20 min)

**Your Personal Efficiency Dashboard:**

**Track These Metrics:**
```
Daily Dashboard (keep in notebook):

Date: _______

Approvals Handled: ___
- Approved: ___
- Rejected: ___
- Escalated: ___

Time Spent: ___ min
Average per approval: ___ min

Errors Caught: ___
Escalations appropriate: Yes/No

Personal Best: ___ approvals in 30 min

Notes: ___________
```

**Weekly Optimization Review:**
```
Friday EOD - Review Your Week:

1. Where did I spend most time?
   - Low confidence reviews? → Practice pattern recognition
   - Complex scenarios? → Review advanced modules
   - Technical issues? → Learn troubleshooting

2. What slowed me down?
   - Looking up policies? → Memorize top 5 policies
   - Unclear KB sources? → Flag for improvement
   - Indecision? → Review escalation criteria

3. What can I improve next week?
   - Set specific goal (e.g., "Reduce avg time by 15 seconds")
   - Practice one new technique
   - Track improvement
```

**Efficiency Techniques:**

**Technique 1: Template Mental Models**
```
Build mental templates for common scenarios:

Order Status Template:
- Customer asks: "Where is order?"
- Expected AI response: "Order #X shipped [date] via [carrier]. Tracking: [link]"
- Quick verify: Order # matches, shipped date reasonable
- Decision: Approve (30 seconds)

Return Request Template:
- Customer asks: "Can I return?"
- Check: Days since delivery
- If <30 days: AI should approve, verify policy cited is v2.1
- If >30 days: Should escalate or explain policy
- Decision time: 1-2 minutes
```

**Technique 2: The "5-Approval Sprint"**
```
Challenge yourself:

Set timer for 5 minutes
Goal: Complete 5 approvals (1 minute each average)

Rules:
- Only select high-confidence approvals (>90%)
- Use keyboard shortcuts only
- No distractions
- Track your time

This builds speed for simple approvals, freeing time for complex ones
```

## MODULE 3: Complex Scenario Mastery

### Duration: 90 minutes (self-paced)

### Section 3.1: The Angry Customer (30 min)

**Levels of Anger - Recognition and Response:**

**Level 1: Frustrated**
```
Indicators:
- "This is frustrating"
- Some caps but not all
- Questions why something happened

Response:
- Usually can approve AI draft if it acknowledges frustration
- Verify AI apologized and provided solution
- Tone check: Is empathy present?

Decision: Usually approve (if AI handled well)
```

**Level 2: Angry**
```
Indicators:
- SIGNIFICANT CAPS USAGE
- Multiple exclamation marks!!!
- "This is unacceptable"
- Demanding immediate action

Response:
- Extra careful review
- Verify AI apologized sincerely
- Check if compensation offered (if appropriate)
- Consider if manager should call directly

Decision: Approve if AI response is strong, OR escalate if customer might need personal touch
```

**Level 3: Furious (Always Escalate)**
```
Indicators:
- ENTIRE MESSAGE IN CAPS
- Threats (legal, social media, regulatory)
- Profanity
- "I'm calling my lawyer"

Response:
- Immediate escalation, no exception
- Even if AI response looks perfect
- Manager needs to know about this customer
- Urgent SLA (15 minutes)

Decision: Always escalate
```

**Practice Scenario:**
> "I AM SICK OF THIS! Third time my order was WRONG! You people don't care about customers! Fix this NOW or I'm posting on every social media site about how terrible you are!"

**Analysis:**
- Level 3 fury: All caps, threats (social media)
- Multiple issues: Wrong order (3 times)
- This is escalation territory

**Even if AI response is perfect,** manager needs to handle this personally. Click escalate, note history of issues, mark urgent.

---

### Section 3.2: Policy Edge Cases (30 min)

**The "Almost but Not Quite" Scenarios:**

**Edge Case 1: Time-Based Policies**
```
Policy: 30-day returns

Customer at 29 days: Clear approval
Customer at 31 days: Clear escalation

Customer at 30 days exactly: ???

Decision Framework:
- Count from delivery date, not order date
- If delivered 30 days ago, still within policy (day 0-29 = 30 days)
- Day 31 = outside policy
- When in doubt about date calculation: Escalate with notes
```

**Edge Case 2: Value Thresholds**
```
Policy: Operators approve up to $100, >$100 needs manager

Customer wants refund for $99.50: Clear approval
Customer wants refund for $150: Clear escalation

Customer wants refund for $100.50: ???

Decision Framework:
- Technically over threshold ($100.01+ needs approval)
- But it's close (50 cents over)
- Best practice: Escalate, note "Just over threshold by $0.50"
- Manager will likely approve quickly
- Better safe than sorry on edge cases
```

**Edge Case 3: Multiple Small Issues vs One Big Issue**
```
Customer has 3 issues:
- Issue 1: $40
- Issue 2: $35
- Issue 3: $30
- Total: $105

Each issue alone: Within authority
Combined: Over threshold

Decision Framework:
- If issues are unrelated: Handle separately (within authority)
- If issues are related (same order, same problem): Escalate (combined value)
- Document your reasoning in notes
```

---

### Section 3.3: Technical Issue Handling (30 min)

**When Tech Goes Wrong:**

**Scenario: Order System Discrepancy**
```
Customer: "Where is my order #4521?"
AI says: "Order #4521 shipped yesterday"
BUT when you check Chatwoot: Order shows "Pending" not "Shipped"

What to do:
1. Don't approve (information conflict)
2. Check which system is correct:
   - Is Chatwoot delayed?
   - Did order ship but system not updated?
   - Is AI pulling old data?
3. If unclear: Escalate as "Technical - System Discrepancy"
4. Note: "AI says shipped, system shows pending. Need verification."

Never guess. Escalate technical uncertainties.
```

**Scenario: KB Source Broken**
```
AI cites "Return Policy v2.1" but link returns 404

What to do:
1. Try to find policy manually in KB
2. If you know policy by heart AND are confident: Can approve
3. If you're not 100% sure: Escalate

Note: "KB source link broken for Return Policy v2.1. Could not verify AI cited 
correct version. Customer question: [question]. Escalating for verification."

Report broken KB links in #occ-enablement
```

## MODULE 4: Continuous Improvement Mindset

### Duration: 30 minutes

### Section 4.1: Learning from Rejections

**Your Rejection Log:**
```
Keep a simple log:

Date | Conversation ID | Why Rejected | How AI Could Improve
------|-----------------|--------------|--------------------
10/12 | #4521          | Wrong policy | Use v2.1 not v2.0
10/12 | #4522          | Missing info | Check all order details
10/13 | #4530          | Wrong tone   | More empathy needed
```

**Monthly Review:**
- What patterns do you see?
- Are you rejecting for same reasons repeatedly?
- How can you provide better feedback to help AI learn?
- Share insights with team

---

### Section 4.2: Contributing to System Improvement

**You're Not Just Using the System - You're Improving It:**

**How Operators Improve the Approval Queue:**

**1. Detailed Rejection Notes**
- Bad: "Wrong"
- Good: "AI cited Return Policy v2.0 (14 days) but current is v2.1 (30 days)"
- Your specific notes help engineering fix root causes

**2. Pattern Reporting**
- See the same error 3+ times? Report it
- Example: "AI consistently misspells customer names from Chatwoot"
- Slack #occ-enablement with pattern description

**3. Feature Suggestions**
- "Would be helpful if..."
- "I wish I could..."
- Your workflow insights improve the product

**4. Training Improvements**
- Found something confusing in training?
- Discovered a better way to explain something?
- Share with enablement team

**Your Feedback Loop:**
```
You reject with notes → AI learns
You report patterns → Engineering fixes
You suggest features → Product improves
You share techniques → Team gets better

Everyone wins!
```
