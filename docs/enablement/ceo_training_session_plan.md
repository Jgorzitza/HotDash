## Session Agenda

### Part 1: Welcome & Vision (3 minutes)

**Script:**

"Welcome! In the next 30 minutes, I'm going to show you how HotDash transforms your daily operations from reactive firefighting to proactive control.

**Your Current Reality:**
- 10-12 hours per week juggling 5 different tools
- Context switching between Shopify, email, spreadsheets, GA
- Missing critical issues until they become urgent
- No single view of what needs attention NOW

**Your New Reality with HotDash:**
- One dashboard, 5 tiles, 3-minute morning check
- AI highlights what needs attention
- Proactive alerts before issues escalate
- <2 hours per week on operations

Let's make this real. I'm going to show you the dashboard, then we'll practice your morning routine together."

### Part 2: Dashboard Overview (8 minutes)

**Demo: Navigate to HotDash App**

**Show Each Tile (90 seconds each):**

**Tile 1: Sales Pulse**
```
"Here's your real-time revenue. Top-selling SKUs are here - this shows what's
Human: continue
driving your business right now. Below that: open fulfillment issues. When this 
is empty with a green checkmark, everything's shipping smoothly.

[Point to each element on screen]

Quick question: Which SKU is your top seller today?"

**Tile 2: CX Escalations**
```
"Customer support conversations that breached your SLA. Each red indicator is 
a customer waiting too long. Click 'Review' to see the full conversation and 
take action. Empty tile means your support team is crushing it.

Current state: [Show current escalations or 'All clear']"

**Tile 3: Fulfillment Health**
```
"Orders not shipping on schedule. See order numbers, status, and how long stuck. 
Anything over 24 hours needs investigation. Empty tile means perfect fulfillment.

What you do: Contact your fulfillment team with specific order numbers."

**Tile 4: Inventory Heatmap**
```
"Your early warning system for stockouts. Days of cover is critical. Less than 
7 days? Time to reorder. Less than 3 days? Urgent - expedite if possible.

Pro tip: Cross-reference with Sales Pulse. Top-selling SKU with low inventory = 
double-priority reorder."

**Tile 5: SEO Content**
```
"Top landing pages and traffic trends. Week-over-week shows if you're growing 
or declining. Pages down >20% with 'attention' flag need investigation - could 
be broken links, SEO ranking drop, or competitor outranking you.

No alerts? Your SEO strategy is working."

### Part 3: CEO Morning Routine (10 minutes)

**Say:** "Now let's practice your actual morning routine. I'm going to walk you through exactly what you'll do every morning at 9 AM. This takes 3 minutes."

**CEO Hands-On Practice:**

**Step 1: Scan All Tiles (60 seconds)**
```
"Open HotDash. Scan left to right, top to bottom. Look for:
- Red indicators (urgent)
- Orange badges (high priority)
- Numbers that look unusual
- Empty tiles with green checks (all good)

Let's do it together now. [Walk through each tile]

What did you notice first? [Listen to CEO response]"
```

**Step 2: Prioritize Actions (60 seconds)**
```
"When you see red flags, here's your priority order:
1. CX Escalations (customers waiting)
2. Fulfillment delays (orders stuck)
3. Inventory below 3 days (stockout risk)
4. Sales anomalies (sudden drops)
5. SEO issues (traffic declines)

Let's say you have 2 escalations, 1 stuck order, and low inventory on a 
top SKU. What would you tackle first? [Guide CEO through decision]"
```

**Step 3: Take Action (60 seconds)**
```
"Click into any tile for details. From there:
- CX Escalations: Click 'Review', read conversation, respond or delegate
- Fulfillment: Contact warehouse with order numbers
- Inventory: Place reorder or expedite shipment
- SEO: Investigate page, check rankings, fix issues

Try it now: Click into [choose a tile]. [CEO practices navigation]"
```

### Part 4: Decision Scenarios (6 minutes)

**Say:** "Let's practice 3 real scenarios you'll face. Tell me what you'd do."

**Scenario A: Sales Drop**
```
"Sales Pulse shows revenue down 30% from yesterday. No obvious issues in 
other tiles. What do you investigate?"

**Expert Answer**: 
1. Check order volume vs. average order value
2. Look at top SKU sales trends
3. Check if traffic is down (SEO Content tile)
4. Consider: Day of week, seasonality, marketing campaigns
5. If unexplained after 10 min, escalate to team
```

**Scenario B: Multiple Escalations**
```
"CX Escalations shows 5 breached SLAs, all about the same issue: 'Order 
tracking not updating.' What do you do?"

**Expert Answer**:
1. This is a systemic issue, not isolated
2. Click into one conversation to understand details
3. Contact fulfillment/shipping partner immediately
4. Draft holding response: 'We're aware of tracking delays, investigating'
5. Monitor until resolved
```

**Scenario C: Low Inventory on Top SKU**
```
"Inventory shows your #1 selling SKU has 2 days of cover. Supplier lead 
time is 7 days. What do you do?"

**Expert Answer**:
1. URGENT - This is a stockout risk
2. Contact supplier immediately to expedite
3. Consider: Can you source from alternate supplier?
4. Update product page if stockout likely (coming soon, pre-order)
5. Monitor daily until shipment arrives
```

### Part 5: When to Get Help (2 minutes)

**Say:** "You won't have all the answers. Here's when to ask for help."

**Always Escalate:**
- Technical errors you can't resolve in 5 minutes
- Customer issues >$500 value
- Legal threats, regulatory complaints, health/safety
- Data that looks completely wrong
- Anything you're unsure about

**Who to Contact:**
- Technical issues: [Engineer/IT contact]
- Customer escalations: [Support Manager]
- Fulfillment: [Warehouse Manager]
- Inventory: [Procurement contact]
- SEO/Marketing: [Marketing contact]

**Best Practice:** "When in doubt, ask. 2-minute question now prevents 2-hour crisis later."

---

### Part 6: Wrap-Up & Next Steps (1 minute)

**Say:** "That's it! Let's recap:"

**Your Daily Routine:**
1. 9 AM: 3-minute dashboard scan
2. 3 PM: 2-minute afternoon check
3. React to red flags immediately
4. Ask for help when unsure

**What You Have:**
- Quick Start Guide (keep at your desk)
- Quick Reference Card (laminate this)
- My contact info for questions
- This dashboard open in your browser 24/7

**First Week Plan:**
- Day 1-2: I'm available for questions

## Troubleshooting Guide (For Facilitator)

**If CEO says "This is too complicated":**
→ Focus on ONE tile only for Week 1. Build confidence incrementally.

**If CEO struggles with navigation:**
→ Slow down. Do hands-on practice for 10 extra minutes.

**If CEO questions ROI:**
→ Calculate time saved: "10-12 hours down to <2 hours = 8-10 hours/week saved. At CEO hourly value, that's [calculate] per year."

**If CEO wants to delegate:**
→ That's fine! HotDash works for operators too. Adjust training focus.

**If technical issues arise:**
→ Have Engineer contact info ready. Don't let technical issues derail training.
