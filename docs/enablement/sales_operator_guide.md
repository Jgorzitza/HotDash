   - Potential churn risks
   - Upsell opportunities (customer reaching out)

   - Delayed orders = unhappy customers
   - Follow up before they complain
   - Prevent refunds/chargebacks

**Top-Selling SKUs:**
- Who's buying these? (check customer profiles)
- Cross-sell opportunities (what pairs with these?)
- Inventory status (can we fulfill demand?)

**Fulfillment Issues:**

- Proactive resolution = save the sale

### Revenue Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: High-Value Customer Focus**
```
Identify: Orders >$500
Action: Personal outreach
- "Thank you for your order!"
- "Need help with installation?"
- "Here's 10% off your next order"
Result: Increase repeat purchase rate
```

**Strategy 2: Cart Abandonment Recovery**
```
Identify: Customers who started checkout but didn't complete
Action: Follow-up email/call
- "I noticed you left items in cart"
- "Can I answer any questions?"
- "Free shipping if you complete today"
Result: Recover 20-30% of abandoned carts
```

**Strategy 3: Cross-Sell/Upsell**
```
Identify: Customer bought Product A
Action: Suggest Product B (complementary)
- "Customers who bought X also bought Y"
- "You'll need Z to install X"
- "Upgrade to premium version for $50 more"
Result: Increase average order value 15-25%
```

## Inventory-Driven Sales

### Using Inventory Heatmap for Sales

**Low Stock Alert = Sales Urgency**

**When top seller <7 days cover:**
1. Create urgency: "Limited stock - order now"
2. Update product page: "Only X left in stock"
3. Email previous buyers: "Restocking fee going up"
4. Social media: "Last chance before price increase"

**Example:**
```
"Holley 750 CFM Carburetor - only 8 left in stock!

Our most popular carburetor is running low. With our supplier lead 
time, next batch won't arrive for 7-10 days and may have a price 
increase. Order now to lock in current price and guarantee availability.

[Order Now - $449.99]"

Result: Sell out remaining stock at current margin, generate urgency
```

### Pre-Sell for Out-of-Stock Items

**When inventory = 0:**
- Don't lose the sale!
- Offer pre-order with discount
- Set clear expectations

**Example:**
```
"Out of Stock - Pre-Order Now (Save 10%)

This item is temporarily out of stock. Pre-order now for:
- 10% discount ($449 → $404)
- Ships in 7-10 days
- Price guarantee (won't increase)

[Pre-Order Now]"

Result: Capture sales even when out of stock, generate cash flow
```

---

## Proactive Sales Support

### Fulfillment Delays = Sales Opportunity

**When orders delayed:**
1. Contact customer BEFORE they complain
2. Offer: Free expedited shipping on next order
3. Offer: 10% discount on future purchase
4. Result: Turn negative into positive, increase loyalty

**Example:**
```
"Hi [Name], I see your order #[number] is delayed by 1-2 days due to 
high volume. I'm very sorry about this!

As an apology, I'd like to offer you:
- Free expedited shipping on this order (if still time)
- 10% off your next purchase (code: SORRY10)

Your satisfaction matters to us. Let me know if there's anything else 
I can do!

- [Your Name], Sales Team"

Result: Customer feels valued, likely to return
```

### CX Escalations = Upsell Opportunities

**High-value customer with issue:**
1. Resolve issue exceptionally well
2. Build relationship
3. Suggest complementary products
4. Result: Increase customer lifetime value

**Example:**
```
Customer: "Where is my order?"
You: [Resolve with tracking + apology]

Then: "By the way, I noticed you ordered the Holley carburetor. 
You might need a fuel pressure regulator to pair with it. We have 
a great one on sale this week: [link]"

Result: Solve problem + generate additional sale
```
