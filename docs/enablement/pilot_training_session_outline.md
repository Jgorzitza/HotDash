## Session Agenda

### Part 1: Welcome & Context (5 minutes)

**Script:**

"Hi everyone! Thanks for being part of the Agent SDK pilot. This is exciting - you're the first operators to use this new approval queue system.

**Today's Goal:** Get you comfortable enough to start reviewing AI-prepared customer responses.

**What We'll Cover in 30 Minutes:**
1. Quick overview of what this is (5 min)
2. Live demo - see it in action (10 min)
3. Your top questions answered (10 min)
4. Quick hands-on look (5 min)

**Ground Rules:**
- This is a pilot - we're learning together
- Ask questions anytime
- No such thing as a dumb question
- Your feedback will improve the system

**Key Point:** You're always in control. AI suggests, you decide. Let's dive in!"

### Part 2: Live Demonstration (10 minutes)

**Demo 1: Standard Approval** (3 min)

**Say:** "Let me show you the most common scenario - a simple approval."

**Show:**
1. Navigate to approval queue: `/app/approvals`
2. Point out: Pending count, queue stats
3. Open first approval card
4. **Walk through on screen:**
   - "Here's the customer's message: 'Where is my order #12345?'"
   - "Here's what the AI prepared: 'Hi! Your order #12345 shipped yesterday...'"
   - "Quick check: Accurate? Yes. Answers question? Yes. Tone okay? Yes."
   - "Click 'Approve & Execute'"
   - "Done! Response sent to customer. That took 30 seconds."

**Say:** "90% of approvals will be this simple."

---

**Demo 2: When to Reject** (3 min)

**Say:** "Now let me show you when to reject."

**Show:**
1. Open another approval
2. **Walk through:**
   - "Customer asks: 'Can I return after 20 days?'"
   - "AI says: 'Policy is 14 days, sorry no returns'"
   - "PROBLEM: Our policy is actually 30 days - AI is wrong!"
   - "Click 'Reject'"
   - "Add note: 'AI cited wrong policy - actual policy is 30 days'"
   - "Now I'll handle this manually in Chatwoot with correct info"

**Say:** "You're the quality check. When AI is wrong, reject it and handle manually."

---

**Demo 3: When to Escalate** (4 min)

**Say:** "This is the most important one - when to escalate."

**Show:**
1. Open approval with red flags
2. **Walk through:**
   - "Customer message: 'You charged me twice! $600! I'm calling my bank!'"
   - "RED FLAGS I see:"
     - "High value: $600"
     - "Threat: Calling bank = chargeback threat"
   - "Click 'Escalate'"
   - "Select reason: 'High-Value Issue + Threat'"
   - "Add quick notes about customer and issue"
   - "Submit - my manager gets notified in 15 minutes"

**Say:** "Always escalate: >$100, threats, technical issues, or if you're unsure. Better safe than sorry."

---

### Part 3: Top 5 FAQ (10 minutes)

**Say:** "Let me answer the top 5 questions we expect you'll have."

**Q1: What if I approve something wrong?**
"Catch it in next few minutes, send correction in Chatwoot. Document it. This is a pilot - we expect some mistakes. No penalty."

**Q2: How do I know if AI is accurate?**
"Check 'KB Sources' listed in the approval. Click to verify if you're unsure. If confidence score is <70%, review extra carefully. Trust but verify."

**Q3: When exactly should I escalate?**
"Always escalate: Refunds >$100, any threats (legal, social media), technical errors, you're unsure. When in doubt, escalate."

**Q4: How many approvals will I see?**
"During pilot: 5-15 per day. Won't overwhelm you. This is gradual introduction."

**Q5: Can I still work in Chatwoot normally?**
"Yes! Approval queue is optional assistance. Use it when helpful, skip it when not. You're not forced to use it for everything."

### Part 4: Hands-On Interface Tour (5 minutes)

**Say:** "Let's look at the actual interface together."

**Show:**
- Queue overview screen
- How to filter/search
- Where to find help
- Settings (if applicable)

**Invite:** "Any questions about what you see?"

**Wrap-Up:**
"That's it! You're ready to start. Remember:
1. You're in control
2. Escalate when unsure
3. Ask questions anytime
4. Give us feedback - we want to know what works and what doesn't

Here's your Quick Start Guide (hand out). Keep it at your desk.

Questions before we finish?"
