## üîß Essential Automotive Knowledge

### Engine Basics (What Operators Must Know)

**Engine Types**:

**Small Block Chevy** (SBC):
- 265, 283, 305, 327, 350, 383, 400 cubic inches
- Most common hot rod engine
- Affordable, plentiful, reliable
- 250-450 HP (typical)

**Big Block Chevy** (BBC):
- 396, 402, 427, 454, 502 cubic inches
- More power, heavier, thirstier
- Classic muscle car engine
- 400-600+ HP (typical)

**LS Engines** (Modern Chevy V8):
- LS1, LS2, LS3, LS6, LS7, LS9, LSX
- 1997-present technology
- Aluminum, lightweight, efficient
- 350-700+ HP (depending on model)
- **Most popular swap** (fits everything, reliable)

**Ford Engines**:
- Small Block Ford: 260, 289, 302, 351W
- Big Block Ford: 390, 427, 428, 429, 460
- Coyote (modern): 5.0L V8, 400+ HP

**Why This Matters**: Horsepower determines fuel system sizing. Different engines need different AN fitting sizes.

---

### Fuel System Components

**Understanding the Full System** (Tank to Engine):

**1. Fuel Tank**:
- Holds fuel (gas, E85, racing fuel)
- May have internal pump or external
- Vent system prevents vapor lock

**2. Fuel Pump**:
- **Mechanical**: Driven by engine camshaft, 250-300 HP max
- **Electric**: External pump, 300-1500+ HP capable
- Common brands: Aeromotive, Holley, Walbro

**3. Fuel Lines**:
- **Feed line**: Tank to engine (carries fuel forward)
- **Return line**: Engine to tank (returns excess fuel)
- Size based on HP (see sizing guide)

**4. Fuel Filter**:
- Removes debris from fuel
- Must be high-flow (100+ GPH for performance)
- Install AFTER pump (not before)

**5. Fuel Pressure Regulator**:
- Controls pressure to carburetor/EFI
- Adjustable (dial in exact pressure)
- Carbs need 5-7 PSI, EFI needs 43-58 PSI

**6. Carburetor or EFI**:
- **Carburetor**: Mechanical fuel metering, 5-7 PSI
- **EFI**: Electronic injectors, 43-58 PSI
- Different requirements!

**Why This Matters**: Customers ask about complete systems, not just one fitting. Understand how parts work together.

---

## üèÅ Hot Rod Racing Basics

### Types of Racing (What Your Customers Do)

**Drag Racing** (Straight-line acceleration):
- **1/4 Mile**: Traditional distance (12-20 seconds)
- **1/8 Mile**: Shorter tracks (6-12 seconds)
- **Classes**: Street, bracket, pro mod, etc.
- **Urgency**: Race every weekend (parts needed ASAP!)

**Road Racing** (Corners and straights):
- **Road courses**: Paved tracks with turns
- **Autocross**: Parking lot courses, slower speeds
- **Track days**: Practice, not competition
- **Fuel needs**: Sustained high RPM, need reliability

**Circle Track** (Oval racing):
- **Dirt track**: Local short tracks
- **Paved oval**: Higher speeds
- **Fuel challenges**: Long runs, consistent flow needed

**Car Shows** (Display and judging):
- **Goodguys**: National hot rod shows
- **NSRA**: Street rod nationals
- **Local shows**: Cruise nights, local events
- **Focus**: Appearance + performance

**Why This Matters**: Racing = urgency. Shows = aesthetics. Different needs, different support approaches.

---

### Race Weekend Psychology

**Why "Race Weekend" Is Critical**:

**Financial Investment**:
- Race entry: $50-$500
- Fuel/tires: $100-$300
- Towing (if trailered): $100-$300
- Hotel: $150-$300
- Food/expenses: $100-$200
- **Total**: $500-$1,500 weekend

**Emotional Investment**:
- Months of preparation
- Trophy/championship points at stake
- Bragging rights with friends
- Social event (family, friends attend)

**What It Means For Support**:
- ‚ö° Urgency is REAL (not exaggerated)
- üí∞ Customer has financial stake
- üèÜ Performance matters (no room for part failure)
- ‚è∞ Hard deadline (can't postpone Saturday race)

**How to Respond**:
```
‚ùå "We'll try our best"
‚úÖ "I can get this overnight to you by Friday 10:30am for your Saturday race"

‚ùå "Calm down, it's just a race"
‚úÖ "I totally understand‚Äîrace weekends wait for no one! Let's get you sorted."

‚ùå "Maybe it'll arrive in time"
‚úÖ "With overnight ordered by 3pm today, you'll have it Friday morning, guaranteed."
```

## üõ†Ô∏è AN Fitting Industry Explained

### History of AN Fittings

**AN = Army-Navy** (military specification):
- Developed in WWII for aircraft fuel systems
- Designed for: No leaks, high vibration, reliable
- Standardized sizing (AN-4, AN-6, AN-8, etc.)
- Adopted by racing, then hot rods

**Why Hot Rodders Use AN Fittings**:
- ‚úÖ Reliable (no leaks when installed correctly)
- ‚úÖ Reusable (can disassemble/reassemble)
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance (polished aluminum, anodized colors)
- ‚úÖ Performance (handles high pressure, vibration)
- ‚úÖ Standardized (any AN-6 fits any AN-6)

**vs Old-School Rubber Hose + Clamps**:
- Rubber degrades with ethanol fuel
- Hose clamps loosen over time
- Leaks are common
- Looks amateur

**Hot Rod Culture**: AN fittings signal "serious build" vs "backyard repair"

---

### AN Fitting Anatomy

**Components of an AN Fitting**:

**1. Male Fitting (Nipple)**:
- Has 37¬∞ flare cone (sealing surface)
- External threads (screw into female)
- Wrench flats (for tightening)

**2. Female Fitting (Nut)**:
- Internal threads (receives male)
- Captures flare with internal cone
- Swivel or non-swivel

**3. Adapter**:
- Converts one thread type to another
- Example: AN-6 male to 1/4" NPT female
- Allows AN fittings to connect to carburetors, pumps

**Sealing Mechanism**:
- 37¬∞ flare on male fits into 37¬∞ cone in female
- Metal-to-metal seal (no gasket, no sealant!)
- Seals when tightened to proper torque

**Why This Matters**: Understanding anatomy helps diagnose leaks and explain installations.

---

## üéØ Industry-Specific Support Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time AN Fitting Buyer

**Customer**: Beginner, never used AN fittings before

**Common Questions**:
- "Why do I need AN fittings instead of regular hose?"
- "Are AN fittings reusable?"
- "Do I need special tools?"
- "How tight should I make them?"

**Your Approach**:
```
1. Educate (don't assume knowledge):
   "AN fittings are military-spec fittings that seal with a 37¬∞ 
    flare. They're way more reliable than rubber hose + clamps."

2. Set expectations:
   "They're reusable, but you need two wrenches to tighten properly.
    Here's a video guide: [link]"

3. Provide complete list:
   "For your fuel system, you'll need:
    ‚Ä¢ Hose ends (attach to braided line)
    ‚Ä¢ Adapters (connect to carburetor/pump)
    ‚Ä¢ Tools: Two AN wrenches"

4. Offer help:
   "I can help you build a complete kit for your project.
    What engine are you working with?"
```

---

### Scenario 2: LS Swap Builder

**Customer**: Intermediate to advanced, doing popular engine swap

**Context**: LS swaps are THE most common hot rod engine swap
- Chevy LS engines (1997-present) fit almost any vehicle
- Affordable (junkyards, used market)
- Reliable (millions produced)
- Powerful (350-700 HP)

**Common LS Swap Fuel System Questions**:
- "I'm LS-swapping my [vehicle], what fuel system?"
- "Can I keep my mechanical pump with an LS?"
- "What fuel line size for 450 HP LS3?"
- "Do I need a return-style or returnless system?"

**Your Approach**:
```
1. Acknowledge project:
   "LS swaps are awesome! What gen LS are you using?"

2. Key question: Carb or EFI?
   "Are you running a carburetor or keeping it EFI?"
   ‚Ä¢ Carb: 5-7 PSI, simpler fuel system
   ‚Ä¢ EFI: 58 PSI, requires high-pressure pump

3. Recommend system:
   "For 450 HP LS3 with EFI, you'll need:
    ‚Ä¢ AN-8 feed line (1/2")
    ‚Ä¢ AN-6 return line (3/8")
    ‚Ä¢ High-pressure electric pump (140 GPH, 58 PSI)
    ‚Ä¢ EFI-rated fuel pressure regulator"

4. Suggest kit:
   "We have complete LS swap fuel system kits. Saves you time
    figuring out all the parts. Want details?"
```

---

### Scenario 3: Race Season Rush Orders

**Context**: Racing season is March-October (spring/summer)
- Peak: April-September
- Winter: Off-season (builds and prep)

**Race Weekend Pattern**:
- Monday-Wednesday: Customers order (standard shipping fine)
- Thursday: Requests start for rush shipping
- **Friday**: Panic orders! ("Race tomorrow, need overnight!")

**Your Approach for Rush Orders**:
```
1. Assess urgency:
   "What day is your race?" (Confirms deadline)

2. Check timeline:
   Today: Thursday 2pm
   Race: Saturday
   Overnight: Will arrive Friday (‚úÖ Makes it!)

3. Verify stock:
   "Let me check inventory... Yes, in stock!"

4. Set expectations:
   "To get this by Friday, I need to process overnight shipping
    by 3pm today (that's 1 hour from now). Total cost: $[amount]
    including $[shipping]. Should I process it?"

5. Act fast:
   ‚Ä¢ Process order immediately
   ‚Ä¢ Alert warehouse: RUSH ORDER
   ‚Ä¢ Send tracking within 2 hours
   ‚Ä¢ Follow up after race: "How'd it go?"
```

### Scenario 4: Fuel Leak Troubleshooting

**Context**: #1 technical support issue for AN fittings

**Customer Psychology**:
- Frustrated (spent time/money, still leaks)
- May have damaged parts (over-tightening)
- Might blame product (but usually installation)
- Needs patient, systematic diagnosis

**Your Approach**:
```
1. Empathize first:
   "I know fuel leaks are frustrating. Let's figure this out together."

2. Don't blame customer:
   ‚ùå "You probably installed it wrong"
   ‚úÖ "Let's check a few common causes"

3. Systematic diagnosis (5-step framework):
   IDENTIFY: "Where exactly is it leaking?"
   ISOLATE: "Is it at the flare connection or hose end?"
   DIAGNOSE: "Let me walk you through checking the flare..."
   RESOLVE: "Here's how to fix it..."
   VERIFY: "Tighten it, then check for leaks with fuel pressure on"

4. Educate (prevent future issues):
   "AN fittings seal at the 37¬∞ flare, not with thread pressure.
    Snug + 1/8 turn is all you need. Over-tightening actually
    causes leaks!"

5. Offer replacement if needed:
   "If the flare is damaged, we'll send a replacement. I'll include
    a torque spec guide so this doesn't happen again."
```

- "Will this fit my Holley carburetor?"
- "What adapter for my Aeromotive pump?"
- "Is this compatible with my car?"

**How to Help**:
```
Ask for specifics:

"What brand and model carburetor do you have?"
Customer: "Holley 750 CFM"

Look up specs or use playbook:
"Holley 750 has two 1/2"-20 inlet fittings. You need:
‚Ä¢ AN-6 male to 1/2"-20 female adapters (qty 2)
‚Ä¢ These adapt your AN-6 fuel line to the Holley inlets"

Provide exact part numbers when possible.
```

---

### Pain Point 3: Installation Anxiety

**Problem**: Afraid of doing it wrong
- "I've never installed AN fittings before"
- "What if I mess it up?"
- "How tight should I make it?"

**How to Help**:
```
Provide confidence:

"AN fittings are straightforward! Here's the process:

1. Thread on by hand until snug
2. Use two wrenches (one on each side)
3. Tighten 1/8 to 1/4 turn past snug
4. That's it! Don't over-tighten.

Thousands of first-timers install these successfully. 
I'll send you our installation guide with photos.

And if you have any questions during install, just email or 
call‚Äîwe're here to help!"

Remove fear, build confidence.
