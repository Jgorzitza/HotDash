## Video Script

### [00:00-00:15] Hook & Introduction (15 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Hi! I'm going to show you how to get HotDash up and running in your Shopify store in just 2 minutes. By the end of this video, you'll be looking at your first operational dashboard. Let's dive in!"

### [00:15-00:45] Installation (30 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "First, head to your Shopify admin and click 'Apps' in the left sidebar. Search for 'HotDash' in the Shopify App Store. Click on HotDash, then hit 'Install App'. Review the permissions - HotDash needs access to your orders, products, and customer data to build your dashboard. Click 'Install' to continue. The app is now installing - this takes about 5 to 10 seconds."

### [00:45-01:15] First Setup (30 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Great! You'll see a quick welcome screen. HotDash is now pulling your store data to build your first dashboard. Behind the scenes, HotDash is connecting to your Shopify store, analyzing your sales, orders, inventory, and customer support data. This initial sync takes 15 to 30 seconds. While it's working, I'll mention - HotDash gives you 5 real-time tiles covering sales, customer experience, fulfillment, inventory, and SEO. And... we're done! Your dashboard is ready."

### [01:15-01:50] First Dashboard View (35 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's your HotDash dashboard. Let me quickly show you what you're looking at. Tile 1: Sales Pulse - your revenue, order count, and top products. Tile 2: CX Escalations - customer support issues needing attention. Tile 3: Fulfillment Health - orders stuck in fulfillment. Tile 4: Inventory Heatmap - low stock alerts with days of cover. Tile 5: SEO Content - traffic trends and pages needing attention. All five tiles update automatically throughout the day, so you always see current data."

### [01:50-02:00] Closing & Next Steps (10 seconds)

**Voiceover:**
> "That's it! You're now set up. Check your dashboard twice a day - morning and afternoon - to stay on top of your operations. For detailed training on each tile, check out our Dashboard Overview video. Welcome to HotDash!"
