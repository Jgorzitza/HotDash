### Common Support Scenarios

**Scenario 1: "Where is my order?"**
```
Response Template:
"Hi [Name], thanks for reaching out! I've checked your order #[number]. 
It shipped on [date] via [carrier]. Your tracking number is [number]. 
Current status shows [status]. You should receive it by [date]. 
Let me know if you have any other questions!"

Time: 2 minutes
```

**Scenario 2: "I want to return this"**
```
Check: Is it within 30-day return window?

If YES:
"Hi [Name], I can definitely help with that return. Our return policy 
allows returns within 30 days. Here's what to do:
1. Print the return label: [link]
2. Pack the item securely
3. Drop off at [carrier]
4. Refund processes within 5-7 business days after we receive it.
Questions? Let me know!"

If NO (>30 days):
Escalate to manager - out of policy exception required

Time: 3-5 minutes
```

**Scenario 3: "This part doesn't fit my car"**
```
Technical issue - requires expertise

Response:
"Hi [Name], I'm sorry the part doesn't fit. Let me help you figure this out.
Can you confirm:
- Your vehicle: Year, Make, Model
- Which part you ordered: [SKU]
- What doesn't fit specifically?

I'll verify fitment and either send the correct part or process a return.
Give me those details and I'll get you sorted!"

Then: Check fitment guide or escalate to technical specialist

Time: 3-5 minutes
```

**Scenario 4: "I was charged twice!"**
```
High-value issue - ESCALATE

Don't promise resolution yourself. Escalate to manager immediately.

Holding response:
"Hi [Name], I see the duplicate charge - I'm so sorry about this. 
I've escalated this to our billing team who will investigate and 
resolve within 2 hours. You'll hear from us by [time]. This is our 
top priority."

Manager handles actual resolution.

Time: 1 minute (quick escalation)
```

- Fix: Always provide timeline: "within 24 hours", "by Friday"

**Mistake 4: Escalating Too Much**
- Fix: Only escalate high-value, out-of-policy, or uncertain issues
