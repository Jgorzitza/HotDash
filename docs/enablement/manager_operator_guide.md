## Strategic Dashboard Use

### Revenue Management (Sales Pulse)

**Daily Revenue Analysis:**
```
Question: Why is revenue up/down?
- Volume change (more/fewer orders)?
- AOV change (higher/lower order values)?
- Traffic change (SEO Content correlation)?
- Seasonal pattern?

Action Decision Tree:
- Revenue down + volume down → Marketing problem
- Revenue down + AOV down → Upsell problem
- Revenue up + inventory low → Procurement urgency
- Revenue up + fulfillment delays → Warehouse capacity issue
```

**Strategic Interventions:**
- **Revenue spike:** Ensure inventory can support demand
- **Revenue drop:** Investigate root cause, coordinate cross-functional response
- **Top seller change:** Shift marketing focus, adjust inventory
- **Fulfillment issues:** Directly impact sales, prioritize resolution

---

### Team Workload Management (CX Escalations)

**Escalation Volume Analysis:**
```
Normal: 10-20 escalations/day (manageable)
High: 30-50 escalations/day (need more support resources)
Critical: >50 escalations/day (systemic issue, all-hands)

Action Based on Volume:
- Normal → Business as usual
- High → Redistribute work, bring in backup
- Critical → Root cause analysis, emergency response
```

**Escalation Pattern Recognition:**
```
Same Issue Appears 3+ Times = Systemic Problem

Examples:
- Multiple "where's my tracking?" → Shipping partner issue
- Multiple "wrong part" → Product data issue
- Multiple "site error" → Technical issue

Manager Action:
1. Identify root cause
2. Coordinate fix with responsible team
3. Draft holding response for all affected customers
4. Monitor until resolved
```

**Handling High-Value Escalations:**
- Refunds >$100 → Manager approval required
- Legal/regulatory threats → Handle personally, document
- VIP customers → White-glove treatment
- Repeat escalations → Personal intervention

---

### Operational Risk Management (Fulfillment Health)

**Delayed Orders - Impact Analysis:**
```
1-5 delayed orders → Normal operations, monitor
5-15 delayed orders → Warehouse capacity issue, investigate
>15 delayed orders → Critical, immediate warehouse contact

Manager Actions:
1. Contact warehouse manager (get ETA)
2. Determine if proactive customer outreach needed
3. Coordinate resolution plan
4. Allocate team to customer communications
5. Monitor daily until resolved
```

**Proactive Customer Management:**
- Orders delayed >24 hours → Proactive outreach
- Orders delayed >48 hours → Expedite + compensation
- Orders delayed >72 hours → Full refund offer + expedite

---

### Strategic Inventory Planning (Inventory Heatmap)

**Stockout Risk Assessment:**
```
Top Seller + <3 days cover = P0 URGENT
Top Seller + 3-7 days cover = P1 Important
Mid Seller + <3 days cover = P2 Monitor
Low Seller + <3 days cover = P3 Routine

Manager Decision Matrix:
P0: Expedite supplier shipment (pay extra fees), prep pre-sell campaign
P1: Contact supplier for standard rush, update product page
P2: Standard reorder, monitor
P3: Reorder on normal schedule
```

**Investment Decisions:**
- High-margin top seller running low → Invest in larger order
- Slow-moving inventory piling up → Discount campaign
- Seasonal trend approaching → Pre-order extra stock
- New product launch → Conservative initial order, monitor closely

---

### Marketing Effectiveness (SEO Content)

**Traffic Analysis:**
```
Traffic up + Sales up = Marketing working, scale it
Traffic up + Sales flat = Conversion problem, optimize funnel
Traffic flat + Sales up = Great conversion, need more traffic
Traffic down + Sales down = Marketing problem, urgent attention

Manager Actions:
- Traffic drop >20% → Emergency marketing review
- Page-specific drops → Content audit, SEO check
- Trend analysis → Seasonal planning, budget allocation
```

## Escalation Handling Playbook

```
1. Acknowledge immediately: "I've received your message and am reviewing"
2. Don't admit fault or make promises
3. Consult legal if needed (major threats)
4. Resolve generously if possible
5. Document everything
```

**High-Value Issues (>$500):**
```
1. Personal response from you (manager level)
2. Investigate thoroughly
3. Generous resolution (protect customer relationship)
4. Follow-up: "Is this resolved to your satisfaction?"
5. Add to VIP program if not already
```

**Regulatory Threats (BBB, FTC, etc.):**
```
1. Take seriously, respond quickly
2. Document all communications
3. Resolve completely (don't give them ammunition)
4. Alert compliance team if applicable
5. Follow up to confirm resolution
```

### Internal Escalations

**From Support Team:**
- Out-of-policy returns → Case-by-case approval
- Difficult customers → Manager intervention
- Process questions → Clarify or update process

**From Sales Team:**
- Inventory emergency → Expedite decision
- High-value deal support → Resource allocation
- Competitive pricing → Approval or strategy

**From Warehouse:**
- Fulfillment capacity → Shift priorities or bring in temp help
- Inventory discrepancies → Audit and reconcile
- Supplier delays → Alternative sourcing

---

## Strategic Decision-Making

### Data-Driven Decisions

**Question: Should we discount slow-moving inventory?**
```
Dashboard Analysis:
1. Inventory Heatmap: How much is sitting? How long?
2. Sales Pulse: Is it selling at all? At what margin?
3. SEO Content: Is traffic to that product page low?

Decision Matrix:
- Not selling + High inventory + Low margin → Deep discount (30-50% off)
- Slow selling + Moderate inventory + High margin → Mild discount (10-20% off)
- Seasonal product + Off-season → Hold until season, then promote
- Obsolete product → Clearance (50%+ off), make room for new
```

**Question: Should we hire another support operator?**
```
Dashboard Analysis:
1. CX Escalations: Consistently >30/day? Response times suffering?
2. Sales Pulse: Revenue growing (more customers = more support)?
3. Team metrics: Current team at capacity (40-50 tickets/day each)?

Decision:
- Yes if: Escalations >30/day for 2+ weeks + revenue growing + team at capacity
- No if: Temporary spike, seasonal, or can optimize current team
- Partial: Hire contractor/temp first, convert if sustained
```

**Question: Should we expedite supplier shipment (pay $500 extra)?**
```
Dashboard Analysis:
1. Inventory Heatmap: Top seller, <2 days cover
2. Sales Pulse: Selling 10 units/day, $450 revenue each = $4,500/day
3. Math: Stockout risk = lose $9,000-13,500 (2-3 days out of stock)

Decision:
- Pay $500 to save $9,000+ → YES, obvious
- But also: Consider pre-sell campaign, alternative sourcing, rush fees negotiation
```
