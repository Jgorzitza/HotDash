## CEO Decision Needed

**Question 1**: Do you want agents to build the FULL designed feature set?

- YES → 24-30 hours of additional work (but matches your vision)
- NO → Accept current minimal implementation (ship faster, less features)

**Question 2**: If YES, what's the timeline?

- Option A: Build all P0+P1 features before launch (~10 hours)
- Option B: Ship minimal now, add features post-launch incrementally
- Option C: Delay launch, build complete vision (~30 hours)

**Question 3**: Priority order?

- My recommendation: P0 (Approval Queue) → P1 (Notifications + Personalization) → P2 (Polish)

---

## What I'm Doing NOW

1. ✅ Restored all 57 design files
2. ⏳ Creating updated agent directions with full feature set
3. ⏳ Documenting gap between designed vs. built
4. ⏳ Awaiting your decision on build priority

**Your specs are SAFE** - nothing was truly lost, just archived.
