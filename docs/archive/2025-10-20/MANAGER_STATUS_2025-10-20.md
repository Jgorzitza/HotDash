## 🔧 GIT STATUS

**PR #108**: https://github.com/Jgorzitza/HotDash/pull/108

**Commits** (clean, passed CI):

1. `b59d764` - feat(manager): align directions + verify blockers + Option A launch
2. `2901df2` - security(P0): Fix GitGuardian alert - PostgreSQL URI in git history

**CI Status**:

- ✅ GitGuardian Security Checks: PASS
- ✅ Gitleaks: PASS (no leaks found)
- ✅ check-docs: PASS
- ✅ gitleaks: PASS

**Merge Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual intervention

**Issue**: Branch has uncommitted agent WIP (from before manager run) that conflicts with main. The PR commits themselves are clean, but GitHub won't auto-merge due to branch state.

**Options**:

1. **CEO manually merges PR #108** (recommended - commits are clean)
2. **Manager creates new clean branch** with cherry-picked commits (violates non-destructive rule)
3. **Accept current state** - security fix verified working, agents can proceed
