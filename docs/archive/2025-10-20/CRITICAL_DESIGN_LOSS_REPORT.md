## What Happened

### The Archival Sweep (Oct 15)

**Commit**: 7d25562 - "docs: sweep and archive non-sprint docs"  
**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Action**: Moved **57 design files** to `docs/_archive/2025-10-15-misc/design/`

**Commit Message**:

> "Kept: NORTH_STAR, RULES, OPERATING_MODEL, runbooks/, directions/, specs/, integrations/, manager/, mcp/  
> Archived: marketing, enablement, compliance/evidence, pilot, ops, strategy, testing, **design drafts**, dev notes, etc."

### What Was Lost (ARCHIVED)

**57 Design Files Including**:

1. **HANDOFF-approval-queue-ui.md** - Complete Polaris implementation spec
2. **approval-queue-edge-states.md** - 52KB edge case handling
3. **approvalcard-component-spec.md** - 30KB component spec
4. **dashboard-features-1K-1P.md** - Personalization, notifications, tile reordering
5. **dashboard-onboarding-flow.md** - User onboarding experience
6. **dashboard_wireframes.md** - Complete wireframe mockups
7. **tile-specific-ui-refinement.md** - Detailed tile polish
8. **notification-system-design.md** - Alert/notification system
9. **realtime-update-indicators.md** - Live data indicators
10. **modal-refresh-handoff.md** - Modal component specs
11. **accessibility-approval-flow.md** - A11y specs for approvals
12. **design-system-guide.md** - 38KB design system
13. Plus **44 more** detailed design files

**Total Design Work Archived**: ~500KB+ of specifications

---

## What Was Kept (Only 1 File)

**File**: `docs/design/dashboard-tiles.md`  
**Size**: 15KB  
**Content**: Basic tile inventory and layout patterns  
**Missing**: Advanced features, modals, interactions, personalization

---

## What Got Built vs. What Was Designed

### Designed Features (from archived specs):

**Dashboard**:

- ‚úÖ 8 tiles (6 core + Idea Pool + Approvals Queue)
- ‚ùå Drag & drop tile reordering
- ‚ùå Tile visibility toggles
- ‚ùå User preference storage
- ‚ùå Notification center with badge count
- ‚ùå Real-time update indicators
- ‚ùå Dashboard personalization settings

**Approval Queue**:

- ‚ùå `/approvals` route
- ‚ùå ApprovalCard component (complete spec existed)
- ‚ùå Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- ‚ùå Risk level badges
- ‚ùå Approve/reject actions
- ‚ùå Navigation badge with pending count

**Modals**:

- ‚ùå Enhanced CX Escalation modal with:
  - Conversation preview
  - AI suggested reply
  - Internal notes
  - Grading sliders (tone/accuracy/policy)
  - Multiple action buttons
- ‚ùå Sales Pulse modal with variance review
- ‚ùå Inventory modal with reorder approval

**Advanced Features**:

- ‚ùå Notification system
- ‚ùå Toast messages
- ‚ùå Error retry mechanisms
- ‚ùå Onboarding flow
- ‚ùå Settings page

### Actually Built:

**Dashboard**:

- ‚úÖ 6 basic tiles (missing 2)
- ‚úÖ Simple tile status (ok/error/unconfigured)
- ‚úÖ Basic loading states
- ‚úÖ Basic error states
- ‚úÖ TileCard wrapper component

**Modals**: Minimal implementations (no advanced features)

**Advanced Features**: 0% implemented

## Impact on Today's Work

**Question**: "Did we waste today building towards something completely wrong?"

**Answer**: Unfortunately, partially yes:

- Agents were directed to build based on the BASIC spec (`dashboard-tiles.md`)
- They don't know about the ADVANCED specs (archived as "design drafts")
- Current implementation is ~30% of the designed feature set
- Missing: Approvals queue, notifications, personalization, enhanced modals

---

## Why This Happened

**Manager Decision (Oct 15)**: Archived "design drafts" to clean up docs

**Problem**: Treated comprehensive design specifications as "drafts"

- Should have been in `docs/specs/` not `docs/design/`
- Or flagged as "APPROVED DESIGNS - DO NOT ARCHIVE"
- Archive sweep was too aggressive

**Result**: Agents built to a minimal spec, not the full vision

---

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Restore All Design Files (RECOMMENDED)

**Action**: Move all 57 design files back to `docs/design/`

**Command**:

```bash
cp -r docs/_archive/2025-10-15-misc/design/* docs/design/
git add docs/design/
git commit -m "restore: Recover all 57 design files from Oct 15 archive"
```

**Time**: 5 minutes
**Impact**: Agents can build to full spec

### Option 2: Selective Restore

**Action**: Restore only P0 designs

**Files to Restore**:

1. HANDOFF-approval-queue-ui.md (approval queue spec)
2. dashboard-features-1K-1P.md (personalization)
3. notification-system-design.md (notifications)
4. modal-refresh-handoff.md (enhanced modals)

**Time**: 10 minutes
**Impact**: Core features restored, advanced features remain archived

### Option 3: Start Over with Current Baseline

**Action**: Accept current 6-tile implementation as baseline

**Work Required**:

- Document gap between designed vs. built
- Re-prioritize missing features
- Build incrementally from here

**Time**: Ongoing
**Impact**: Months of additional work

---

## Recommendation

**RESTORE ALL 57 DESIGN FILES IMMEDIATELY**

**Rationale**:

- Your planning day wasn't wasted - the specs exist
- They're complete and detailed
- Just need to be unarchived
- Agents can then build to the full vision
- 5 minutes to restore vs. months to recreate

**Next**:

1. Restore design files (5 min)
2. Update Engineer direction to build full approval queue (60 min)
3. Update Designer direction to implement tile personalization (45 min)
4. Update all agents to build to FULL spec, not minimal spec

---

## My Apology

I made a critical error on Oct 15 by archiving your design work as "drafts". These were approved specifications, not drafts. This caused agents to build to a minimal spec instead of your full vision.

**Fixing now**: Restoring all design files and updating agent directions.
