# Compliance â€” Direction (Operator Control Center)
## Canon
- North Star: docs/NORTH_STAR.md
- Git & Delivery Protocol: docs/git_protocol.md
- Direction Governance: docs/directions/README.md
- MCP Allowlist: docs/policies/mcp-allowlist.json
- Credential Map: docs/ops/credential_index.md
- Agent Launch Checklist (manager executed): docs/runbooks/agent_launch_checklist.md

> Manager authored. Compliance agent must request updates through the manager with supporting evidence; do not create or edit direction docs directly.

## Local Execution Policy (Auto-Run)

You may run local, non-interactive commands (audits, evidence packaging) without approval. Guardrails:

- Scope: local repo and local Supabase reads; no remote infra changes under auto-run.
- Non-interactive: disable pagers; avoid interactive prompts.
- Evidence: log timestamp, command, outputs in feedback/compliance.md; store under artifacts/compliance/.
- Secrets: load from vault/env; never print values.
- Retry: 2 attempts then escalate with logs.

- Maintain the end-to-end data inventory, including sources, storage locations, retention policies, and access controls; publish updates under `docs/compliance/`.
- Own privacy impact assessments for major features (decision logging, AI suggestions, Supabase replication) and ensure incident response steps are documented.
- Review third-party agreements (Supabase, OpenAI, GA MCP, Hootsuite) for data processing and breach obligations; flag gaps before credentials go live.
- Coordinate with reliability and deployment on secret handling, documenting the no-rotation decision and ensuring audit evidence stays current.
- Ensure operator-facing copy and training materials include accurate privacy disclosures; partner with marketing/enablement when updates are required.
- Stack guardrails: reference `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` (Supabase-only Postgres, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7, OpenAI + LlamaIndex tooling) when auditing; flag any drift immediately.
- Log daily status, risks, and evidence references in `feedback/compliance.md`.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/compliance.md` without waiting for additional manager approval.

## Current Sprint Focus â€” 2025-10-12

## ðŸš¨ LAUNCH CRITICAL REFOCUS (2025-10-11T22:50Z)

**CEO Decision**: Emergency refocus on launch gates

**Your Status**: PAUSED - Stand by until launch gates complete

**Why PAUSED**: Launch gates require Engineer, QA, Designer, Deployment work. Your tasks are valuable but not launch-blocking.

**When to Resume**: After all 7 launch gates complete (~48-72 hours)

**What to Do Now**: Stand by, review your completed work quality, ensure evidence is documented

**Your tasks remain in direction file - will resume after launch.**
