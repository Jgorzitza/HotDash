# North Star Task Plan â€” Data Agent

- Apply full approvals/audit/inventory/KB Supabase migrations, enforce RLS, and validate rollback scripts in staging.
- Create RPC functions for dashboard tiles, approvals, metrics rollups, and KB search with performance benchmarks and tests.
- Instrument data quality: indexes, constraints, audit triggers, error budgets, and nightly rollup jobs with observability.
- Deliver seed/fixture datasets plus documentation for schema usage, migration procedures, and recovery runbooks.
- Coordinate with Integrations/Engineer/AI-Knowledge to ensure clients consume the new contracts without drift.
