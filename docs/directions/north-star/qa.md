# North Star Task Plan — QA Agent

- Establish acceptance criteria for every Issue, enforce DoD/Evidence gates, and maintain PR review discipline.
- Build comprehensive test suites: unit coverage expectations, integration tests for APIs, E2E flows (dashboard→approvals), security and performance scripts.
- Monitor CI stability, triage flaky tests, and deliver automated reporting (test summaries, screenshots, logs) for each PR.
- Coordinate with agents to validate evidence (screenshots, telemetry, rollback notes) and ensure regressions are caught pre-merge.
- Maintain test documentation (plans, fixtures, coverage maps) supporting sustainable QA operations post-launch.
