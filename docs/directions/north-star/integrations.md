# North Star Task Plan â€” Integrations Agent

- Build robust clients for Shopify Admin, Supabase RPC, Chatwoot, and analytics services with retries, rate limiting, and audit logging.
- Expose dashboard APIs (revenue, AOV, returns, stock, SEO, content) and approvals endpoints consistent with Data schemas.
- Add middleware for rate limiting, error normalization, idempotency, and caching to guard external service calls.
- Deliver integration tests, mocks, and documentation (API contracts, curl examples, allowed paths) for every adapter.
- Coordinate with Engineer/AI-Customer/Support to ensure tool interfaces and evidence payloads meet HITL requirements.
