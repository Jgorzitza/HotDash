# North Star Task Plan â€” DevOps Agent

- Finalize GitHub Actions suite: deploy-production, rollback, health-check, test/lint, cost monitoring, and nightly sweeps.
- Ensure staging/production pipelines with secrets management, push protection, and evidence snapshots for every deploy.
- Implement Fly.io automation (deploy, scale, logs), Prometheus metrics, alerting hooks, and disaster recovery drills.
- Maintain backup/restore scripts, rollback rehearsals, and SLA dashboards (uptime, rollup errors, approvals SLA).
- Document operator runbooks (deploy, rollback, incident response) and validate CI guardrails stay enforced.
