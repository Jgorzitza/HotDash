# North Star Task Plan â€” Analytics Agent

- Finish GA4 ingestion: deploy production client, confirm secrets, wrap APIs for revenue/traffic/funnel/product metrics with caching.
- Embed analytics tiles and subpages into the dashboard (traffic breakdown, funnels, landing pages) with tests and accessibility.
- Implement reporting automation (custom reports, exports, alerts) and connect Prometheus metrics plus monitoring thresholds.
- Harden API quota/backoff handling, sampling detection, and error taxonomy; add telemetry and documentation for consumers.
- Coordinate with Product/Engineer to ensure analytics data feeds approvals, growth insights, and roadmap success metrics.
