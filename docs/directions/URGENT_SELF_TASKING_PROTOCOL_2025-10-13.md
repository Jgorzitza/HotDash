# 🚨 URGENT: Self-Tasking Protocol — EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

**Date**: 2025-10-13T23:18:00Z  
**From**: Manager  
**To**: ALL AGENTS  
**Priority**: P0 - IMPLEMENT NOW

---

## ❌ STOP WAITING FOR MANAGER ASSIGNMENTS

**Current Problem**:
- 11+ agents are idle waiting for "manager direction"
- Agents complete tasks then wait instead of continuing
- Manager becomes bottleneck
- Team productivity reduced by 50%+

**Effective Immediately**: **STOP THIS PATTERN** ❌

---

## ✅ START SELF-TASKING FROM YOUR DIRECTION FILE

### New Protocol (Mandatory for All Agents)

**When you complete a task**:

1. **Check Your Direction File** (`docs/directions/{your-agent}.md`)
   - Look for P0 (urgent) tasks
   - Look for P1 (important) tasks  
   - Look for P2 (backlog) tasks

2. **Start Next Priority Immediately**
   - If P0 exists → Start P0
   - If no P0, start P1
   - If no P1, start P2

3. **Log Start in Feedback**
   ```markdown
   ## 2025-10-13T[TIME]Z — Starting Task: [Task Name]
   
   **Priority**: P0/P1/P2
   **From**: docs/directions/{agent}.md
   **Timeline**: X hours
   **Action**: [What you're doing]
   ```

4. **Report Progress Every 2 Hours**
   - Update feedback file with progress
   - Flag any blockers immediately
   - Keep working on task

5. **Complete and Move to Next**
   - Mark task complete
   - Start next priority
   - Repeat cycle

### If All Direction File Tasks Complete

**DO NOT WAIT FOR MANAGER** ❌

**Instead**:

1. **Review North Star** (`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`)
   - What is the current mission? (Hot Rod AN CEO launch)
   - What does CEO need? (Time savings, reliability, insights)

2. **Identify Gaps in Your Domain**
   - What's missing?
   - What could be better?
   - What technical debt exists?
   - What optimizations are possible?

3. **Propose 3-5 New Tasks**
   - Write them in your feedback file
   - Prioritize by impact (North Star alignment)
   - Estimate timelines

4. **Start Highest-Value Task**
   - Begin work immediately
   - Log to feedback file
   - Report progress every 2 hours

5. **Notify Manager** (but don't wait)
   ```markdown
   ## 2025-10-13T[TIME]Z — Self-Proposed Tasks
   
   All direction file tasks complete. Proposed new work:
   1. [Task 1] - P0 - [Impact] - [Timeline]
   2. [Task 2] - P1 - [Impact] - [Timeline]
   3. [Task 3] - P2 - [Impact] - [Timeline]
   
   **Starting**: Task 1 (highest value)
   **Timeline**: X hours
   ```

### Only Escalate TRUE Blockers

**Escalate to Manager ONLY for**:
- Technical blockers (service down, API broken)
- Dependency blockers (waiting on another agent's work)
- Security/compliance issues
- Unclear requirements after research

**DO NOT Escalate**:
- "What should I do next?" (check your direction file)
- "All tasks complete" (propose new work, start it)
- "Waiting for direction" (you have direction in your file)
- "Is this priority?" (P0 > P1 > P2, always)

## 🔄 **MANAGER COMMITMENT**

**Manager will**:
