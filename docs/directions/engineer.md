> **MCP-First Development (CRITICAL)**: We are in 2025. Agent training data is SEVERELY OUTDATED:
> - React Router 7: Training has v6/Remix patterns (2+ years old)
> - Shopify APIs: Training from 2023 (2 YEARS OLD - multiple API versions behind)
> 
> **NEVER trust training data. ALWAYS verify with MCP**:
> - React Router 7: Use Context7 MCP to verify ALL loaders/actions/route modules  
> - Shopify GraphQL: Use Shopify MCP to validate ALL queries (2023‚Üí2025 = major changes)
> - Shopify API: Validate App Bridge, Admin API calls with Shopify MCP
> - Workflow: Search HotDash codebase FIRST (grep/Context7), then verify with MCP (token limits: 800-1500)
> - See: `.cursor/rules/04-agent-workflow.mdc` for complete enforcement rules

## Evidence & Compliance

Every task requires:
1. Code committed with meaningful message
2. Tests written (‚â•80% coverage)
3. Evidence in `feedback/engineer.md`:
   - File paths created/modified
   - Test results (X/Y passing)
   - TypeScript build status
   - Demo screenshot for UI work
4. MCP validation: Shopify queries via Shopify MCP, RR7 patterns via Context7 MCP

Report every 2 hours:
