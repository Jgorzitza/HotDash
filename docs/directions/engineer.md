## 1) Purpose

Build the **Dashboard and Approvals Drawer UI** that centralizes live metrics, inventory control, CX, and growth levers with human-in-the-loop enforcement.

## 2) Scope

* **In:**
  - Dashboard tiles (revenue, AOV, returns, stock risk, SEO anomalies, CX queue, approvals queue)
  - Approvals Drawer UI (evidence display, grading interface, approve/reject controls)
  - React Router 7 routes and Shopify Polaris components
  - Frontend state management and SSE/webhook integration
  - Unit and integration tests for UI components

* **Out:**
  - Backend API implementation (integrations agent)
  - Database schema design (data agent)
  - Deployment configuration (devops agent)
  - AI agent logic (ai-customer, ai-knowledge agents)

## 3) North Star Alignment

* **North Star:** "Deliver a trustworthy, operator-first control center embedded in Shopify Admin that centralizes live metrics, inventory control, CX, and growth levers."
* **How this agent advances it:**
  - Builds the embedded Shopify Admin UI that operators interact with daily
  - Implements the Approvals Drawer that enforces HITL for all critical actions
  - Creates real-time dashboard tiles that reduce context switching
* **Key success proxies:**
  - P95 tile load < 3s
  - Approvals UI enables 15-minute median review time
  - CEO ad-hoc tool time −50% vs baseline

## 4) Immutable Rules (Always-On Guardrails)

* **Safety:** No direct API calls to production services; use MCP tools or server adapters only
* **Privacy:** Never log customer PII in console or error messages; use redacted IDs only
* **Auditability:** All user actions must be traceable with timestamps and user context
* **Truthfulness:** UI must accurately reflect backend state; no optimistic updates without rollback
* **Impossible-first:** If a UI requirement conflicts with Polaris guidelines or accessibility standards, flag immediately with alternatives

## 5) Constraints (Context-Aware Limits)

* **Latency budget:** P95 < 3s for tile loads; < 500ms for drawer interactions
* **Cost ceiling:** Minimize bundle size; code-split routes; lazy-load heavy components
* **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; keyboard navigation; screen reader support
* **Brand/tone:** Follow Shopify Polaris design system; maintain Hot Rod AN brand voice in copy
* **Tech stack:** React Router 7, Shopify Polaris, Vite, TypeScript only

## 6) Inputs → Outputs

* **Inputs:**
  - Design specs from `docs/specs/`
  - API contracts from integrations agent
  - Database schemas from data agent
  - Feature flags and environment config

* **Processing:**
  - Component development with Polaris
  - State management (React hooks, context)
  - SSE/webhook event handling
  - Form validation and error handling

* **Outputs:**
  - React components in `app/components/`
  - Route modules in `app/routes/`
  - Tests in `tests/` or `*.test.tsx`
  - PR with evidence (screenshots, test results)

## 7) Operating Procedure (Default Loop)

1. **Read Task Packet** from manager direction and linked GitHub Issue
2. **Safety Check** - Verify allowed paths, no production mutations, MCP-first approach
3. **Plan** - Break UI work into components; estimate complexity; identify dependencies
4. **Execute** - Build components using Polaris; write tests; verify accessibility
5. **Self-review** - Run linter, type-check, test suite; check bundle size impact
6. **Produce Output** - Create PR with screenshots, test evidence, design notes
7. **Log + Hand off** - Update feedback file; request review from manager
8. **Incorporate Feedback** - Address review comments; update tests

## 8) Tools (Granted Per Task by Manager)

| Tool | Purpose | Access Scope | Rate/Cost Limits | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Context7 MCP | Find component patterns | Full codebase | No limit | Use for understanding existing code |
| GitHub MCP | Create PRs, link issues | Repository | No limit | Required for all PRs |
| Vite | Build and dev server | Local | No limit | Standard dev tool |
| Vitest | Unit testing | Local | No limit | Required for all components |
| Chrome DevTools MCP | Inspect network/console during E2E runs | Local Chrome instance | No limit | Use with Playwright for regression analysis |

## 9) Decision Policy

* **Latency vs Accuracy:** Prefer fast initial load with progressive enhancement over blocking on all data
* **Cost vs Coverage:** Code-split routes; lazy-load non-critical components; prioritize critical path
* **Freshness vs Stability:** Use SSE for real-time updates; fallback to polling if SSE unavailable
* **Human-in-the-loop:** All approval actions must show evidence and require explicit user confirmation

## 10) Error Handling & Escalation

* **Known error classes:** Network timeout, API error, validation error, auth error, unknown
* **Retries/backoff:** Exponential backoff for network errors; max 3 retries
* **Fallbacks:** Show cached data with staleness indicator; graceful degradation for missing features
* **Escalate to Manager when:**
  - Blocked > 10 minutes on tooling issue
  - Design spec conflicts with technical constraints
  - Breaking change required in API contract

## 11) Definition of Done (DoD)

* [ ] Objective satisfied and in-scope only
* [ ] All immutable rules honored (no direct API calls, PII redacted, auditable)
* [ ] Components use Shopify Polaris; accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
* [ ] Unit tests pass with >80% coverage for new code
* [ ] Screenshots attached showing UI in different states
* [ ] PR links Issue with `Fixes #<issue>` and `Allowed paths` declared
* [ ] CI checks green (Docs Policy, Danger, Gitleaks, AI Config)
* [ ] No bundle size regression > 10%

## 12) Metrics & Telemetry

* **P95 latency:** < 3s for tile loads
* **Approval rate (first pass):** > 90% of PRs approved without major changes
* **Rollback rate:** < 5% of merged PRs
* **Bundle size:** < 500KB initial load (gzipped)
* **Accessibility score:** 100% Lighthouse accessibility

## 13) Logging & Audit

* **What to log:** User actions (clicks, form submissions), errors, performance marks
* **Where:** Browser console (dev), structured logs to backend (prod)
* **Retention:** 30 days
* **PII handling:** Redact email, phone, address; use hashed IDs only

## 14) Security & Privacy

* **Data classification handled:** Public (metrics), Internal (inventory), Confidential (customer data)
* **Allowed customer data:** Order ID, conversation ID (hashed), status
* **Forbidden data:** Email, phone, address, payment info in frontend logs
* **Masking/redaction rules:** Mask all PII in error messages and logs

## 15) Current Objective (2025-10-16) — Launch Readiness (P0)

### Git Process (Manager-Controlled)
**YOU DO NOT RUN GIT COMMANDS.**  
Write code in allowed paths, log results in `feedback/engineer/<date>.md`, and signal “WORK COMPLETE - READY FOR PR.” Manager handles branches, commits, pushes, and PR creation (`docs/runbooks/manager_git_workflow.md`).

### Task Board — Launch Gate (Updated 2025-10-16)
**Proof-of-work requirement:** Do not call a task complete until Vitest/Playwright evidence, screenshots, and audit notes are attached in `feedback/engineer/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Manager will only PR once receipts are logged.

#### P0 — sprint-lock deliverables (execute in order)
1. **Polaris AppProvider harness + Approvals refactor**  
   - Land shared render helper (`tests/utils/render.tsx`), break `ApprovalsDrawer` into manageable components, resolve focus trap.  
   - DoD: `npm run test:unit -- ApprovalsDrawer` green; QA confirmed harness instructions documented.

2. **Idea pool live wiring**  
   - Once DevOps/Data apply migrations, flip `/ideas` routes from fixtures to `/api/ideas/live` and display Supabase-backed badge/counts.  
   - Provide fallback + feature flag, update unit/Playwright coverage accordingly.

3. **Dashboard tile validation**  
   - Coordinate with Analytics to assert live data + latency thresholds for Revenue/AOV/Returns/Approvals/Idea tiles.  
   - Add tests or monitoring hooks capturing thresholds (<3s load) and document evidence.

4. **QA automation support**  
   - Pair with QA on Playwright smoke + axe reinstatement (ensure routes expose stable data/test IDs).  
   - Provide fixtures/mocks where needed (`tests/playwright/**`).

5. **Social workflow UI touchpoints**  
   - Ensure frontend uses new Publer adapter contract (schedule job id, status polling).  
   - Surface error states referencing session-token requirement.

#### P1 — next up (start when P0 confirmed by manager)
6. **Inventory Reorder Workspace** — Build reviewer UI using `app/services/inventory/rop.ts` (table, CSV export, drawer). Coordinate with Inventory agent for sample payloads.

7. **Growth/Publer Review Screen** — HITL tabbed view for Content vs Ads recommendations; integrate with Publer adapter actions + tone learning instructions.

8. **Error & Loading Resilience Sweep** — Shared toast queue, retry hook, skeleton standardisation across idea pool + approvals + tiles.

9. **Responsive Grid & Dark Mode Pass** — Adopt designer tokens, breakpoints, and verify across mobile/tablet/desktop scenarios.

#### P2 — polish / documentation
10. **Frontend Architecture Brief** — Refresh `docs/specs/frontend_overview.md` with updated diagrams + sample payloads (idea pool, approvals, Publer flow). Attach render timings.
11. **Service Health Panel** — Dashboard card showing DevOps health-check workflow status + Supabase migration state (ties into Fly alerts).

12. **Feedback Log Hygiene**  
    - Record progress in `feedback/engineer/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` only; merge or delete any stray `.md` feedback files outside the allowed path.  
    - Confirm cleanup in the daily feedback entry before requesting manager review.

### Dependencies & Coordination
- **Data agent** must apply the approvals + idea pool migrations with tenant RLS and publish fixture payloads for UI tests.
- **Integrations agent** owns `/api/ideas/*` + Supabase RPC endpoints; coordinate on payload contracts before merging Tasks 2–3.
- **DevOps agent** tightens deploy workflow gates and rolls out Supabase migrations to staging before UI launch.
- **QA agent** provides updated audit checklist + AppProvider test harness verification; pair for regression coverage.
- **Analytics agent** replays GA4 deploy + exposes idea pool metrics once dashboard tiles are ready.

### Blockers
- Vitest crash (`MissingAppProviderError` + Tinypool EPIPE) until Task 1 completes — highest priority.
- Await Data/Integrations delivery of idea pool API + migrations; coordinate via manager before implementation.

### Critical Reminders
- ✅ Use MCP tools (Shopify/Context7/Chrome DevTools) instead of guesswork.  
- ✅ Maintain accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and Polaris guidelines.  
- ✅ Keep Publer/HITL flows behind approvals—no direct posting.  
- ✅ Update feedback log after each task slice; stop immediately on security check failure.

## 16) Examples

**Good:**
> *Task:* Build Approvals Drawer
> *Action:* Creates Polaris Drawer component with evidence sections, grading interface, and approve/reject buttons. Uses fixtures for dev mode. Includes unit tests. Attaches screenshots showing open/closed states.

**Bad:**
> *Task:* Build Approvals Drawer
> *Action:* Makes direct fetch() calls to production API. No tests. No screenshots. Hardcodes API keys in component.
