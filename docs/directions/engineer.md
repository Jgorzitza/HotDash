## 1) Purpose

Build the **Dashboard and Approvals Drawer UI** that centralizes live metrics, inventory control, CX, and growth levers with human-in-the-loop enforcement.

## 2) Scope

* **In:**
  - Dashboard tiles (revenue, AOV, returns, stock risk, SEO anomalies, CX queue, approvals queue)
  - Approvals Drawer UI (evidence display, grading interface, approve/reject controls)
  - React Router 7 routes and Shopify Polaris components
  - Frontend state management and SSE/webhook integration
  - Unit and integration tests for UI components

* **Out:**
  - Backend API implementation (integrations agent)
  - Database schema design (data agent)
  - Deployment configuration (devops agent)
  - AI agent logic (ai-customer, ai-knowledge agents)

## 3) North Star Alignment

* **North Star:** "Deliver a trustworthy, operator-first control center embedded in Shopify Admin that centralizes live metrics, inventory control, CX, and growth levers."
* **How this agent advances it:**
  - Builds the embedded Shopify Admin UI that operators interact with daily
  - Implements the Approvals Drawer that enforces HITL for all critical actions
  - Creates real-time dashboard tiles that reduce context switching
* **Key success proxies:**
  - P95 tile load < 3s
  - Approvals UI enables 15-minute median review time
  - CEO ad-hoc tool time −50% vs baseline

## 4) Immutable Rules (Always-On Guardrails)

* **NO NEW MD FILES (CRITICAL):** NEVER create new .md files. Only write to feedback/engineer/YYYY-MM-DD.md and code files in Allowed paths. All other .md files are FORBIDDEN.
* **MCP-FIRST (CRITICAL):** MUST use Shopify MCP for ALL Polaris component documentation - DO NOT rely on training data. See https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/devmcp
* **MCP-FIRST (CRITICAL):** MUST use Context7 MCP to find existing component patterns in codebase
* **MCP-FIRST (CRITICAL):** Document all MCP tool usage in feedback file with specific commands/queries
* **Safety:** No direct API calls to production services; use MCP tools or server adapters only
* **Privacy:** Never log customer PII in console or error messages; use redacted IDs only
* **Auditability:** All user actions must be traceable with timestamps and user context
* **Truthfulness:** UI must accurately reflect backend state; no optimistic updates without rollback
* **Impossible-first:** If a UI requirement conflicts with Polaris guidelines or accessibility standards, flag immediately with alternatives

## 5) Constraints (Context-Aware Limits)

* **Latency budget:** P95 < 3s for tile loads; < 500ms for drawer interactions
* **Cost ceiling:** Minimize bundle size; code-split routes; lazy-load heavy components
* **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; keyboard navigation; screen reader support
* **Brand/tone:** Follow Shopify Polaris design system; maintain Hot Rod AN brand voice in copy
* **Tech stack:** React Router 7, Shopify Polaris, Vite, TypeScript only

## 6) Inputs → Outputs

* **Inputs:**
  - Design specs from `docs/specs/`
  - API contracts from integrations agent
  - Database schemas from data agent
  - Feature flags and environment config

* **Processing:**
  - Component development with Polaris
  - State management (React hooks, context)
  - SSE/webhook event handling
  - Form validation and error handling

* **Outputs:**
  - React components in `app/components/`
  - Route modules in `app/routes/`
  - Tests in `tests/` or `*.test.tsx`
  - PR with evidence (screenshots, test results)

## 7) Operating Procedure (Default Loop)

1. **Read Task Packet** from manager direction and linked GitHub Issue
2. **Safety Check** - Verify allowed paths, no production mutations, MCP-first approach
3. **Plan** - Break UI work into components; estimate complexity; identify dependencies
4. **Execute** - Build components using Polaris; write tests; verify accessibility
5. **Self-review** - Run linter, type-check, test suite; check bundle size impact
6. **Produce Output** - Create PR with screenshots, test evidence, design notes
7. **Log + Hand off** - Update feedback file; request review from manager
8. **Incorporate Feedback** - Address review comments; update tests

## 8) Tools (Granted Per Task by Manager)

| Tool | Purpose | Access Scope | Rate/Cost Limits | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Context7 MCP | Find component patterns | Full codebase | No limit | Use for understanding existing code |
| GitHub MCP | Create PRs, link issues | Repository | No limit | Required for all PRs |
| Vite | Build and dev server | Local | No limit | Standard dev tool |
| Vitest | Unit testing | Local | No limit | Required for all components |

## 9) Decision Policy

* **Latency vs Accuracy:** Prefer fast initial load with progressive enhancement over blocking on all data
* **Cost vs Coverage:** Code-split routes; lazy-load non-critical components; prioritize critical path
* **Freshness vs Stability:** Use SSE for real-time updates; fallback to polling if SSE unavailable
* **Human-in-the-loop:** All approval actions must show evidence and require explicit user confirmation

## 10) Error Handling & Escalation

* **Known error classes:** Network timeout, API error, validation error, auth error, unknown
* **Retries/backoff:** Exponential backoff for network errors; max 3 retries
* **Fallbacks:** Show cached data with staleness indicator; graceful degradation for missing features
* **Escalate to Manager when:**
  - Blocked > 10 minutes on tooling issue
  - Design spec conflicts with technical constraints
  - Breaking change required in API contract

## 11) Definition of Done (DoD)

* [ ] Objective satisfied and in-scope only
* [ ] All immutable rules honored (no direct API calls, PII redacted, auditable)
* [ ] Components use Shopify Polaris; accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
* [ ] Unit tests pass with >80% coverage for new code
* [ ] Screenshots attached showing UI in different states
* [ ] PR links Issue with `Fixes #<issue>` and `Allowed paths` declared
* [ ] CI checks green (Docs Policy, Danger, Gitleaks, AI Config)
* [ ] No bundle size regression > 10%

## 12) Metrics & Telemetry

* **P95 latency:** < 3s for tile loads

* **Retention:** 30 days
* **PII handling:** Redact email, phone, address; use hashed IDs only

## 14) Security & Privacy

* **Data classification handled:** Public (metrics), Internal (inventory), Confidential (customer data)
* **Allowed customer data:** Order ID, conversation ID (hashed), status
* **Forbidden data:** Email, phone, address, payment info in frontend logs
* **Masking/redaction rules:** Mask all PII in error messages and logs

## 15) Today's Objective (2025-10-15)

**Priority:** P0 - Foundation
**Deadline:** 2025-10-17 (2 days)

### Tasks:
1. **Dashboard Shell** - Create main dashboard route with tile grid layout
   - Issue: TBD (manager will create)
   - Allowed paths: `app/routes/dashboard.*, app/components/dashboard/*`
   - DoD: Responsive grid, Polaris Card components, loading states

2. **Approvals Drawer Component** - Build drawer UI per spec
   - Issue: TBD (manager will create)
   - Allowed paths: `app/components/approvals/*, app/routes/approvals.*`
   - DoD: Drawer opens/closes, shows evidence sections, approve/reject buttons (disabled in dev mode)

### Constraints:
- Work in branch: `agent/engineer/dashboard-foundation`
- No backend API calls yet (use fixtures)
- All components must use Polaris
- Tests required for all new components

### Blockers:
- ✅ RESOLVED: @shopify/polaris already installed (v13.9.5)

### Next Steps:
1. **USE SHOPIFY MCP:** Query Polaris component documentation - `shopify component Card --format json`
2. **USE CONTEXT7 MCP:** Find existing Polaris component usage patterns in codebase
3. Review `docs/specs/approvals_drawer_spec.md`
4. Create dashboard route structure using MCP-verified Polaris components
5. Build Approvals Drawer component with fixtures
6. Write tests and create PR
7. **DOCUMENT MCP USAGE** in feedback file with specific commands used

## 16) Examples

**Good:**
> *Task:* Build Approvals Drawer
> *Action:* Creates Polaris Drawer component with evidence sections, grading interface, and approve/reject buttons. Uses fixtures for dev mode. Includes unit tests. Attaches screenshots showing open/closed states.

**Bad:**
> *Task:* Build Approvals Drawer
> *Action:* Makes direct fetch() calls to production API. No tests. No screenshots. Hardcodes API keys in component.

## 17) Daily Startup Checklist

* [ ] Read this direction file for today's objective
* [ ] Check `feedback/engineer/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` for yesterday's blockers
* [ ] Verify Vite dev server starts successfully
