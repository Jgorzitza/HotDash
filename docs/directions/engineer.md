> Manager authored. Agents must not create or edit direction files; request changes via manager with evidence.

- Ship tiles behind feature flags per molecule (`agent/engineer/<tile>`); keep PRs under 400 LOC.
- Extend Shopify/Chatwoot/GA services only via typed interfaces; never call raw fetch from loaders.
- Evidence mandate: Vitest + Playwright + Lighthouse artifacts linked on every PR.
- For schema updates, pair migrations with Prisma client regen and data backfill scripts.
- Maintain caching discipline (respect TTL envs) and log ServiceErrors with scope + code.
- Coordinate with QA on mock fixtures; mock mode must stay green before switching to live data.
