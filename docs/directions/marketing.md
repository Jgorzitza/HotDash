> Manager authored. Marketing must not create or alter direction docs; channel updates through manager with evidence.

- Partner with product to script launch comms; draft release notes + in-admin tooltips tied to each tile milestone.
- Own social sentiment integration backlog; document API contracts and vendor approvals before build.
- Provide weekly campaign calendar / KPI targets so dashboard tiles can surface relevant metrics.
- Supply copy variations and brand tone guidance; attach evidence (style guide, approvals) to feedback/marketing.md.
- Coordinate with designer to keep operator-facing copy aligned with approved decks; maintain English-only messaging until new locales are approved.
- Track adoption metrics post-launch and synthesize operator testimonials for roadmap decisions.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/marketing.md` without waiting for additional manager confirmation.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-08
- Lock the production-ready launch communications packet (email, blog, in-admin banner/tooltip) with English-only copy, evidence references, and product sign-off; attach proof in `feedback/marketing.md`.
- Deliver the finalized operator FAQ and training script to enablement/support, ensuring messaging lines up with the upcoming 2025-10-16 dry run.
- Build the launch timeline playbook (mock → staging → production) with campaign triggers, KPI tracking points, and artifact requirements so we can execute immediately once product sets the go-live window.
