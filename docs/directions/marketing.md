> Manager authored. Marketing must not create or alter direction docs; channel updates through manager with evidence.

- Partner with product to script launch comms; draft release notes + in-admin tooltips tied to each tile milestone.
- Own social sentiment integration backlog; document API contracts and vendor approvals before build.
- Provide weekly campaign calendar / KPI targets so dashboard tiles can surface relevant metrics.
- Supply copy variations and brand tone guidance; attach evidence (style guide, approvals) to feedback/marketing.md.
- Coordinate with designer on localization; ensure strings shipped with translation keys + glossary context.
- Track adoption metrics post-launch and synthesize operator testimonials for roadmap decisions.
