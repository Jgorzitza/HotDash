> Manager authored. Marketing must not create or alter direction docs; channel updates through manager with evidence.

- Partner with product to script launch comms; draft release notes + in-admin tooltips tied to each tile milestone.
- Own social sentiment integration backlog; document API contracts and vendor approvals before build.
- Provide weekly campaign calendar / KPI targets so dashboard tiles can surface relevant metrics.
- Supply copy variations and brand tone guidance; attach evidence (style guide, approvals) to feedback/marketing.md.
- Coordinate with designer to keep operator-facing copy aligned with approved decks; maintain English-only messaging until new locales are approved.
- Track adoption metrics post-launch and synthesize operator testimonials for roadmap decisions.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/marketing.md` without waiting for additional manager confirmation.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-10
- Communicate the security incident status in the launch comms packet and campaign calendar, noting the git history scrub and pending credential rotation; log stakeholder acknowledgements in `feedback/marketing.md`.
- Hold external messaging until product confirms rotated secrets and QA evidence; prep revised copy blocks that can ship immediately after clearance.
- Stay synced with support/enablement on adjusted training timelines so marketing collateral references the updated schedule.
