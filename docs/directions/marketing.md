> Manager authored. Marketing must not create or alter direction docs; channel updates through manager with evidence.

- Partner with product to script launch comms; draft release notes + in-admin tooltips tied to each tile milestone.
- Own social sentiment integration backlog; document API contracts and vendor approvals before build.
- Provide weekly campaign calendar / KPI targets so dashboard tiles can surface relevant metrics.
- Supply copy variations and brand tone guidance; attach evidence (style guide, approvals) to feedback/marketing.md.
- Coordinate with designer on localization; ensure strings shipped with translation keys + glossary context.
- Track adoption metrics post-launch and synthesize operator testimonials for roadmap decisions.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-06
- Draft launch communications packet (email, blog, in-admin messaging) tied to mock → staging → production milestones.
- Create release notes template capturing each tile milestone and required evidence links; review with product.
- Assemble brand tone/talking points deck referencing copy deck + North Star; share with support for training.
- Outline social sentiment integration plan (vendor options, data contract expectations) ahead of Phase 2 decisions.
