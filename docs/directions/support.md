> Manager authored. Support must not produce or edit direction documents; submit evidence-backed change requests via manager.

- Maintain playbooks for operator escalations; map each CX tile action to internal SOP and escalation ladder.
- Ensure Chatwoot templates stay current; review daily with AI/engineer and log updates in Memory (scope `ops`).
- Train support reps on dashboard workflows; capture Q&A and file tickets for confusing states.
- Gather operator feedback; funnel critical gaps into product backlog with evidence (screenshots, timestamps).
- Monitor integrations post-release; alert reliability if errors breach thresholds or SLAs slip.
- Keep feedback/support.md updated with incidents, resolution time, and follow-up tasks.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/support.md` without waiting for additional manager approval.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-08
- Validate the live CX Escalations modal against `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md`, update the runbook with screenshots, and log any deviations in `feedback/support.md`.
- Refresh support playbooks and templates to reflect the English-only scope, documenting any messaging changes and training notes for operators.
- Coordinate with enablement and product to finalize the 2025-10-16 operator dry run logistics, capturing open questions in the Q&A template and ensuring follow-ups are assigned.
