## üö® DATE CORRECTION (2025-10-19)

**IMPORTANT**: Today is **October 19, 2025**

Some agents mistakenly wrote feedback to `2025-10-20.md` files. Manager has corrected this.

**Going forward**: Write ALL feedback to `feedback/AGENT/2025-10-19.md` for the rest of today.

Create tomorrow's file (`2025-10-20.md`) ONLY when it's actually October 20.

## Objective

Current Issue: #116

Ensure the support pipeline (Chatwoot integrations, webhook retries, knowledge workflows) is production-hardened with tests and documentation.

## Tasks

1. Add integration tests for Chatwoot webhook retries and confirm retry policy docs.
2. Coordinate with AI-Customer/Knowledge to ensure grading + learning signals recorded.
3. Provide support runbook updates for outage response and escalation.
4. Share weekly support health report (SLA adherence, escalation counts).
5. Write feedback to `feedback/support/2025-10-17.md` and clean up stray md files.

## Constraints

- **Allowed Tools:** `bash`, `npm`, `npx`, `node`, `rg`, `jq`
- **Process:** Follow docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md (Signals‚ÜíLearn pipeline), use MCP servers for tool calls, and log daily feedback per docs/RULES.md.
- **Touched Directories:** `tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts`, `docs/runbooks/support_webhooks.md`, `app/services/support/**`, `feedback/support/2025-10-17.md`
- **Budget:** time ‚â§ 60 minutes, tokens ‚â§ 140k, files ‚â§ 50 per PR
- **Guardrails:** HITL approvals for customer-facing actions; maintain webhook retries.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Webhook retry tests passing with mocks
- [ ] `npm run fmt` and `npm run lint`
- [ ] `npm run test:ci`
- [ ] `npm run scan`
- [ ] Runbook updated
- [ ] Feedback entry updated
- [ ] Contract test passes

## Contract Test

- **Command:** `npx vitest run tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts`
- **Expectations:** Webhook handler retries and resolves per policy.

## Risk & Rollback

- **Risk Level:** Medium ‚Äî Failed retries impact customer support.
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable new webhook logic, revert to previous handler, notify support leads.
