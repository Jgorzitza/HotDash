### SUPPORT-002: Create Test Customer Scenarios

**Create 20+ test conversations for customer agent**:

**Scenario Types**:
1. **Order Status** (5 scenarios):
   - "Where is my order?" (simple)
   - "My order is late" (escalation)
   - "Wrong item received" (refund/replacement)
   - "Cancel my order" (cancellation flow)
   - "Change shipping address" (modification)

2. **Product Questions** (5 scenarios):
   - "Is this in stock?" (availability)
   - "What's the difference between X and Y?" (comparison)
   - "Do you ship to Canada?" (shipping)
   - "What's your return policy?" (policy)
   - "Product defect" (quality issue)

3. **Account Issues** (3 scenarios):
   - "Reset my password" (account access)
   - "Update my email" (profile change)
   - "Delete my account" (GDPR request)

4. **Billing Questions** (3 scenarios):
   - "Charge on my card?" (payment inquiry)
   - "Refund status?" (refund tracking)
   - "Payment failed" (checkout error)

5. **Escalations** (4 scenarios):
   - Angry customer (tone management)
   - Multiple failed orders (complex issue)
   - Chargeback threat (high risk)
   - VIP customer (priority handling)

**Format** (create in Chatwoot):
- Real conversations (use test account)
- Tag each with scenario type
- Vary tone (friendly, frustrated, neutral, angry)
- Include edge cases

**Purpose**: Customer agent will learn from these patterns

### SUPPORT-003: Chatwoot Health Monitoring Dashboard

**Build monitoring for CX operations**:

**Create**: `app/routes/admin.chatwoot-health.tsx` (if allowed) OR document for DevOps

**Metrics to Display**:
- Service uptime (current: ‚úÖ operational)
- Response time (median, P90)
- Conversation count (open, pending, resolved)
- SLA compliance (% under 2h target)
- Channel breakdown (email vs SMS vs chat)
- Agent availability

**Integration**:
- Use existing health check: `scripts/ops/check-chatwoot-health.mjs`
- Display in Settings ‚Üí Integrations tab (Engineer builds UI)

---

## Current Status

**Chatwoot Service**: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- Email: Working
- Live Chat: Working  
- SMS: Working (via Twilio)
- Health checks: Passing (from feedback 2025-10-20)

**Your Work**: Test all channels, create test data, build monitoring

---

## Work Protocol

**1. MCP Tools**:
```bash
# If documenting Chatwoot patterns:
mcp_context7_get-library-docs("/chatwoot/chatwoot", "channels")

# Or web search for latest Chatwoot docs
```

**2. Coordinate**:
- **AI-Customer**: Provide test scenarios for agent training
- **Engineer**: Provide health metrics for UI display
- **DevOps**: Share health check results

**3. Reporting (Every 2 hours)**:
```md
## YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ ‚Äî Support: Chatwoot Testing

**Working On**: SUPPORT-001 (multi-channel testing)
**Progress**: 2/3 channels tested

**Evidence**:
- Email: ‚úÖ 5 test conversations created (conversation IDs: 101-105)
- SMS: ‚úÖ 3 test messages sent and received
- Chat: ‚è∏Ô∏è Testing in progress
- Screenshots: 8 screenshots documenting flows

**Blockers**: None
**Next**: Complete chat testing, start scenario creation
```

---

## Definition of Done

**Multi-Channel Testing**:
- [ ] All 3 channels tested (email, SMS, chat)
- [ ] Agent reply flow works on all channels
- [ ] Screenshots documenting each channel
- [ ] Response times documented
- [ ] Issues documented (or none found)

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] 20+ conversations created across 5 categories
- [ ] Each tagged appropriately in Chatwoot
- [ ] Varied tones (friendly to angry)
- [ ] Edge cases included
- [ ] Documented in feedback

**Health Monitoring**:
- [ ] Metrics identified
- [ ] Data source confirmed (existing health check script)

---

## Critical Reminders

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Test ALL 3 channels thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Create realistic test scenarios (customer agent learns from these)
- ‚úÖ Document issues immediately
- ‚úÖ Provide health metrics to Engineer

**DO NOT**:
- ‚ùå Skip any channel (all must work)
- ‚ùå Create only happy-path scenarios (include escalations)
- ‚ùå Assume email = SMS = chat (test each separately)

---

**Day 2**: SUPPORT-002 (test scenarios - 2h)
**Day 3**: SUPPORT-003 (health dashboard - 1h)

## Credential & Blocker Protocol

### If You Need Credentials:

**Step 1**: Check `vault/` directory first
- Google credentials: `vault/occ/google/`
- Bing credentials: `vault/occ/bing/`
- Publer credentials: `vault/occ/publer/`
- Other services: `vault/occ/<service-name>/`

**Step 2**: If not in vault, report in feedback:
```md
## HH:MM - Credential Request
**Need**: [specific credential name]
**For**: [what task/feature]
**Checked**: vault/occ/<path>/ (not found)
**Status**: Moving to next task, awaiting CEO
```

**Step 3**: Move to next task immediately (don't wait idle)

### If You Hit a True Blocker:

**Before reporting blocker, verify you**:
1. ‚úÖ Checked vault for credentials
2. ‚úÖ Inspected codebase for existing patterns
3. ‚úÖ Pulled Context7 docs for the library
4. ‚úÖ Reviewed RULES.md and relevant direction sections

**If still blocked**:
```md
## HH:MM - Blocker Report
**Blocked On**: [specific issue]
**What I Tried**: [list 3+ things you attempted]
**Vault Checked**: [yes/no, paths checked]
**Docs Pulled**: [Context7 libraries consulted]
**Asking CEO**: [specific question or guidance needed]
**Moving To**: [next task ID you're starting]
```

**Then immediately move to next task** - CEO will respond when available

**Key Principle**: NEVER sit idle. If one task blocked ‚Üí start next task right away.
