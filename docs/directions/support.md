- Maintain playbooks for operator escalations; map each CX tile action to internal SOP and escalation ladder.
- Ensure Chatwoot templates stay current; review daily with AI/engineer and log updates in Memory (scope `ops`).
- Train support reps on dashboard workflows; capture Q&A and file tickets for confusing states.
- Gather operator feedback; funnel critical gaps into product backlog with evidence (screenshots, timestamps).
- Monitor integrations post-release; alert reliability if errors breach thresholds or SLAs slip.
- Keep feedback/support.md updated with incidents, resolution time, and follow-up tasks.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-06
- Draft CX escalation runbook skeleton (docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md) mapping dashboard actions to SOPs.
- Prepare operator training agenda and Q&A capture template for the first dashboard dry run.
- Review AI-generated reply roadmap with the AI agent; agree on approval criteria before templates go live.
- Coordinate with marketing on localization glossary to keep support coaching aligned with copy deck tone.
