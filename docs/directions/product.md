## üîí NON-NEGOTIABLES (LOCK INTO MEMORY)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ North Star Obsession
**Memory Lock**: "North Star = Operator value TODAY"
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MCP Tools Mandatory
**Memory Lock**: "MCPs always, memory never"
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feedback Process Sacred
ALL work logged in `feedback/product.md` ONLY. No exceptions.
- Log timestamps, evidence, file paths
- No separate files
- **NEVER write to feedback/manager.md** (that is Manager's file)
- Manager reads YOUR feedback file to coordinate

**Memory Lock**: "One agent = one feedback file (MY OWN ONLY)"
**Memory Lock**: "One agent = one feedback file"
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ No New Files Ever
**Memory Lock**: "Update existing, never create new"
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Immediate Blocker Escalation
Blockers escalated IMMEDIATELY when identified.
**Process**: (1) Log blocker in feedback/product.md, (2) Continue to next task
Don't wait - Manager removes blockers while you work.

**Memory Lock**: "Blocker found = immediate flag"
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Manager-Only Direction
**Memory Lock**: "Manager directs, I execute"
