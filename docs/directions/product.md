# Product — Direction (Operator Control Center)
## Canon
- North Star: docs/NORTH_STAR.md
- Git & Delivery Protocol: docs/git_protocol.md
- Direction Governance: docs/directions/README.md
- MCP Allowlist: docs/policies/mcp-allowlist.json
- Credential Map: docs/ops/credential_index.md
- Agent Launch Checklist (manager executed): docs/runbooks/agent_launch_checklist.md

> Manager authored. Submit evidence-backed change requests to manager; do not create new direction artifacts.

## Local Execution Policy (Auto-Run)

You may run local, non-interactive commands without approval. Guardrails:

- Scope: local repo and analysis scripts; no remote infra or git mutations under auto-run.
- Non-interactive: disable pagers; avoid interactive prompts.
- Evidence: log timestamp, command, outputs in feedback/product.md.
- Secrets: load from vault/env; never print values.
- Retry: 2 attempts then escalate with logs.

- Own outcome roadmap: prioritize tile molecules by operator impact; keep living backlog in Linear with evidence links.
- Define success metrics (activation rate, SLA resolution time, anomaly response) and ensure telemetry stories land in each sprint.
- Run weekly customer calls; capture quotes + decisions in packages/memory (scope `ops`).
- Coordinate release reviews: mock → staging → production with artifact bundle (tests, metrics, comms) before go/no-go.
- Keep docs/strategy updated when scope shifts; flag scope creep or dependency risk in manager feedback daily.
- Stack guardrails: ensure roadmap, comms, and approvals align with `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` (Supabase-only backend, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7, OpenAI + LlamaIndex); reject proposals that diverge.
- Keep Shopify documentation close: docs/dev/appreact.md, docs/dev/admin-graphql.md, docs/dev/adminext-shopify.md, docs/dev/storefront-mcp.md to ensure roadmap decisions align with platform capabilities.
- Approve copy/UX changes only with paired evidence from designer + engineer (screenshot + test).
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; record progress and blockers in `feedback/product.md` without waiting for additional manager approval.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-12
Work each item to completion and log progress in `feedback/product.md`, including timestamps, evidence links, and next actions. If a dependency blocks you, schedule the follow-up and chase it until resolved instead of reassigning it.

### 📋 EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT REMINDER (2025-10-11T22:35Z)

**QA validates all completed tasks - provide proof**:
- ✅ Document paths: `docs/strategy/market-expansion.md (sections: A, B, C)`
- ✅ Artifacts: `artifacts/product/roadmap-2025-q4.pdf`
- ✅ Spreadsheet/analysis: `artifacts/product/pricing-model.xlsx (3 scenarios)`
- ✅ Review status: `Reviewed with 3 stakeholders on 2025-10-11`

**NOT Acceptable**: "Strategy complete", "Analysis done", "Document ready"

### 2025-10-11 Execution Snapshot
- 2025-10-11T08:12Z — Logged sanitized history push hash `af1d9f1` plus “no rotation” posture in Linear (`DEPLOY-147`) and Memory (scope `ops`); DEPLOY-147 impact now highlights QA smoke evidence, Playwright rerun, embed-token confirmation, and nightly AI logging sync as gating items.
- 2025-10-11T11:05Z — Reliability reconfirmed existing Supabase credentials in service; call recorded in Linear comments, Memory recap, SCC/DPA escalation threads, and the nightly AI logging/index plan.
- SCC/DPA escalations: compliance/legal tracking paused schedule, requested embed-token readiness timestamps, and expect nightly AI logging/index cadence summaries embedded in the shared evidence plan alongside QA updates.
- Backlog freeze reaffirmed: all DEPLOY/OCC tickets stay in `Blocked` until QA’s sub-300 ms `?mock=0` proof, Playwright rerun, embed-token readiness signal, and matching AI logging artifacts land; stakeholders remain on hold per #occ-stakeholders update.
- Operator dry-run pre-read polished: tightened success metrics, evidence capture checklist, and attendee logistics in `docs/strategy/operator_dry_run_pre_read_draft.md`; ready to publish alongside Memory/Linear updates the moment staging access and embed token clear.
- Backup work active: aligning nightly AI logging/index summaries, prepping Memory template, and coordinating enablement/support comms so the pre-read ships immediately when QA evidence unlocks DEPLOY-147.
- 2025-10-11T14:05Z — Logged SCC/DPA escalation touchpoint with compliance/legal; shared latest embed-token status + QA blocker summary and captured next follow-up in Memory.
- 2025-10-11T14:12Z — Synced with AI/data on nightly logging + index cadence; verified latest regression bundle and index metadata ready for DEPLOY-147 evidence once QA unblocks.
- 2025-10-11T14:25Z — Finalized dry-run pre-read edits (checklist, metrics, stakeholder notes) and staged publication steps so we can push to Memory/#occ-product immediately after staging access opens.

## 🚨 LAUNCH CRITICAL REFOCUS (2025-10-11T22:50Z)

**CEO Decision**: Emergency refocus on launch gates

**Your Status**: PAUSED - Resume post-launch planning after launch gates complete

**Why PAUSED**: Your 115 tasks are strategic/post-launch work. Launch gates require technical implementation (Engineer, QA, Designer).

**When to Resume**: After all 7 launch gates complete (~48-72 hours)

**What You've Accomplished**: Comprehensive product strategy, roadmaps, GTM plans - all excellent work that positions us for post-launch success.

**Stand By For**: Pilot customer feedback, metrics analysis, post-launch iteration planning

---

**Your 115 tasks remain in direction file - will resume after launch.**

---

## ✅ RESUME WORK (2025-10-11T23:20Z)

**Engineer Progress**: 5/7 launch gates complete! 🎉

**Your Status**: Resume your paused tasks - no idle agents

**Rationale**: Engineer making excellent progress. While they finish last 2 gates, you can continue valuable post-launch work.

**Your Tasks**: Resume where you left off in your expanded task list

**Evidence**: Continue providing file paths, test results, documentation per QA standards

**Coordinate**: Support launch if needed, otherwise continue your strategic work

**Timeline**: Work until launch gates 100% complete, then shift to launch support/iteration
