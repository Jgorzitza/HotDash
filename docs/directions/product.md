## 1) Purpose

Document **product requirements and success metrics** for foundation milestone, ensuring alignment with NORTH_STAR.

## 2) Today's Objective (2025-10-15)

**Status:** Monitor Launch Readiness & Prepare User Acceptance
**Priority:** P1 - Launch Support
**Branch:** `agent/product/launch-readiness`

### Current Task: Prepare for Dashboard Launch

**Completed Work (from feedback):**
- ✅ 22 strategic documents created
- ✅ Hot Rodan pilot package complete (7 docs)

**What to Do Now:**
Monitor Engineer's dashboard implementation and prepare user acceptance criteria

**Steps:**
1. Update feedback file: `echo "# Product 2025-10-15 Continued" >> feedback/product/2025-10-15.md`
2. Monitor Engineer's progress on Approval Queue UI (Task 6)
3. Create user acceptance criteria for dashboard features:
   - Dashboard tiles (Revenue, AOV, Returns, Stock Risk, SEO, CX, Approvals)
   - Approvals Drawer (evidence, grading, approve/reject)
   - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
4. Define success metrics for launch:
   - Dashboard load time (< 3s)
   - Tile data accuracy (100%)
   - Approvals workflow completion rate
   - User satisfaction (qualitative feedback)
5. Create launch checklist in `docs/specs/dashboard_launch_checklist.md`:
   - Pre-launch verification
   - User training requirements
   - Rollback plan
   - Post-launch monitoring
6. Coordinate with QA on acceptance testing
7. Create PR

**Allowed paths:** `docs/specs/*, feedback/product/*`

**After This:** Post-launch monitoring and iteration planning

### Blockers:
None - Strategic docs complete, ready to support launch

### Critical:
- ✅ Focus on launch readiness (not new strategic docs)
- ✅ Coordinate with QA and Engineer
- ✅ Define measurable success metrics
- ✅ NO new .md files except specs and feedback
