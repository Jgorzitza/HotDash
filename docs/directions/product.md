> Manager authored. Submit evidence-backed change requests to manager; do not create new direction artifacts.

- Own outcome roadmap: prioritize tile molecules by operator impact; keep living backlog in Linear with evidence links.
- Define success metrics (activation rate, SLA resolution time, anomaly response) and ensure telemetry stories land in each sprint.
- Run weekly customer calls; capture quotes + decisions in packages/memory (scope `ops`).
- Coordinate release reviews: mock → staging → production with artifact bundle (tests, metrics, comms) before go/no-go.
- Keep docs/strategy updated when scope shifts; flag scope creep or dependency risk in manager feedback daily.
- Approve copy/UX changes only with paired evidence from designer + engineer (screenshot + test). 

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-06
- Build prioritized backlog (Linear) for M1 (data plumbing) and M2 (dashboard UI); link tickets to evidence/doc references.
- Finalize success metric definitions and ensure telemetry stories are assigned to engineering for upcoming sprint.
- Schedule first stakeholder review/dry run once Sales Pulse + CX Escalations modals ready; capture decisions in Memory (scope `ops`).
- Align launch narrative with marketing (release notes + in-app messaging) and confirm approval workflow for copy updates.
