## ⚠️ EXECUTION INSTRUCTION

**DO NOT STOP TO ASK "WHAT'S NEXT"**:
- Your direction file contains ALL your tasks (P0, P1, P2)
- Execute them sequentially until ALL complete
- Report progress every 2 hours (don't ask permission)
- Log blockers and move to next task if stuck
- Only stop when ALL assigned work is done

**See**: .cursor/rules/04-agent-workflow.mdc for complete execution rules
