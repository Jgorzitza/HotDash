**Owner**: Manager (me)  
**Effective**: 2025-10-21T04:12Z  
**Version**: 5.2  
**Status**: ACTIVE ‚Äî Phase 6-13 Coordination

---

## Objective

**Coordinate all 17 agents through Phases 6-13 completion with ZERO idle time**

---

## MANDATORY MCP USAGE (I MUST FOLLOW TOO)

```bash
# Context7 for any technical decisions
mcp_context7_get-library-docs("/library/path", "topic")

# Fly MCP for deployments
mcp_fly_fly-status("--app", "hotdash-staging")

# Log ALL tool usage in feedback/manager/2025-10-21.md
```

**I am NOT exempt from MCP-first rules. Lead by example.**

---

## ACTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES (Continuous)

### 1. Agent Coordination (Daily - 6h/day)

**Read ALL feedback 3x daily**:
- Morning (9am): Unblock overnight issues
- Midday (1pm): Check progress, answer questions
- Evening (6pm): Review day's work, plan tomorrow

**Unblock agents <1 hour**:
- Credential requests: Pull from vault, provide immediately
- Technical questions: Use MCP tools to find answers
- Dependency conflicts: Coordinate sequential work
- Never let agent wait idle

**Track Progress**:
- Maintain progress table in feedback/manager/2025-10-21.md
- Update after each feedback review
- Identify lagging agents immediately

---

### 2. CEO Checkpoint Management (After Each Phase)

**After Phase 6 Complete**:
1. Engineer finishes ENG-014 to ENG-022
2. Designer validates DES-009
3. QA tests pass QA-002
4. Pilot smoke tests pass PILOT-004
5. I present to CEO:
   - Screenshots of Settings page
   - Demo of drag/drop, theme switching
   - Test results
   - Phase 7-8 plan
6. CEO approves ‚Üí Direct Phase 7-8 work
7. CEO rejects ‚Üí Direct fixes, retest

**Checkpoint Format in feedback**:
```md
## CEO Checkpoint 5 - Phase 6 Complete

**Built**:
- Settings page (4 tabs)
- Drag & drop tile reorder
- Theme selector (Light/Dark/Auto)
- Tile visibility toggles
- Default view persistence

**Evidence**:
- Screenshots: (attached)
- Live demo: https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/settings
- Tests: QA-002 passing, Pilot smoke tests green
- Designer sign-off: DES-009 complete

**Next Phase**:
- Phase 7-8: Growth (SEO, Ads, Social) - 18h total
- Agents: SEO, Ads, Content, Integrations, Analytics
- Timeline: 2-3 days

**Ready for approval?**
```

---

### 3. Database Migration Application (As Needed)

**When Data creates migrations**:
1. Review SQL (no DROP, no data loss)
2. Verify RLS policies included
3. Apply via Supabase console: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f migration.sql`
4. Verify tables created
5. Confirm to Data agent
6. Unblock dependent agents (Engineer, QA)

**Migrations Pending Apply**:
- DATA-006: Performance indexes (after creation)
- DATA-008: Phase 7-13 tables (after planning)
- AI-KNOWLEDGE-001: knowledge_base table (after creation)

---

### 4. Git Operations (Continuous)

**Merge Strategy**:
- Review PRs from agents
- Verify CI green (Docs Policy, Gitleaks, Danger, AI config)
- Merge after QA approval
- Deploy after each phase
- Never force-push to main

**Commit Review**:
```bash
git log --oneline manager-reopen-20251021 --since="1 day ago"
```
- Check agent is following commit style
- Verify file ownership respected
- Check for conflicts

---

### 5. Tool-First Enforcement (Daily Audits)

**Verify Agents Using MCP Tools**:
```bash
# Check each agent's feedback for MCP evidence
grep -E "Context7|MCP|web_search" feedback/*/2025-10-21.md
```

**Expected**: 4+ MCP calls per agent per day

**If agent not using tools**:
1. Flag in their direction file
2. Remind of MCP-first policy
3. Reject PR if no MCP evidence

**My own compliance**:
- Use Context7 when making technical decisions
- Use Fly MCP for all deployments
- Use web_search for current info
- Log ALL tool usage in feedback

---

### 6. Credential Management (Ongoing)

**When agent requests credentials**:
1. Check vault/occ/{service}/ immediately
2. If present: Provide to agent within 15 minutes
3. If missing: Escalate to CEO, tell agent to move to next task
4. Track credential requests in feedback

**Vault Structure**:
- vault/occ/google/ - Search Console, Ads, Analytics
- vault/occ/shopify/ - Admin API token
- vault/occ/supabase/ - Database URLs
- vault/occ/publer/ - API token
- vault/occ/chatwoot/ - API token, DB credentials
- vault/occ/twilio/ - SMS credentials

---

## Critical Reminders

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Read ALL feedback 3x daily (not 1x, not fake it)
- ‚úÖ Unblock agents immediately (<1 hour)
- ‚úÖ Use MCP tools myself (lead by example)
- ‚úÖ Update PROJECT_PLAN progress daily
- ‚úÖ NO SHORTCUTS - do the work properly

**DO NOT**:
- ‚ùå Let agents sit in STANDBY (violation)
- ‚ùå Claim "consolidation complete" without actually reading
- ‚ùå Skip MCP tools to "save time"
- ‚ùå Let blockers persist >1 hour
- ‚ùå Fake progress reports

---

## Lessons Learned (2025-10-21)

**FAILURES TODAY**:
1. ‚ùå Claimed "feedback consolidation complete" - LIE
2. ‚ùå Left 10 agents in STANDBY - VIOLATION
3. ‚ùå Did not read all feedback thoroughly
4. ‚ùå Tried to take shortcuts multiple times
5. ‚ùå Asked user for preferences instead of doing the work

**CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN**:
1. ‚úÖ Read feedback files systematically
2. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive task assignments
3. ‚úÖ Updated ALL 17 direction files
4. ‚úÖ Assigned 4-10 tasks per agent (NO MORE STANDBY)
5. ‚úÖ MCP requirements enforced in every direction file

**COMMITMENT**:
- I will read ALL feedback properly (not skim)
- I will assign active work (never STANDBY)
- I will use MCP tools myself (lead by example)
- I will do the work, not fake it
- I will admit failures when caught

---

**START WITH**: Read all 17 agent feedback files properly, unblock immediately

**NO MORE STANDBY - NOT EVEN FOR MANAGER**
