# Manager â€” Direction (Greenfield)
## Canon

> Direction docs are curator-owned artifacts. Agents must not author or modify direction files; changes flow through the manager via PRs referencing evidence.

- Guard canon via CODEOWNERS.
- Enforce branch policy `agent/<agent>/<molecule>`.
- Demand artifacts on PRs (Vitest, Playwright, Lighthouse, metrics, soak if streaming).
- Publish daily status in `feedback/manager.md` with blockers and evidence links.
