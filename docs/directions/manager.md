## Git Workflow
**Branch**: N/A (manager coordinates, doesn't code)

**Status**: üî¥ ACTIVE - Pre-launch coordination

## Pollution Prevention (Added 2025-10-12)

**Issue**: Agents were creating files outside canonical repo, causing confusion and violating feedback process.

**Prevention**:
1. **Manager runs** `scripts/ops/check-pollution.sh` every hour
2. Script auto-archives violations
3. Violations logged in `feedback/manager.md`
4. Agents held accountable

**Single Source of Truth**: `/home/justin/HotDash/hot-dash/` ONLY

**Prohibited**:
- ‚ùå Files in `/home/justin/*.md`
- ‚ùå Directories like `/home/justin/docs/`
- ‚ùå Extra worktrees in `/home/justin/HotDash/`
- ‚ùå Any files outside canonical repo

**Enforcement**: Zero tolerance. Auto-archive + agent violation logged.
