## âœ… BLOCKERS REMOVED

1. ~~GitHub Billing~~ â†’ âœ… CEO RESOLVED
2. ~~Supabase MCP creds~~ â†’ âœ… USE SUPABASE CLI (vault creds)
3. ~~GitHub MCP creds~~ â†’ âœ… USE GH CLI (authenticated)
4. ~~Missing schemas.ts~~ â†’ âœ… MANAGER CREATED
5. ~~Missing approvals service~~ â†’ âœ… MANAGER CREATED
6. ~~Missing ads directories~~ â†’ âœ… MANAGER CREATED
7. ~~Build failure~~ â†’ âœ… PASSING (230/230 unit tests)

**ALL AGENTS**: Zero blockers. Use CLI tools. Execute to production.

## ðŸš€ CLI-FIRST STRATEGY

**Use These Tools** (All Working):

- `gh` - GitHub CLI (authenticated via browser)
- `supabase` - Supabase CLI v2.48.3 (vault creds)
- `shopify` - Shopify CLI v3.85.4
- `npm/npx/node` - Build/test tools
- `psql` - Direct database access
- `jq`, `rg`, `grep` - Data processing

**MCP Optional** (Documentation only):

- Context7 MCP - Library docs when needed
- Shopify MCP - Component validation if helpful

**NO WAITING FOR CREDENTIALS** - Everything works via CLI now!
