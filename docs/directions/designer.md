## ðŸš¨ P1 PRIORITY: SEO Pulse Tile UX Refinement (2025-10-13)

**Assignment**: Design visual hierarchy for SEO traffic anomaly monitoring
**Timeline**: 3 hours
**Evidence**: Log all work in feedback/designer.md
**Deadline**: 2025-10-15T18:00:00Z (48h)

### Context

**Current Problem** (from Engineer handoff):
- SEO Pulse tile shows ALL 100 landing pages from Google Analytics
- Every page shows "0.0% WoW" (Data team fixing this)
- No filtering or visual hierarchy
- CEO experiences information overload
- Unclear what requires action

**What's Working**:
- âœ… GA API integration functional
- âœ… Data retrieval successful
- âœ… Performance acceptable (<3s)

**What Needs Design**:
- Visual hierarchy to show only important anomalies
- Clear indicators for traffic trends (up/down/stable)
- Actionable information vs data dump
- Empty state for when no anomalies detected

### Dependencies

**WAIT FOR**: Product team anomaly threshold decisions
- Expected: 2025-10-14T18:00:00Z
- Need: Display count (top 5, 10, or all meeting threshold?)
- Need: Threshold percentage (20%, 30%?)
- Need: Show increases or only decreases?
- Check: feedback/product.md for spec

**START WHEN**: Product provides specification document

---

### Task D1: SEO Pulse Visual Hierarchy Design (3 hours)

**Requirements from Engineer**:

**Current Display** (needs fixing):
```
/ â€” 335 sessions (0.0% WoW)
/blogs/an-hose-101/ultimate-fuel-system-guide... â€” 177 sessions (0.0% WoW)
/pages/shop-all-hot-rod-an-llc-products... â€” 144 sessions (0.0% WoW)
... (97 more pages all identical format)
```

**Target Display** (your design):
```
Show only top 5-10 anomalies with visual indicators
Clear distinction between positive/negative trends
Empty state when no significant changes
```

**Design Specifications**:

**1. Anomaly Display Count**:
- Design for Product's recommendation (likely top 5-10)
- Consider: "View all" expansion pattern if needed
- Mobile: Show fewer items (3-5)
- Desktop: Can show more (5-10)

**2. Visual Indicators for Traffic Trends**:

**Significant Decrease (>20% drop)** - Requires attention:
- Color: Red (#DC2626 or brand equivalent)
- Icon: â¬‡ down arrow
- Typography: Bold for page path
- Highlight: Light red background or border

**Significant Increase (>20% gain)** - Positive:
- Color: Green (#16A34A or brand equivalent)  
- Icon: â¬† up arrow
- Typography: Regular weight
- Highlight: Light green background or border

**Stable (Â±20%)** - Neutral (maybe don't show?):
- Color: Gray (#6B7280)
- Icon: âž¡ horizontal arrow or none
- Typography: Regular weight

**3. Data Presentation**:
- Page path (truncate long URLs)
- Current sessions count
- WoW percentage (with + or - sign)
- Visual trend indicator (arrow + color)
- Sparkline chart (optional enhancement)

**4. Empty State Design**:
When no anomalies detected:
```
Icon: âœ“ or ðŸ“Š
Heading: "No significant traffic changes detected"
Subtext: "All landing pages performing within normal ranges"
Action: "View all pages" link (optional)
```

**5. Tile Header**:
- Title: "SEO Pulse" (keep consistent)
- Subtitle: "Top traffic anomalies" or similar
- Last updated timestamp
- Refresh indicator

**6. Mobile Responsiveness**:
- Stack items vertically on mobile
- Truncate page paths more aggressively
- Maintain color/icon indicators
- Reduce count (3-5 items max on mobile)

**7. Accessibility Requirements**:
- Color alone not sufficient (use icons + color)
- ARIA labels for trend indicators
- Screen reader announces: "Traffic down 25%"
- Keyboard navigation for "View all"
- Min contrast ratio 4.5:1

**Deliverables**:

**1. Figma Mockup** (1.5 hours):
- Desktop view (1280px+)
- Mobile view (375px)
- Empty state
- Various states (decreases, increases, mixed)
- Dark mode variant (if app supports)

**2. Component Specifications** (1 hour):
- Typography scale (path, sessions, percentage)
- Color palette (red, green, gray values)
- Spacing/padding (tile, items, gaps)
- Icon library reference
- Animation specs (if any)

**3. Design Handoff Document** (0.5 hours):
- Figma link
- Component breakdown for Engineer
- Edge cases documented:
  - Very long page paths
  - Extreme percentages (>1000%)
  - Zero traffic pages
  - Exactly at threshold
- Implementation notes
- QA testing scenarios

**Tools**:
- Figma (design mockups)
- Hot Rod AN brand guidelines (colors, typography)
- Reference: Current Shopify app design system

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… CEO can identify issues at a glance
- âœ… Visual distinction clear between good/bad trends
- âœ… Maximum 10 items by default
- âœ… Actionable information, not data dump
- âœ… Accessibility compliant
- âœ… Mobile responsive

**Evidence Required**:
- Figma link (make public or share with team)
- Design specs document
- Screenshot of key screens
- Timestamp

**Deadline**: 2025-10-15T18:00:00Z (after Product spec available)

- Git & Delivery Protocol: docs/git_protocol.md
- Direction Governance: docs/directions/README.md
- MCP Allowlist: docs/policies/mcp-allowlist.json
- Credential Map: docs/ops/credential_index.md
- Agent Launch Checklist (manager executed): docs/runbooks/agent_launch_checklist.md

> Manager authored. Request updates through manager with evidence; do not create independent direction docs.

## Local Execution Policy (Auto-Run)

You may run local, non-interactive commands (exports, scripts) without approval. Guardrails:

- Scope: local repo assets only; do not modify remote systems under auto-run.
- Non-interactive: avoid pagers and interactive editors; export assets to artifacts/collateral/.
- Evidence: log timestamp, command, outputs in feedback/designer.md.
- Secrets: never print values; reference names only.
- Retry: up to 2 attempts; then escalate with evidence.

- Deliver Polaris-aligned wireframes for dashboard + tile detail states by EOW; annotate approvals and toast flows.
- Define responsive breakpoints (min 1280px desktop, 768px tablet) and hand off tokens via Figma variables.
- Partner with engineer to map accessibility acceptance criteria (WCAG 2.2 AA) and focus order.
- Provide copy decks for tile summaries/action CTAs; keep copy English-only and coordinate updates with marketing.
- Attach evidence links (Figma share, accessibility audit) to feedback/manager.md daily.
- Review mock/live data states to ensure visual hierarchy holds when tiles error or show empty state.
- Stack guardrails: align visuals with `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` (React Router 7 shell, Supabase-backed data, Chatwoot on Supabase); remove references to deprecated stacks like Remix or Fly Postgres.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/designer.md` without waiting for additional manager confirmation.

## Current Sprint Focus â€” 2025-10-12
Own each deliverable through sign-off; post the artifacts (Figma links, screenshots, checklists) in `feedback/designer.md` as you finish them. If another team is needed, schedule the working session and follow it to completion rather than passing the task back.
