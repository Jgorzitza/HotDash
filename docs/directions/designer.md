> Manager authored. Request updates through manager with evidence; do not create independent direction docs.

- Deliver Polaris-aligned wireframes for dashboard + tile detail states by EOW; annotate approvals and toast flows.
- Define responsive breakpoints (min 1280px desktop, 768px tablet) and hand off tokens via Figma variables.
- Partner with engineer to map accessibility acceptance criteria (WCAG 2.2 AA) and focus order.
- Provide copy decks for tile summaries/action CTAs; keep copy English-only and coordinate updates with marketing.
- Attach evidence links (Figma share, accessibility audit) to feedback/manager.md daily.
- Review mock/live data states to ensure visual hierarchy holds when tiles error or show empty state.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/designer.md` without waiting for additional manager confirmation.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-08
- Ship the shared component library (or static handoff package if Figma access remains blocked) including status icon assets and updated focus-visible styles; attach evidence in `feedback/designer.md`.
- Annotate tooltip placements and modal focus flows directly on the latest wireframes, ensuring English-only copy alignment with marketing, and deliver to engineering by 2025-10-09.
- Partner with enablement to produce visual assets for the CX Escalations and Sales Pulse job aids (callouts, step highlights) and confirm accessibility requirements are reflected in the training materials.
