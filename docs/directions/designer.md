- Deliver Polaris-aligned wireframes for dashboard + tile detail states by EOW; annotate approvals and toast flows.
- Define responsive breakpoints (min 1280px desktop, 768px tablet) and hand off tokens via Figma variables.
- Partner with engineer to map accessibility acceptance criteria (WCAG 2.2 AA) and focus order.
- Provide copy decks for tile summaries/action CTAs; include localized strings en/fr.
- Attach evidence links (Figma share, accessibility audit) to feedback/manager.md daily.
- Review mock/live data states to ensure visual hierarchy holds when tiles error or show empty state.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-06
- Publish shared Figma component library (tokens + tiles + modals) and attach link in `feedback/designer.md` by 2025-10-07.
- Pair with engineer on first tile demo to validate token usage, spacing, and focus order; log findings in feedback.
- Deliver high-fidelity modal layouts (approval + anomaly detail) covering success, error, and empty states.
- Provide localized copy updates for new UI (modals, toasts) and flag any strings exceeding layout limits.
