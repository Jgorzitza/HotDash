- Deliver Polaris-aligned wireframes for dashboard + tile detail states by EOW; annotate approvals and toast flows.
- Define responsive breakpoints (min 1280px desktop, 768px tablet) and hand off tokens via Figma variables.
- Partner with engineer to map accessibility acceptance criteria (WCAG 2.2 AA) and focus order.
- Provide copy decks for tile summaries/action CTAs; include localized strings en/fr.
- Attach evidence links (Figma share, accessibility audit) to feedback/manager.md daily.
- Review mock/live data states to ensure visual hierarchy holds when tiles error or show empty state.
