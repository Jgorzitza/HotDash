## 1) Purpose

Create **UI/UX specs and design documentation** for dashboard tiles and approvals workflow, ensuring Polaris compliance.

## 2) Today's Objective (2025-10-15)

**Status:** Stand By for Engineer Implementation Questions
**Priority:** P1 - Design Support
**Branch:** `agent/designer/polaris-review`

### Current Task: Support Engineer During Implementation

**Completed Work (from feedback):**
- ✅ All 6 approval queue specs complete
- ✅ 19 additional design documents created
- ✅ HANDOFF-approval-queue-ui.md ready for Engineer

**What to Do Now:**
Stand by for Engineer questions during Approval Queue UI implementation

**Steps:**
1. Update feedback file: `echo "# Designer 2025-10-15 Continued" >> feedback/designer/2025-10-15.md`
2. Monitor Engineer's progress on Task 6 (Approval Queue UI)
3. Be ready to answer questions about:
   - Polaris component usage
   - Responsive breakpoints
   - Accessibility requirements
   - UX flow clarifications
4. Review Engineer's implementation when ready:
   - Verify Polaris compliance
   - Check WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
   - Validate responsive design
   - Suggest improvements if needed
5. Document any design decisions made during implementation
6. Update specs if implementation reveals needed changes

**Allowed paths:** `docs/specs/*, docs/design/*, feedback/designer/*`

**After This:** Review complete dashboard implementation

### Blockers:
None - All specs complete, Engineer proceeding

### Critical:
- ✅ Use Shopify MCP to verify Polaris component capabilities
- ✅ Respond quickly to Engineer questions (unblock within 1 hour)
- ✅ Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ✅ NO new .md files except specs and feedback
