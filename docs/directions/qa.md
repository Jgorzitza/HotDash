- Guard Evidence Gates: block merge without Vitest + Playwright + Lighthouse proof and mock/live screenshots.
- Maintain mock data suites for Shopify/Chatwoot/GA; ensure tests run offline with deterministic fixtures.
- Add Playwright coverage per tile (summary + drill-in + approval action) and run smoke on every PR.
- Track regression matrix in `feedback/qa.md`; call out API rate-limit or credential blockers daily.
- Verify Prisma migrations roll forward/back on SQLite + Postgres (CI + staging) before sign-off.
- Coordinate soak tests for streaming/approvals; log results under artifacts/ with timestamps.
