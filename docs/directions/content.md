## üìä MANDATORY: Progress Reporting (Database Feedback)

**Report progress via `logDecision()` every 2 hours minimum OR at task milestones.**

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { logDecision } from "~/services/decisions.server";

// When starting a task
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "content",
  taskId: "{TASK-ID}", // Task ID from this direction file
  status: "in_progress", // pending | in_progress | completed | blocked | cancelled
  progressPct: 0, // 0-100 percentage
  action: "task_started",
  rationale: "Starting {task description}",
  evidenceUrl: "docs/directions/content.md",
  durationEstimate: 4.0, // Estimated hours
});

// Progress update (every 2 hours)
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "content",
  taskId: "{TASK-ID}",
  status: "in_progress",
  progressPct: 50, // Update progress
  action: "task_progress",
  rationale: "Component implemented, writing tests",
  evidenceUrl: "artifacts/content/2025-10-22/{task}.md",
  durationActual: 2.0, // Hours spent so far
  nextAction: "Complete integration tests",
});

// When completed
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "content",
  taskId: "{TASK-ID}",
  status: "completed", // CRITICAL for manager queries
  progressPct: 100,
  action: "task_completed",
  rationale: "{Task name} complete, {X}/{X} tests passing",
  evidenceUrl: "artifacts/content/2025-10-22/{task}-complete.md",
  durationEstimate: 4.0,
  durationActual: 3.5, // Compare estimate vs actual
  nextAction: "Starting {NEXT-TASK-ID}",
});
```

### When Blocked (CRITICAL)

**Manager queries blocked tasks FIRST during consolidation**:

```typescript
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "content",
  taskId: "{TASK-ID}",
  status: "blocked", // Manager sees this in query-blocked-tasks.ts
  progressPct: 40,
  blockerDetails: "Waiting for {dependency} to complete",
  blockedBy: "{DEPENDENCY-TASK-ID}", // e.g., 'DATA-017', 'CREDENTIALS-GOOGLE-ADS'
  action: "task_blocked",
  rationale: "Cannot proceed because {reason}",
  evidenceUrl: "feedback/content/2025-10-22.md",
});
```

### Manager Visibility

Manager runs these scripts to see your work instantly:

- `query-blocked-tasks.ts` - Shows if you're blocked and why
- `query-agent-status.ts` - Shows your current task and progress
- `query-completed-today.ts` - Shows your completed work

**This is why structured logging is MANDATORY** - Manager can see status across all 17 agents in <10 seconds.

### Daily Shutdown (with Self-Grading)

**At end of day, log shutdown with self-assessment**:

```typescript
import { calculateSelfGradeAverage } from "~/services/decisions.server";

const grades = {
  progress: 5, // 1-5: Progress vs DoD
  evidence: 4, // 1-5: Evidence quality
  alignment: 5, // 1-5: Followed North Star/Rules
  toolDiscipline: 5, // 1-5: MCP-first, no guessing
  communication: 4, // 1-5: Clear updates, timely blockers
};

await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "content",
  action: "shutdown",
  status: "in_progress", // or 'completed' if all tasks done
  progressPct: 75, // Overall daily progress
  rationale: "Daily shutdown - {X} tasks completed, {Y} in progress",
  durationActual: 6.5, // Total hours today
  payload: {
    dailySummary: "{TASK-A} complete, {TASK-B} at 75%",
    selfGrade: {
      ...grades,
      average: calculateSelfGradeAverage(grades),
    },
    retrospective: {
      didWell: ["Used MCP first", "Good test coverage"],
      toChange: ["Ask questions earlier"],
      toStop: "Making assumptions",
    },
    tasksCompleted: ["{TASK-ID-A}", "{TASK-ID-B}"],
    hoursWorked: 6.5,
  },
});
```

### Markdown Backup (Optional)

You can still write to `feedback/content/2025-10-22.md` for detailed notes, but database is the primary method.

## üîß MANDATORY: DEV MEMORY

```typescript
import { logDecision } from "~/services/decisions.server";
await logDecision({
  scope: "build",
  actor: "content",
  action: "task_completed",
  rationale: "Task description with evidence",
  evidenceUrl: "artifacts/content/2025-10-21/task-complete.md",
});
```

Call at EVERY task completion. 100% DB protection active.
