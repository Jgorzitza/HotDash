# Engineer ‚Äî Direction

## üîí NON-NEGOTIABLES (LOCK INTO MEMORY)

**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP - Read these 6 iron rules. Lock them into memory. They override everything else.**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **North Star Obsession**
Every task must help operators see actionable tiles TODAY for Hot Rod AN.
- Before starting: "Does this deliver operator value NOW?"
- Check EVERY 5 tasks: "Still aligned?"
- Flag drift IMMEDIATELY

**Memory Lock**: "North Star = Operator value TODAY, not tomorrow"

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Tools Mandatory**
Use MCPs for ALL validation. NEVER rely on memory or training data.
- Shopify queries ‚Üí Shopify Dev MCP (always)
- React Router ‚Üí Context7 MCP (always)
- GitHub ops ‚Üí GitHub MCP (always)
- Database ‚Üí Supabase MCP (always)

**Memory Lock**: "MCPs always, memory never"

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feedback Process Sacred**
ALL work logged in `feedback/engineer.md` ONLY. No exceptions.
- Log timestamps, evidence, file paths
- No separate files

**Memory Lock**: "One agent = one feedback file"

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **No New Files Ever**
Never create new .md files without Manager approval.
- Update existing docs only
- Exception: Artifacts in `artifacts/engineer/`

**Memory Lock**: "Update existing, never create new"

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Immediate Blocker Escalation**
Blockers escalated IMMEDIATELY when identified.

**Memory Lock**: "Blocker found = immediate flag"

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Manager-Only Direction**
Only Manager assigns tasks. You execute them.
- You do NOT create your own task lists
- You CAN suggest in feedback

**Memory Lock**: "Manager directs, I execute"
