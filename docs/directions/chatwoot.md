# Chatwoot Integrations — Direction (Operator Control Center)
## Canon
- North Star: docs/NORTH_STAR.md
- Git & Delivery Protocol: docs/git_protocol.md
- Direction Governance: docs/directions/README.md
- MCP Allowlist: docs/policies/mcp-allowlist.json
- Credential Map: docs/ops/credential_index.md
- Agent Launch Checklist (manager executed): docs/runbooks/agent_launch_checklist.md

> Manager authored. This agent owns the Chatwoot Fly deployment end-to-end; do not pass work off until evidence proves completion.

## Local Execution Policy (Auto-Run)

You may run local, non-interactive commands and scripts without approval. Guardrails:

- Scope: local repo and local Supabase; under auto-run do not change Fly apps or secrets. Status/list checks are fine.
- Non-interactive: disable pagers; avoid interactive prompts.
- Evidence: log timestamp, command, outputs in feedback/chatwoot.md; artifacts under artifacts/integrations/ or artifacts/chatwoot/.
- Secrets: use vault/env; never print values.
- Tooling: npx supabase for local; git/gh with --no-pager; prefer rg else grep -nE.
- Retry: 2 attempts then escalate with logs.

- Execute all Chatwoot Fly tasks captured in `docs/deployment/chatwoot_fly_runbook.md` and the status artifact `artifacts/integrations/chatwoot-fly-deployment-2025-10-10.md`.
- Before touching Fly, source credentials locally (`source vault/occ/fly/api_token.env`) and confirm `FLY_API_TOKEN` is set via `/home/justin/.fly/bin/fly auth status` (and not the placeholder). Capture the confirmation in your feedback log.
- Coordinate directly with reliability/deployment for infrastructure needs but retain task ownership—log every update (including the command/output) in `feedback/chatwoot.md`.
- Ensure secrets, health checks, and evidence bundles are complete before handing off to support/QA.
- Stack guardrails: Chatwoot persists to Supabase only (see `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets`); do not provision Fly Postgres or alternate databases.
- Align Chatwoot automation with Shopify data sources: docs/dev/admin-graphql.md for admin facts, docs/dev/storefront-mcp.md for customer context.

**Options for You**:
1. ✅ **Continue with BL-CJ tasks** (recommended - keeps you productive)
2. ⏳ Wait for webhook notification (Engineer will notify in their feedback when deployed)

**When webhook deploys**: Return to Task 2, complete it, then continue with remaining tasks

**Manager Note**: Your velocity is exceptional. We'll keep providing deep backlogs to match your pace!

---

### 📋 EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT REMINDER (2025-10-11T22:40Z)

**QA validates all completed tasks - provide proof**:
- ✅ Config files: `app/config/chatwoot.ts:15-45 (webhook handlers defined)`
- ✅ Test results: `Tests pass (app/config/chatwoot.test.ts: 8 passing)`
- ✅ Documentation: `docs/chatwoot/webhooks.md (sections: setup, events, testing)`
- ✅ API testing: `Webhook test: curl logs in artifacts/chatwoot/webhook-test.log`

**NOT Acceptable**: "Webhook config done", "Integration complete", "Testing finished"

---

### ⚡ BLOCKER MANAGEMENT (2025-10-11T22:25Z)

**Known Dependencies** (DO NOT wait - work around):
- Task 2 (Webhook Config): Blocked by Engineer endpoint → SKIP to Task 3+, document requirements

**Your Strategy**: Execute all other tasks. For Task 2, create webhook spec document showing what you need from Engineer, then move on.
