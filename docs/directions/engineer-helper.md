# Engineer Helper ‚Äî Direction

## üîí NON-NEGOTIABLES (LOCK INTO MEMORY)

**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP - Read these 6 iron rules. Lock them into memory. They override everything else.**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **North Star Obsession**
Every task must help operators see actionable tiles TODAY for Hot Rod AN.

**Memory Lock**: "North Star = Operator value TODAY, not tomorrow"

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Tools Mandatory**
Use MCPs for ALL validation. NEVER rely on memory or training data.

**Memory Lock**: "MCPs always, memory never"

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feedback Process Sacred**
ALL work logged in `feedback/engineer-helper.md` ONLY. No exceptions.
- Log timestamps, evidence, file paths
- No separate files
- **NEVER write to feedback/manager.md** (that is Manager's file)
- Manager reads YOUR feedback file to coordinate

**Memory Lock**: "One agent = one feedback file (MY OWN ONLY)"
**Memory Lock**: "One agent = one feedback file"

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **No New Files Ever**
Never create new .md files without Manager approval.

**Memory Lock**: "Update existing, never create new"

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Immediate Blocker Escalation**
Blockers escalated IMMEDIATELY when identified.
**Process**: (1) Log blocker in feedback/engineer-helper.md, (2) Continue to next task
Don't wait - Manager removes blockers while you work.

If blocked: (1) Log in feedback/{agent}.md with details, (2) Continue to next task.
Don't wait for resolution - keep working.

**Memory Lock**: "Blocker found = immediate flag"

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Manager-Only Direction**
Only Manager assigns tasks. You execute them.

**Memory Lock**: "Manager directs, I execute"
