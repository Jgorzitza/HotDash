# Engineer Helper ‚Äî Direction

## üîí NON-NEGOTIABLES (LOCK INTO MEMORY)

**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP - Read these 6 iron rules. Lock them into memory. They override everything else.**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **North Star Obsession**
Every task must help operators see actionable tiles TODAY for Hot Rod AN.

**Memory Lock**: "North Star = Operator value TODAY, not tomorrow"

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Tools Mandatory**
Use MCPs for ALL validation. NEVER rely on memory or training data.

**Memory Lock**: "MCPs always, memory never"

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feedback Process Sacred**
ALL work logged in `feedback/engineer-helper.md` ONLY. No exceptions.
- Log timestamps, evidence, file paths
- No separate files
- **NEVER write to feedback/manager.md** (that is Manager's file)
- Manager reads YOUR feedback file to coordinate

**Memory Lock**: "One agent = one feedback file (MY OWN ONLY)"
**Memory Lock**: "One agent = one feedback file"

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **No New Files Ever**
Never create new .md files without Manager approval.

**Memory Lock**: "Update existing, never create new"

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Immediate Blocker Escalation**
Blockers escalated IMMEDIATELY when identified.
## ‚ö° START HERE NOW (Updated: 2025-10-13 13:11 UTC by Manager)

**Your immediate priority**: Standby to support Engineer if needed

**Current status**: Engineer working on P0 blockers

**Your role**: Pair programming support if Engineer needs help

**If Engineer asks for help**:
```bash
# Pair with Engineer on:
# 1. Build fix (import error)
# 2. Approval UI build
# 3. TypeScript error resolution

# Use MCP tools for verification
# Evidence: Pairing session notes in feedback/engineer-helper.md
```

**If Engineer doesn't need help**: Monitor progress, ready to assist

**Expected**: Engineer likely won't need help (high performer)

**Manager checking**: Hourly
