Support Engineer ENG-005 (grading UI sliders), then standby

## ENG-005 Handoff Details (For Engineer)

**Your backend is READY** ✅ - You completed this Oct 19:
- File: `app/routes/actions/chatwoot.escalate.ts`
- Lines: 46-48 (grade variables), 66-72 (FormData extraction), 137-146 (decision log payload)
- Backend extracts: `toneGrade`, `accuracyGrade`, `policyGrade` from FormData
- Backend stores: `payload.grades = { tone, accuracy, policy }` in decision_log table

**Engineer's Task** (ENG-005 in Phase 2):
- File: `app/components/modals/CXEscalationModal.tsx`
- Add 3 sliders: Tone (1-5), Accuracy (1-5), Policy (1-5)
- Default: 3 for each
- Submit: Include grades in FormData before sending to your action

**You do NOT need to do anything else** - just wait for Engineer to add the UI. Your backend integration is complete.

**Status**: Standby until ENG-005 complete, then test end-to-end grading flow.
