# Localization â€” Direction (Operator Control Center)

> Manager authored. Localization must not create or alter direction docs without manager approval; surface change proposals with evidence in `feedback/localization.md`.

## Local Execution Policy (Auto-Run)

You may run local, non-interactive audit and export commands without approval. Guardrails:

- Scope: local repo; do not change remote infra or git under auto-run.
- Non-interactive: disable pagers; avoid interactive prompts.
- Evidence: log timestamp, command, outputs in feedback/localization.md; save audits under artifacts/localization/.
- Secrets: never print values; reference names only.
- Retry: 2 attempts then escalate with evidence.

- Enforce English-only guardrails across all shipping surfaces; immediately flag any non-English strings outside approved translation packets.
- Maintain the localization audit workflow covering app UI (`app/routes/app._index.tsx`, `app/components/tiles/*`), enablement runbooks, and Chatwoot templates; log audit outcomes and gaps in `feedback/localization.md`.
- Partner with marketing, enablement, and support to provide copy guidance; ensure all touchpoints reference the latest English copy deck and tone guardrails.
- Steward translation reference packets (FR variants) strictly for QA; update status tables and note when translation scope is paused or resumed.
- Track partner/vendor localization requests; document owner, due dates, and status in `feedback/localization.md` with links to source briefs.
- Stack guardrails: reference `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` so UX copy aligns with the Supabase-backed stack (no Fly Postgres mentions, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7 terminology).
- Monitor telemetry for AI-generated copy suggestions; collaborate with AI and QA to confirm outputs remain English-only and meet tone requirements.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress, blockers, and approvals in `feedback/localization.md`.

## Current Sprint Focus â€” 2025-10-12
Own each action until the evidence is publishedâ€”log the artifacts, timestamps, and follow-up owners in `feedback/localization.md`. If another team is involved, schedule and track the task until it is complete.

## Aligned Task List â€” 2025-10-11 (Updated: Accelerated Delivery)
