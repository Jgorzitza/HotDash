# Localization â€” Direction (Operator Control Center)

> Manager authored. Localization must not create or alter direction docs without manager approval; surface change proposals with evidence in `feedback/localization.md`.

## Local Execution Policy (Auto-Run)

You may run local, non-interactive audit and export commands without approval. Guardrails:

- Scope: local repo; do not change remote infra or git under auto-run.
- Non-interactive: disable pagers; avoid interactive prompts.
- Evidence: log timestamp, command, outputs in feedback/localization.md; save audits under artifacts/localization/.
- Secrets: never print values; reference names only.
- Retry: 2 attempts then escalate with evidence.

- Enforce English-only guardrails across all shipping surfaces; immediately flag any non-English strings outside approved translation packets.
- Maintain the localization audit workflow covering app UI (`app/routes/app._index.tsx`, `app/components/tiles/*`), enablement runbooks, and Chatwoot templates; log audit outcomes and gaps in `feedback/localization.md`.
- Partner with marketing, enablement, and support to provide copy guidance; ensure all touchpoints reference the latest English copy deck and tone guardrails.
- Steward translation reference packets (FR variants) strictly for QA; update status tables and note when translation scope is paused or resumed.
- Track partner/vendor localization requests; document owner, due dates, and status in `feedback/localization.md` with links to source briefs.
- Stack guardrails: reference `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` so UX copy aligns with the Supabase-backed stack (no Fly Postgres mentions, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7 terminology).
- Monitor telemetry for AI-generated copy suggestions; collaborate with AI and QA to confirm outputs remain English-only and meet tone requirements.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress, blockers, and approvals in `feedback/localization.md`.

## Current Sprint Focus â€” 2025-10-12
Own each action until the evidence is publishedâ€”log the artifacts, timestamps, and follow-up owners in `feedback/localization.md`. If another team is involved, schedule and track the task until it is complete.

## ðŸš¨ LAUNCH CRITICAL REFOCUS (2025-10-11T22:50Z)

**CEO Decision**: Emergency refocus on launch gates

**Your Status**: PAUSED - Stand by until launch gates complete

**Why PAUSED**: Launch gates require Engineer, QA, Designer, Deployment work. Your tasks are valuable but not launch-blocking.

**When to Resume**: After all 7 launch gates complete (~48-72 hours)

**What to Do Now**: Stand by, review your completed work quality, ensure evidence is documented

**Your tasks remain in direction file - will resume after launch.**

---

## âœ… RESUME WORK (2025-10-11T23:20Z)

**Engineer Progress**: 5/7 launch gates complete! ðŸŽ‰

**Your Status**: Resume your paused tasks - no idle agents

**Rationale**: Engineer making excellent progress. While they finish last 2 gates, you can continue valuable post-launch work.

**Your Tasks**: Resume where you left off in your expanded task list

**Evidence**: Continue providing file paths, test results, documentation per QA standards

**Coordinate**: Support launch if needed, otherwise continue your strategic work

**Timeline**: Work until launch gates 100% complete, then shift to launch support/iteration
