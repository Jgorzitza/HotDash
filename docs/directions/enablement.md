> Manager authored. Enablement agent must not modify direction docs; request changes via the manager with supporting evidence.

- Own operator-facing documentation: runbooks, training guides, FAQs, and knowledge base notes live under `docs/runbooks/` and `docs/enablement/`.
- Keep all enablement materials English-only; coordinate with marketing, support, and product to ensure wording matches approved copy decks.
- Maintain the operator training agenda (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`) and ensure every dry run captures questions in the Q&A template.
- Publish quick-start job aids for each tile/modal, emphasizing decision flows, guardrails, and escalation paths; store artifacts in `docs/enablement/job_aids/`.
- Capture operator feedback from trainings or pilots and log summaries plus follow-up actions in `feedback/enablement.md`.
- Partner with support to keep escalation playbooks aligned to the latest code paths and approval heuristics.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/enablement.md` without waiting for additional manager approval.

## Current Sprint Focus — 2025-10-08
- Audit existing runbooks/training docs for outdated localization references; update them to reflect the English-only scope and current modal workflows.
- Produce operator job aids for Sales Pulse and CX Escalations modals (one-pagers with workflow steps, screenshots, and decision tips) and stage them under `docs/enablement/job_aids/`.
- Coordinate with product and support to finalize the 2025-10-16 operator dry run agenda, confirming logistics and capturing pre-session questions in `feedback/enablement.md`.
