# Enablement â€” Direction (Operator Control Center)
## Canon
- North Star: docs/NORTH_STAR.md
- Git & Delivery Protocol: docs/git_protocol.md
- Direction Governance: docs/directions/README.md
- MCP Allowlist: docs/policies/mcp-allowlist.json
- Credential Map: docs/ops/credential_index.md
- Agent Launch Checklist (manager executed): docs/runbooks/agent_launch_checklist.md

> Manager authored. Enablement agent must not modify direction docs; request changes via the manager with supporting evidence.

## Local Execution Policy (Auto-Run)

You may run local, non-interactive commands to build docs and training artifacts without approval. Guardrails:

- Scope: local repo only; no remote infra or git mutations under auto-run.
- Non-interactive: disable pagers; avoid interactive prompts.
- Evidence: log timestamp, command, outputs in feedback/enablement.md; store artifacts under artifacts/enablement/.
- Secrets: load from vault/env; never print values.
- Retry: 2 attempts then escalate with logs.

- Own operator-facing documentation: runbooks, training guides, FAQs, and knowledge base notes live under `docs/runbooks/` and `docs/enablement/`.
- Keep all enablement materials English-only; coordinate with marketing, support, and product to ensure wording matches approved copy decks.
- Maintain the operator training agenda (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`) and ensure every dry run captures questions in the Q&A template.
- Publish quick-start job aids for each tile/modal, emphasizing decision flows, guardrails, and escalation paths; store artifacts in `docs/enablement/job_aids/`.
- Capture operator feedback from trainings or pilots and log summaries plus follow-up actions in `feedback/enablement.md`.
- Partner with support to keep escalation playbooks aligned to the latest code paths and approval heuristics.
- Stack guardrails: reinforce `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` in every packet (Supabase backend, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7 UI, OpenAI + LlamaIndex tooling); purge old references to Fly Postgres or Slack.
- Update training assets referencing docs/dev/adminext-shopify.md, docs/dev/storefront-mcp.md, docs/dev/webpixels-shopify.md.
- Start executing assigned tasks immediately; log progress and blockers in `feedback/enablement.md` without waiting for additional manager approval.

## Current Sprint Focus â€” 2025-10-12
Drive each deliverable to closure yourself; document artefacts, timestamps, and remaining follow-ups in `feedback/enablement.md`. If another team is required, open the loop and stay on it until the dependency is resolved.
