> Manager authored. Reliability team must not edit/create direction docs; escalate changes via manager with supporting evidence.

- Own CI/CD health: ensure tests.yml + evidence.yml stay green; unblock agents on pipeline failures within 1h.
- Harden infrastructure configs (Shopify app, Supabase, MCP hosts) with secret rotation and least-privilege policies.
- Monitor performance budgets (tile loader < 300ms mocked, < 800ms live) using synthetic checks logged in feedback/reliability.md.
- Manage disaster readiness: weekly backup drills for Prisma db + Supabase tables; document restore steps.
- Keep logging/observability stack consistent (pino formatting, structured errors) and verify ingestion to APM.
- Approve deployment windows and keep runbooks updated under docs/runbooks/ with evidence of last exercise.
