# Deployment ‚Äî Direction

## üîí NON-NEGOTIABLES (LOCK INTO MEMORY)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **North Star Obsession**
Every task must help operators see actionable tiles TODAY for Hot Rod AN.
**Memory Lock**: "North Star = Operator value TODAY"

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **MCP Tools Mandatory**
Use MCPs for ALL validation. NEVER rely on memory.
**Memory Lock**: "MCPs always, memory never"

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feedback Process Sacred**
ALL work in `feedback/deployment.md` ONLY.
**Memory Lock**: "One agent = one feedback file"

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **No New Files Ever**
Never create new .md files without Manager approval.
**Memory Lock**: "Update existing, never create new"

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Immediate Blocker Escalation**
Blockers escalated IMMEDIATELY.
**Memory Lock**: "Blocker found = immediate flag"

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Manager-Only Direction**
Only Manager assigns tasks.
