# Operator Productivity Metrics: Measurement Methodology

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Owner**: Product Agent  
**Purpose**: Define measurement methodology for operator efficiency gains with HotDash

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines **how to measure operator productivity improvements** from HotDash adoption, ensuring we can prove ROI and quantify value delivered.

**Primary Metrics**:
1. **Time Saved** (hours/week): Manual process time vs HotDash-enabled time
2. **Tickets Processed** (tickets/hour): Throughput improvement
3. **Operator Satisfaction** (1-10 scale): Subjective experience

**Measurement Approach**: Before/after comparison using time tracking, self-reporting, and dashboard analytics.

**Target**: 50% improvement in productivity (8.2 tickets/hour → 12 tickets/hour) by Month 3.

---

## Part 1: Productivity Definition

### What is "Operator Productivity"?

**Productivity** = Value Output / Time Input

For HotDash operators (Hot Rodan CEO + team):
- **Value Output**: Tickets resolved, customers helped, orders fulfilled, business decisions made
- **Time Input**: Hours spent on operational tasks

**Productivity Improvement** = Do more in less time, or same amount in less time (freeing time for high-value work).

---

### Productivity vs Efficiency vs Effectiveness

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Productivity** | Output per unit time | 12 tickets/hour (vs 8 tickets/hour) |
| **Efficiency** | Time per task | 5 minutes/ticket (vs 8 minutes/ticket) |
| **Effectiveness** | Quality of output | 85% first-contact resolution (vs 64%) |

**Goal**: Improve all three with HotDash.

---

## Part 2: Productivity Metrics Framework

### Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)

#### Metric 1: Time Saved (Hours/Week)

**Definition**: Reduction in time spent on operational tasks per week.

**Baseline** (Manual Process):
- Hot Rodan CEO: 25 hours/week on ops
- Breakdown: 8 hrs inventory, 6 hrs support, 5 hrs fulfillment, 3 hrs reporting, 3 hrs vendor coordination

**Target** (With HotDash):
- Hot Rodan CEO: 13 hours/week on ops
- **Time Saved**: 12 hours/week (48% reduction)

**Measurement Method**:
- **Week 0 (Pre-Pilot)**: Ask CEO to log time spent on each task for 1 week (time diary)
- **Weeks 1-4 (During Pilot)**: CEO logs time saved daily in Slack ("Saved 2 hours today on inventory tracking")
- **Week 4 (Post-Pilot)**: CEO logs full week again, compare to Week 0

**Calculation**:
```
Time Saved = (Baseline Hours - HotDash Hours) / Baseline Hours × 100%
Example: (25 - 13) / 25 × 100% = 48% reduction
```

**Tools**:
- Time tracking app (Toggl, Harvest)
- Manual logging (CEO sends daily Slack message)
- Dashboard usage analytics (proxy for time spent)

---

#### Metric 2: Tickets Processed (Tickets/Hour)

**Definition**: Number of customer support tickets resolved per hour.

**Baseline** (Manual Process):
- Hot Rodan team: 8.2 tickets/hour (average across team)
- CEO alone: 6 tickets/hour (slower because of context switching)

**Target** (With HotDash):
- Hot Rodan team: 12 tickets/hour by Month 3
- CEO: 10 tickets/hour
- **Improvement**: +46%

**Measurement Method**:
- **Pre-Pilot**: Pull Chatwoot data (Sept 2025): Tickets resolved / hours worked
- **During Pilot**: Track tickets approved in approval queue + time spent
- **Post-Pilot**: Compare Month 1 vs baseline

**Calculation**:
```
Tickets/Hour = Tickets Resolved / Hours Worked
Example: 120 tickets / 10 hours = 12 tickets/hour
```

**Tools**:
- Chatwoot analytics (ticket resolution timestamps)
- HotDash approval queue logs (time per approval)

---

#### Metric 3: Operator Satisfaction (1-10 Scale)

**Definition**: Self-reported satisfaction with dashboard experience.

**Baseline** (Manual Process):
- Hot Rodan CEO: 6.8/10 (moderate satisfaction)
- Pain points: Repetitive tasks, context switching, time pressure

**Target** (With HotDash):
- Hot Rodan CEO: 8.8/10 by Month 6
- Drivers: Less burnout, more strategic work, faster resolutions

**Measurement Method**:
- **Weekly Survey** (5 questions, 2 minutes):
  1. How satisfied are you with HotDash this week? (1-10)
  2. How much time did HotDash save you this week? (hours)
  3. What worked well this week?
  4. What frustrated you this week?
  5. What feature would make this a 10/10 for you?

**Tools**:
- Google Forms (weekly email)
- Slack poll (quick weekly check-in)
- Quarterly deep-dive interview (30 min)

---

### Secondary Metrics (Track Monthly)

#### Metric 4: First-Contact Resolution Rate (FCR)

**Definition**: % of tickets resolved in first interaction (no follow-up needed).

**Baseline**: 64%  
**Target**: 85% by Month 6  
**Why It Matters**: Higher FCR = fewer repeat tickets = more time for new issues

**Measurement**: Chatwoot analytics (tickets not reopened within 7 days)

---

#### Metric 5: Average Resolution Time (Minutes/Ticket)

**Definition**: Time from ticket open to ticket resolved.

**Baseline**: 15.3 minutes  
**Target**: 8.0 minutes by Month 6  
**Why It Matters**: Faster resolution = happier customers + more tickets processed

**Measurement**: Chatwoot timestamps (ticket_resolved_at - ticket_created_at)

---

#### Metric 6: Context Switch Time (Minutes/Ticket)

**Definition**: Time spent switching between tools (Chatwoot, Shopify, email, etc.).

**Baseline**: 2.1 minutes/ticket (6 systems)  
**Target**: 0.5 minutes/ticket (1 system - HotDash)  
**Why It Matters**: Context switching is cognitive overhead, reduces flow state

**Measurement**: Self-reported in time diary + observation

---

#### Metric 7: High-Value Time (% of Shift)

**Definition**: % of work time spent on strategic/high-value activities vs repetitive tasks.

**Baseline**: 32% high-value (sales, strategy), 68% low-value (ops, reporting)  
**Target**: 65% high-value, 35% low-value  
**Why It Matters**: Operators should spend more time on meaningful work

**Measurement**: Weekly time diary categorization

---

## Part 3: Measurement Methodology

### Before/After Comparison (Baseline → Post-HotDash)

**Phase 1: Establish Baseline (Week 0, Pre-Pilot)**

**Data Collection**:
1. **Time Diary** (7 days): CEO logs all activities in 30-min blocks
   - Example: "9:00-9:30: Check inventory spreadsheet"
   - Categorize: High-value vs Low-value, Strategic vs Tactical
2. **Chatwoot Export** (Sept 2025 data): Ticket volume, resolution time, FCR
3. **Survey** (pre-pilot): Current satisfaction, pain points, wishlist

**Baseline Report**:
- Time on ops: 25 hrs/week
- Tickets/hour: 6
- Resolution time: 15.3 min
- FCR: 64%
- Satisfaction: 6.8/10

---

**Phase 2: Weekly Tracking (Weeks 1-4, During Pilot)**

**Data Collection**:
1. **Daily Slack Log**: CEO posts time saved daily
   - Example: "Saved 1.5 hours today—inventory alerts caught low stock early"
2. **Dashboard Analytics**: Usage logs (logins, tile views, approvals)
3. **Weekly Survey**: 5 questions, 2 minutes
4. **Weekly Check-In Call**: Qualitative feedback

**Weekly Report**:
- Time saved this week: X hours
- Tickets processed: Y tickets
- Satisfaction: Z/10
- Top wins: [list]
- Top issues: [list]

---

**Phase 3: Post-Pilot Comparison (Week 5)**

**Data Collection**:
1. **Time Diary** (7 days): CEO logs full week again
2. **Chatwoot Export** (Oct 2025 data): Compare to Sept baseline
3. **Survey** (post-pilot): Final satisfaction, ROI perceived, renewal intent

**Post-Pilot Report**:
- Time on ops: 13 hrs/week (vs 25 baseline) → **48% reduction**
- Tickets/hour: 10 (vs 6 baseline) → **67% improvement**
- Resolution time: 10 min (vs 15.3) → **35% faster**
- FCR: 78% (vs 64%) → **+14pp improvement**
- Satisfaction: 9/10 (vs 6.8) → **+2.2 points**

**ROI Calculation**:
- Time saved: 12 hrs/week × 48 weeks = 576 hours/year
- Value of time: 576 × $1,500/hr = $864K/year potential
- HotDash cost: $2,400/year
- **ROI: 35,900%** (or 359x return)

### Control Group (Optional, If Multiple Operators)

**Scenario**: If Hot Rodan has 3 operators, use 1 as control group.

**Setup**:
- **Treatment Group**: 2 operators use HotDash
- **Control Group**: 1 operator uses manual process
- **Duration**: 4 weeks

**Comparison**:
| Metric | Treatment (HotDash) | Control (Manual) | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Tickets/hour | 10 | 6 | +67% |
| Resolution time | 10 min | 15 min | -33% |
| Satisfaction | 9/10 | 7/10 | +2 points |

**Conclusion**: HotDash group significantly outperforms control group.

**Note**: Only use control group if ethical (doesn't disadvantage anyone) and large enough sample size.

---

## Part 5: ROI Calculation Methodology

### Step 1: Calculate Time Saved

**Baseline Time on Ops**: 25 hours/week  
**HotDash Time on Ops**: 13 hours/week  
**Time Saved**: 12 hours/week

---

### Step 2: Assign Hourly Value

**CEO Hourly Value**: $1,500/hour (based on salary + opportunity cost)

**Justification**:
- Hot Rodan revenue: $1.2MM/year
- CEO time: 2,000 hours/year
- Revenue per hour: $1.2MM / 2,000 = $600/hour (conservative)
- But CEO time on revenue = 2.5x multiplier (high-leverage activities)
- **Effective value**: $600 × 2.5 = $1,500/hour

---

### Step 3: Calculate Annual Value

**Annual Time Saved**: 12 hours/week × 48 weeks = 576 hours/year

**Annual Value**: 576 hours × $1,500/hour = **$864,000/year**

---

### Step 4: Subtract HotDash Cost

**HotDash Cost**: $2,400/year ($200/month pilot pricing)

**Net Value**: $864,000 - $2,400 = **$861,600/year**

---

### Step 5: Calculate ROI

**ROI Formula**: (Gain - Cost) / Cost × 100%

**ROI**: ($861,600) / $2,400 × 100% = **35,900%**

Or more conservatively (realized revenue impact): ($500K - $2,400) / $2,400 = **20,733%**
