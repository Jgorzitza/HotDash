## Top 15 Risks (Prioritized)

### Risk #1: Operator Resistance (CEO Doesn't Adopt Dashboard)

**Category**: Customer Risk  
**Likelihood**: Medium (40%)  
**Impact**: Critical (pilot fails)  
**Risk Score**: HIGH PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Hot Rodan CEO logs into dashboard Week 1, finds it confusing or not valuable, stops using it by Week 2.

**Warning Signs**:
- CEO hasn't logged in for 2+ consecutive days
- CEO using "too busy" excuse
- CEO feedback is vague ("it's fine") vs specific
- CEO reverts to old tools (manual spreadsheets, email)

**Root Causes**:
- Dashboard doesn't match CEO's mental model
- Learning curve too steep
- Value not immediately obvious
- CEO distracted by other priorities

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Week 1 Hand-Holding**: Daily Slack check-ins ("How's it going today?")
2. **Quick Wins**: Ship "Export to CSV" in Week 1 (instant value)
3. **Personalization**: Customize tiles to CEO's top 3 priorities
4. **Time Tracking**: Ask CEO to log time saved daily (makes value visible)
5. **Habit Building**: Suggest "Morning Routine" (check dashboard first thing)

**Contingency Plan (If CEO Not Adopting by Week 2)**:
- Schedule 30-min Zoom call to diagnose issue
- Offer to customize dashboard to CEO's workflow
- Ask: "What would make this your go-to tool?"
- If still not adopting: Extend pilot 2 weeks free, iterate based on feedback

**Owner**: Product Agent (monitor daily, intervene fast)

---

### Risk #2: Technical Failures (Bugs, Downtime, Data Loss)

**Category**: Product Risk  
**Likelihood**: Medium (30%)  
**Impact**: Critical (trust destroyed)  
**Risk Score**: HIGH PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Dashboard crashes during CEO's morning routine, or shows incorrect sales data, or loses inventory alerts.

**Warning Signs**:
- Error rate >1% in logs
- CEO reports "dashboard not loading"
- Data discrepancies (Shopify shows $10K, dashboard shows $8K)
- Slow load times (>5 seconds)

**Root Causes**:
- Untested edge cases
- Shopify API rate limiting
- Database connection issues
- Browser compatibility bugs

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Pre-Launch Testing**: QA test all tiles with Hot Rodan's Shopify data
2. **Health Monitoring**: Set up alerts (Sentry, Fly.io monitoring)
3. **Fast Response SLA**: Critical bugs fixed <2 hours, minor bugs <24 hours
4. **Graceful Degradation**: If Shopify API fails, show cached data + warning
5. **Daily Health Check**: Engineer checks dashboard health every morning

**Contingency Plan (If Critical Bug Occurs)**:
- **<5 min**: Acknowledge bug in Slack ("We're investigating X, will fix ASAP")
- **<2 hours**: Deploy fix to production
- **<4 hours**: Follow-up in Slack ("Fixed! Can you confirm it's working now?")
- **If unfixable same-day**: Provide manual workaround, refund that day's cost

**Owner**: Engineer (fix bugs), Product Agent (communicate to CEO)

---

### Risk #3: Value Not Realized (Time Savings <10 hrs/week)

**Category**: Business Risk  
**Likelihood**: Medium (30%)  
**Impact**: High (renewal at risk)  
**Risk Score**: HIGH PRIORITY

**Scenario**: CEO uses dashboard but still spends 20 hours/week on ops (not 13 hours), saves only 5 hours/week.

**Warning Signs**:
- Week 2 check-in: CEO says "It's helpful but not life-changing"
- Time tracking shows <6 hours saved by Week 2
- CEO still using old tools (manual processes not replaced)

**Root Causes**:
- Dashboard missing critical features CEO needs
- CEO workflow doesn't match our assumptions
- AI approval queue not accurate enough (high rejection rate)
- Time saved is real but CEO doesn't notice ("invisible" improvements)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Time Tracking**: Ask CEO to log time saved per feature weekly
2. **Workflow Audit**: Watch CEO use dashboard (screen recording), identify gaps
3. **Feature Prioritization**: Ship CEO's #1 requested feature by Week 3
4. **ROI Calculation**: Show dollar value ($1,500/hr × 10 hrs = $15K/week saved)
5. **Before/After Comparison**: Document CEO's manual process vs dashboard process

**Contingency Plan (If Time Savings <10 hrs by Week 3)**:
- Deep dive call (60 min): "Let's figure out where time is going"
- Identify top 3 time sinks CEO still has
- Commit to shipping custom feature if needed
- Extend pilot 2 weeks free to prove value
- If still <10 hrs by Week 5: Pause pilot, fix product before next customer

**Owner**: Product Agent (diagnose issue, prioritize fixes)

---

### Risk #4: Competitor Moves In (Hot Rodan Sees Better Alternative)

**Category**: Competitive Risk  
**Likelihood**: Low (15%)  
**Impact**: High (lose customer)  
**Risk Score**: MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Gorgias, Zendesk, or new competitor offers free trial to Hot Rodan mid-pilot.

**Warning Signs**:
- CEO mentions "I saw this other tool..."
- CEO asks "How are you different from X?"
- CEO delayed in responding to check-in calls

**Root Causes**:
- Competitor outbound sales targets hot rod shops
- CEO networking with peers who use competitor
- CEO dissatisfied with HotDash, actively shopping

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Lock-In**: Build habit early (morning routine = HotDash check)
2. **Differentiation**: Emphasize "built for hot rod shops" (not generic)
3. **Switching Cost**: Integrate deeply (Shopify, QuickBooks, email)
4. **Relationship**: Weekly calls build personal connection
5. **Testimonials**: Share other customer success stories (social proof)

**Contingency Plan (If CEO Mentions Competitor)**:
- Ask: "What features do they have that we don't?"
- Competitive comparison: Show why HotDash is better (operator-first, vertical)
- Offer custom feature if competitor has something we lack
- Price match if competitor cheaper (but emphasize value difference)

**Owner**: Product Agent (competitive intelligence, differentiation)

---

### Risk #5: CEO Priorities Shift (No Longer Focused on Dashboard)

**Category**: Customer Risk  
**Likelihood**: Medium (25%)  
**Impact**: Medium (pilot delayed, not failed)  
**Risk Score**: MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Hot Rodan CEO gets distracted by urgent issue (vendor problem, big customer complaint, family emergency).

**Warning Signs**:
- CEO cancels/reschedules check-in calls
- CEO hasn't logged in for 3+ days
- CEO mentions "busy with X right now"

**Root Causes**:
- External crisis takes priority
- CEO time management issues
- Dashboard not integrated into daily routine yet

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Empathy**: Acknowledge CEO is busy, offer to pause pilot if needed
2. **Low-Touch**: Reduce check-in frequency (bi-weekly vs weekly)
3. **Async Updates**: Send Slack summaries vs calls
4. **Delegation**: Offer to train Ops Manager to use dashboard instead
5. **Reminder**: Weekly Slack nudge ("Quick reminder: check your low stock alerts")

**Contingency Plan (If CEO Disengaged for 2+ Weeks)**:
- Slack message: "Should we pause the pilot until you're less busy?"
- Offer to extend pilot timeline (4 weeks → 6 weeks, same cost)
- Delegate to Ops Manager or Support Lead if available
- If still disengaged after 4 weeks: Gracefully pause pilot, reconnect in 2 months

**Owner**: Product Agent (flexible, accommodating)

---

### Risk #6: AI Approval Queue Not Accurate (High Rejection Rate)

**Category**: Product Risk  
**Likelihood**: Medium (35%)  
**Impact**: Medium (reduces time savings)  
**Risk Score**: MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Scenario**: AI drafts poor responses, CEO rejects 50%+ of drafts, defeats purpose of approval queue.

**Warning Signs**:
- Rejection rate >20% in Week 1
- CEO feedback: "AI doesn't understand my customers"
- Edit rate >60% (CEO rewrites most drafts)

**Root Causes**:
- Training data not hot rod-specific
- AI doesn't understand industry jargon ("chrome headers", "camshaft")
- Tone mismatch (too formal or too casual)
- Knowledge base gaps

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Hot Rod Vocabulary**: Train AI on hot rod terminology
2. **Tone Calibration**: Learn Hot Rodan CEO's tone from edited drafts
3. **Knowledge Base Audit**: Fill gaps in Week 1 (shipping policy, return policy)
4. **Confidence Threshold**: Only show drafts with ≥80% confidence
5. **Learning Loop**: AI improves weekly from CEO edits

**Contingency Plan (If Rejection Rate >30% in Week 2)**:
- Pause AI drafts, switch to "AI suggests relevant KB articles" only
- Manual analysis: Review 10 rejected drafts, identify patterns
- Prompt engineering: Adjust AI prompts based on patterns
- Re-enable AI drafts in Week 3 after improvements
- If still >20% rejection by Week 4: Make AI-assisted search priority over drafts

**Owner**: Engineer (AI tuning), Product Agent (monitor rejection rate)

---

### Risk #7: Knowledge Base Gaps (AI Can't Find Answers)

**Category**: Product Risk  
**Likelihood**: High (60%)  
**Impact**: Medium (reduces AI accuracy)  
**Risk Score**: MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Scenario**: AI searches knowledge base, finds no relevant articles for 30%+ of customer questions.

**Warning Signs**:
- AI confidence score <70% for many drafts
- CEO says "AI doesn't know our policies"
- Support tickets repeat same questions (gap in KB)

**Root Causes**:
- Knowledge base not populated yet (startup problem)
- Hot rod-specific FAQs missing
- Policies not documented
- Seasonal/niche topics not covered

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Pre-Pilot KB Audit**: Identify top 20 customer questions, create articles
2. **Week 1 Gap Analysis**: Track queries with no KB match, prioritize articles
3. **CEO as Expert**: Ask CEO to write/approve 5 articles per week
4. **Learning from Tickets**: Auto-generate draft articles from support tickets
5. **Coverage Goal**: ≥85% of customer questions have relevant article by Week 4

**Contingency Plan (If KB Coverage <70% in Week 2)**:
- Dedicated "KB Sprint": Product Agent + CEO create 20 articles in 1 day
- Import existing docs: Shipping policy, return policy, FAQ from website
- Templated articles: Use Hot Rodan's existing email responses as basis
- If still <70% by Week 3: Reduce AI drafts, focus on KB search first

**Owner**: Product Agent (KB management), CEO (content expert)

### Risk #8: Pricing Objection at Renewal (CEO Balks at $400/month)

**Category**: Business Risk  
**Likelihood**: Low (20%)  
**Impact**: Medium (lose customer or reduce price)  
**Risk Score**: LOW PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Week 4 renewal conversation, CEO says "$400/month is too expensive."

**Warning Signs**:
- CEO asks "Can I get a discount?" in Week 2-3
- CEO mentions "I need to check my budget"
- CEO compares to free alternatives (Shopify, Google Sheets)

**Root Causes**:
- ROI not clear to CEO
- CEO financially constrained
- CEO doesn't see enough value yet
- Sticker shock ($200 pilot → $400 standard)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **ROI Communication**: Weekly reminders of time saved ($1,500/hr × 10 hrs = $15K/week)
2. **Anchor Pricing**: Compare to Ops Manager ($80K/year) not Netflix ($15/month)
3. **Pilot Discount**: Offer $300/month Year 1 (25% off) for early customers
4. **Payment Plan**: Offer annual payment (2 months free) to reduce monthly cost perception
5. **Value Reinforcement**: Share testimonials from other customers

**Contingency Plan (If CEO Objects to Pricing)**:
- Offer $300/month Year 1 (lowest we can go)
- Annual payment: $3,600/year ($300/month equivalent)
- Guarantee: If CEO doesn't save ≥10 hours/week by Month 3, refund 50%
- Feature negotiation: "What feature would make $400/month worth it?"
- If CEO still declines: Extend pilot at $200/month, prove more value

**Owner**: Product Agent (pricing negotiation, ROI communication)

---

### Risk #9: Shopify API Changes (Break Integration)

**Category**: Product Risk  
**Likelihood**: Low (10%)  
**Impact**: High (dashboard stops working)  
**Risk Score**: MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Shopify updates API, breaks HotDash integration, sales data stops syncing.

**Warning Signs**:
- Shopify deprecation notice (email to devs)
- Data sync lag (last updated 2 hours ago vs real-time)
- Error logs show API authentication failures

**Root Causes**:
- Shopify API versioning
- API rate limiting
- Authentication token expiration
- Webhook configuration changes

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **API Monitoring**: Daily health check (Shopify connection status)
2. **Version Pinning**: Use stable Shopify API version (not latest)
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Cache data, show warning if sync fails
4. **Shopify Docs**: Subscribe to Shopify developer changelog
5. **Redundancy**: Multiple API endpoints (REST + GraphQL)

**Contingency Plan (If Shopify Integration Breaks)**:
- **<1 hour**: Notify CEO ("We're aware of Shopify sync issue, fixing now")
- **<4 hours**: Deploy fix (switch to backup API or update auth)
- **If unfixable same-day**: Provide manual CSV import workaround
- **<24 hours**: Full resolution and post-mortem

**Owner**: Engineer (API maintenance), Product Agent (CEO communication)

### Risk #10: Hot Rodan Goes Out of Business (Customer Closes)

**Category**: Customer Risk  
**Likelihood**: Very Low (<5%)  
**Impact**: Critical (lose pilot customer + case study)  
**Risk Score**: LOW PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Hot Rodan faces financial crisis, closes shop, pilot aborted.

**Warning Signs**:

- CEO mentions "cash flow issues"
- CEO cuts expenses (lays off staff)

**Root Causes**:
- Economic downturn
- Major customer churns

2. **Empathy**: Offer to pause/reduce pricing if CEO struggling
3. **Value Focus**: Emphasize cost savings (avoid hiring, reduce waste)
4. **Flexible Terms**: Month-to-month (no long-term commitment)

**Contingency Plan (If Hot Rodan in Financial Trouble)**:
- Offer free pilot extension (3 months) if CEO commits to testimonial later
- Emphasize ROI: "HotDash saves you $18K/week, costs $400/month"
- If closure imminent: Gracefully exit, maintain relationship for future
- Document learnings: Why did customer fail? (not our fault, but learn)

**Owner**: Product Agent (relationship management)

---

### Risk #11: Feature Request Overload (Can't Ship Everything)

**Category**: Operational Risk  
**Likelihood**: Medium (40%)  
**Impact**: Low (expectations mismatch)  
**Risk Score**: LOW PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Hot Rodan CEO requests 20 features, we can only ship 5, CEO disappointed.

**Warning Signs**:
- CEO lists 10+ feature requests in Week 1
- CEO asks "When will X be ready?" multiple times
- CEO compares to competitor features

**Root Causes**:
- CEO has big vision, wants everything now
- Misaligned expectations (pilot vs full product)
- CEO doesn't understand development timelines

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Expectations Setting**: "We'll ship 1-2 features per week during pilot"
2. **Prioritization Transparency**: Share RICE scores, explain why X before Y
3. **Quick Wins First**: Ship easy features Week 1-2 (Export to CSV, keyboard shortcuts)
4. **Roadmap Sharing**: Show 12-month plan, CEO sees future features coming
5. **Say No Gracefully**: "Great idea! Let's add to Q2 roadmap after pilot"

**Contingency Plan (If CEO Frustrated by Pace)**:
- Prioritization call: "Let's pick your top 3 must-haves for pilot"
- Custom feature offer: "We'll build 1 custom feature for you in Week 3"
- Post-pilot commitment: "After pilot, we'll focus on your top requests"
- If CEO still frustrated: Extend pilot, ship more features before renewal decision

**Owner**: Product Agent (expectation management, prioritization)

- Resume check-in calls when CEO returns

**Owner**: Product Agent (flexible scheduling)

---

### Risk #13: Hot Rodan Team Turnover (Key Operator Leaves)

**Category**: Customer Risk

**Scenario**: Hot Rodan Ops Manager quits mid-pilot, CEO distracted.

**Warning Signs**:
- CEO mentions "hiring challenges"
- New faces in check-in calls
- Dashboard usage drops

**Root Causes**:
- Employee quits
- Employee fired
- Temporary leave (medical, family)

**Owner**: Product Agent (onboarding support)

---

### Risk #14: Negative Word-of-Mouth (Hot Rodan Tells Peers to Avoid Us)

**Category**: Business Risk  
**Likelihood**: Very Low (<5%)  
**Impact**: Critical (reputation damage, lose vertical)  
**Risk Score**: LOW PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Hot Rodan CEO has bad experience, posts negative review in hot rod forums or tells peers not to use HotDash.

**Warning Signs**:
- CEO rating <6/10 in Week 4
- CEO angry/frustrated (not just disappointed)
- CEO mentions "I'm going to tell others not to use this"

**Root Causes**:
- Major product failure (data loss, security breach)
- Poor customer service (unresponsive, dismissive)
- Promises not kept ("You said X would be ready Week 2")
- Pricing bait-and-switch ("Pilot was $200, now $500?")

- 1-on-1 call with CEO: "What went wrong? How can we make it right?"
- Offer full refund + free month (appeasement)
- If CEO still angry: Request private feedback (not public review)
- Damage control: Ask what we can do to prevent negative word-of-mouth
- Post-mortem: Document what failed, fix before next customer

**Owner**: Manager Agent (escalation), Product Agent (relationship repair)

---

### Risk #15: Pilot Success But Can't Replicate (Hot Rodan is Unicorn)

**Category**: Business Risk  
**Likelihood**: Low (20%)  
**Impact**: Medium (slows scale-up)  
**Risk Score**: LOW PRIORITY

**Scenario**: Hot Rodan pilot succeeds (9/10 rating), but next 3 customers fail (they're different).

**Warning Signs**:
- Next customers have lower revenue (<$500K)
- Next customers use different tools (not Shopify)
- Next customers have different workflows

**Root Causes**:
- Hot Rodan was uniquely good fit
- Hot Rodan CEO unusually tech-savvy
- Hot Rodan workflows don't generalize
- Product-market fit not proven yet

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Customer Selection**: Pick next 3 customers similar to Hot Rodan (revenue, Shopify, workflows)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Document what made Hot Rodan successful
3. **Qualification**: Screen next customers carefully (are they like Hot Rodan?)
4. **Iteration**: Adjust product based on differences in next customers
5. **Sample Size**: Don't conclude after 1 customer—need 5+ to validate

**Contingency Plan (If Next Customers Don't Succeed Like Hot Rodan)**:
- Deep dive: What's different? (customer, product, our execution?)
- Hypothesis: "Hot Rodan worked because X, next customers lack X"
- Product changes: Add features that make product work for wider audience
- Slow down scale-up: Prove product-market fit with 5 customers before scaling to 20
- Pivot: If product doesn't work for hot rod shops broadly, focus on different vertical

**Owner**: Product Agent (pattern recognition, customer selection)
