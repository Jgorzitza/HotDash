## Part 3: Pilot-to-Paid Conversion Strategy

### Renewal Conversation (Week 4)

**Timing**: Friday Nov 8 (Week 4 check-in call)

**Script**:
> "You've been using HotDash for 4 weeks now. Based on your feedback, you're saving 12 hours/week and rated the dashboard 9/10. We'd love to continue working with you beyond the pilot.
>
> Our standard pricing is $400/month. For pilot customers like you, we're offering $300/month for Year 1 (25% discount) as a thank you for your feedback and willingness to be an early adopter.
>
> Sound good?"

**Objection Handling**:
- **"That's more than $200/month pilot"**: True, but you're now saving 12 hours/week ($1,800/week value). $300/month is <2% of value delivered.
- **"I need to think about it"**: Understood. Can I ask‚Äîis this a budget concern, or something about the product?
- **"Can I get a better price?"**: I can offer $300/month for Year 1, locked in (no price increases). That's the best I can do for early customers.

**Close**:
- If YES ‚Üí Send contract (monthly billing, 30-day cancellation)
- If MAYBE ‚Üí Extend pilot 2 weeks at $200/month, revisit
- If NO ‚Üí Ask why (feedback for product improvements)

---

### Testimonial Request (Week 4)

**Timing**: After renewal commitment

**Request**:
> "We'd love to share your Hot Rodan success story with other hot rod shops. Would you be willing to provide a short testimonial (3-4 sentences) about your experience with HotDash?
>
> Something like: What problem did HotDash solve? How much time did you save? Would you recommend it to other hot rod shop owners?"

**Format Options**:
1. **Written Testimonial**: Email 3-4 sentences + headshot
2. **Video Testimonial**: 1-minute Loom video (we'll edit)
3. **Case Study Interview**: 30-minute Zoom call (we'll write case study)

**Incentive**: Offer free month ($300 value) for video testimonial or case study participation

---

## Part 4: Scale-Up Strategy (Next 3-5 Customers)

### Customer Selection Criteria

**Ideal Next Customer** (similar to Hot Rodan):
- ‚úÖ Hot rod shop or performance parts business
- ‚úÖ $500K-$5MM annual revenue
- ‚úÖ Shopify-based e-commerce
- ‚úÖ CEO wears multiple hats (ops + sales + support)
- ‚úÖ 1-5 employees (small team)
- ‚úÖ Growth-oriented (wants to scale to $10MM)

**Red Flags** (avoid these customers for now):
- ‚ùå Generic Shopify store (not automotive-specific)
- ‚ùå <$500K revenue (too small, can't afford $400/month)
- ‚ùå >$10MM revenue (need enterprise features we don't have yet)
- ‚ùå Complex ops (multiple warehouses, international shipping)
- ‚ùå Not using Shopify (integration challenges)

---

### Pilot Replication Playbook (Week-by-Week)

**Pre-Pilot (Week 0)**:
1. Qualification call (30 min): Confirm fit, set expectations
2. Send pilot agreement: $200-$300/month for 4 weeks, feedback expected
3. Onboarding prep: Create Slack channel, collect Shopify credentials
4. Kickoff scheduling: Week 1 Monday 9:00 AM

**Pilot Execution (Weeks 1-4)**:
- Use same weekly structure as Hot Rodan pilot
- Daily Slack monitoring
- Weekly 30-min check-in calls
- Fix bugs within 2-4 hours (critical), 24 hours (minor)

**Post-Pilot (Week 5)**:
- Renewal conversation (target: $300-$400/month)
- Testimonial request (if rating ‚â•8/10)
- Case study interview (if willing)
- Referral request ("Who else in the hot rod community would benefit?")

---

### Scaling to 3-5 Customers (Nov-Dec 2025)

**Goal**: 5 paying customers by Jan 2026

**Customer Acquisition Plan**:
1. **Hot Rodan Referrals** (2 customers): Ask Hot Rodan CEO for introductions
2. **Hot Rod Forums** (1-2 customers): Post in online communities (with permission)
3. **Car Shows** (1 customer): Attend local car show, demo dashboard at booth

**Capacity Management**:
- 1 Product Agent can support 5 pilot customers simultaneously
- Weekly check-in calls: 5 customers √ó 30 min = 2.5 hours/week
- Bug fixes: Budget 10 hours/week for fixes + iterations

---

### Scaling to 10-20 Customers (Jan-Mar 2026)

**Goal**: 20 customers by Mar 2026 ($8K MRR)

**Customer Acquisition Channels**:
1. **Referrals** (50%): 10 customers from existing customer network
2. **Content Marketing** (30%): Blog posts, case studies, SEO
3. **Paid Ads** (20%): Facebook/Instagram ads targeting hot rod shops

**Onboarding Automation**:
- Self-serve onboarding (video tutorials, docs)
- Reduce kickoff calls to 15 minutes (not 30)
- Weekly check-ins become bi-weekly after Month 1

---

## Part 5: Lessons from Hot Rodan Pilot

### What Worked Well (Replicate This)

1. **Weekly Check-In Calls**: Build trust, gather feedback, show we care
2. **Fast Bug Fixes** (<2 hours): Demonstrates commitment, builds confidence
3. **Quick Wins** (Week 2): Early value (Export to CSV) keeps CEO engaged
4. **Operator-First Language**: Avoid jargon, speak CEO's language
5. **Transparent Pricing**: No hidden fees, clear value prop

---

### What Didn't Work (Avoid This)

1. **Too Many Features at Once**: CEO overwhelmed in Week 1 ‚Üí focus on 3-4 core tiles
2. **Assuming Technical Knowledge**: CEO not familiar with "API" or "dashboard" terms ‚Üí simplify language
3. **Generic Templates**: Hot rod-specific examples resonate more than generic e-commerce
4. **Delayed Feedback Response**: CEO frustrated when bug took 24 hours to fix ‚Üí fix critical bugs same-day

---

### Key Insights

1. **CEO Time is Precious**: Keep calls <30 min, provide TL;DR summaries
2. **Visuals > Words**: Screenshots and screen recordings > long emails
3. **ROI Must Be Obvious**: Track time saved weekly, show dollar value
4. **Testimonials Are Gold**: CEO testimonial = 10x more credible than our marketing
5. **Vertical Positioning Works**: "Built for hot rod shops" resonates more than "Works for Shopify stores"
