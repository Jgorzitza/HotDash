# Post-Deployment Feedback Collection

**Purpose**: Systematic collection of CEO feedback after deployment  
**Owner**: Product Agent  
**Timeline**: First 30 days post-deployment  
**Goal**: Understand CEO experience, identify improvements, validate product-market fit

---

## 🎯 Feedback Collection Strategy

**Principle**: Collect feedback continuously, not just during scheduled calls

**Methods**:
1. **Slack Check-ins** (Daily Week 1, 3x/week Week 2-4)
2. **Quick Calls** (Weekly 15-min)
3. **In-App Surveys** (After 3, 7, 14, 30 days)
4. **Usage Data** (Analytics - what CEO actually does)
5. **Support Tickets** (What CEO reports as broken)
