---

## Executive Summary

The Voice of Customer (VoC) program ensures **continuous feedback collection** from Hot Rodan and future customers, enabling rapid iteration and product-market fit.

**Program Goals**:
1. **Listen**: Capture operator feedback (verbatim quotes, pain points, feature requests)
2. **Synthesize**: Identify patterns and prioritize improvements
3. **Act**: Ship improvements based on feedback within 1-2 weeks
4. **Close Loop**: Communicate back to operators ("We heard you, we built X")

**Feedback Channels**: Daily Slack, weekly surveys, monthly calls, quarterly interviews

**Success Metric**: 90% of operators feel "heard and understood" (survey question)

---

## Part 1: VoC Program Overview

### Why Voice of Customer Matters

**Operator-First Philosophy**: Operators (CEOs, team leads) are our internal customers‚Äîtheir needs drive product decisions.

**Benefits of Strong VoC**:
- ‚úÖ **Product-market fit**: Build what operators actually need (not what we think they need)
- ‚úÖ **Retention**: Operators who feel heard stay longer (low churn)
- ‚úÖ **Referrals**: Happy operators become advocates (word-of-mouth growth)
- ‚úÖ **Roadmap clarity**: Customer feedback = clear feature priorities
- ‚úÖ **Competitive moat**: Deep customer relationships hard to replicate

**HotDash Commitment**: We will respond to every piece of feedback within 24 hours.

---

### VoC Principles

1. **Listen More Than Talk** (80/20 rule)
   - 80% listening to operator
   - 20% explaining product

2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions** ("What frustrated you?" not "Did you like X?")

3. **Capture Verbatim Quotes** (exact words operators use)

4. **Avoid Leading Questions** ("What would you improve?" not "Don't you think X is great?")

5. **Close the Feedback Loop** ("You asked for X, we built it‚Äîcheck it out!")

---

## Part 2: Feedback Collection Channels

### Channel 1: Daily Slack Messages (Asynchronous)

**Purpose**: Low-friction way for operators to share thoughts anytime

**Setup**:
- Private Slack channel: `#hotdash-pilot-feedback`

**Prompts** (Post these in Slack to encourage feedback):
- "What did you use HotDash for today?"
- "Any bugs or issues you noticed?"
- "What feature would make your day easier?"

**Example Messages**:
```
CEO: "Inventory alert saved me today‚ÄîChrome Headers were at 4 units, ordered more just in time üôå"

CEO: "Approval queue is slower today, taking 10 seconds to load üòï"

CEO: "Wish I could export sales data to CSV‚Äîsending to accountant weekly"
```

**Response Time**: <2 hours for issues, <24 hours for feature requests

## Part 3: Feedback Synthesis Process

### Step 1: Capture Feedback (Daily)

**All Feedback Goes Into Feedback Log**: `feedback/product.md`

**Format**:
```markdown
### 2025-10-15 - Hot Rodan CEO Feedback

**Channel**: Slack  
**Quote**: "Inventory alert saved me today‚ÄîChrome Headers were at 4 units"

**Category**: Win / Feature Works  
**Action**: Celebrate, document as success story  
**Priority**: N/A (positive feedback)
```

**Categories**:
- üéâ Win / Feature Works
- üòï Frustration / Bug
- üí° Feature Request
- üìä Usage Data
- üó£Ô∏è Testimonial-Worthy Quote

---

### Step 2: Tag & Categorize (Weekly)

**Categorization Framework**:

| Category | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Bug** | Something broken | "Approval queue slow to load" |
| **Feature Request** | New capability desired | "Export to CSV" |
| **UX Improvement** | Existing feature needs polish | "Keyboard shortcuts would be nice" |
| **Win** | Something working well | "Inventory alerts are amazing" |
| **Pain Point** | Recurring frustration | "Switching between 5 tabs is annoying" |
| **ROI Evidence** | Measurable value | "Saved 2 hours today" |
| **Testimonial** | Quote-worthy praise | "HotDash gave me my weekends back" |

**Tools**: Airtable, Notion, or Google Sheets for feedback database

---

### Step 3: Identify Patterns (Weekly)

**Every Monday Morning** (30 minutes):
- Review last week's feedback
- Group by category
- Count frequency ("Export to CSV" mentioned 3 times this week)
- Identify emerging trends

**Pattern Questions**:
1. What's the #1 frustration this week? (mentioned most often)
2. What's the #1 requested feature? (highest priority to operators)
3. What's working really well? (preserve and amplify)
4. Any new pain points emerging? (previously not mentioned)
5. Is satisfaction trending up or down? (compare weekly survey scores)

**Output**: "Top 3 Patterns This Week" doc

---

### Step 4: Prioritize Actions (Monday Planning)

**Prioritization Framework**: RICE Score (Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence / Effort)

**Example**:
| Feedback | Category | RICE Score | Action |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| "Export to CSV" | Feature Request | 20.0 | Ship in Week 1 |
| "Slow page load" | Bug | 13.3 | Fix in Week 1 |
| "Dark mode" | UX Improvement | 2.0 | Defer to Month 3 |

**Prioritization Output**: Sprint plan for next week (top 3 priorities)

---

### Step 5: Close the Loop (Weekly)

**Respond to Feedback Within 1 Week**:

**For Feature Requests**:
- If YES (building it): "Great idea! We're shipping 'Export to CSV' next Friday."
- If NOT YET (roadmap): "Love this idea‚Äîadded to Q2 roadmap. Here's why..."
- If NO (not aligned): "Interesting idea, but doesn't fit vertical focus. Here's alternative..."

**For Bugs**:
- **<2 hours**: "We're investigating X, will fix ASAP"
- **<24 hours**: "Fixed! Can you confirm it's working now?"

**For Wins**:
- **<1 day**: "So happy to hear this! Mind if we share your quote as testimonial?"

**Communication Channel**: Slack, email, or mention in weekly check-in call

---

## Part 4: Feedback-Driven Roadmap Process

### How Customer Feedback Influences Roadmap

**Product Roadmap Sources** (in priority order):
1. **Customer Requests** (70%): What operators explicitly ask for
2. **Usage Data** (20%): What operators actually use (vs say they want)
3. **Strategic Bets** (10%): What we believe will delight operators (even if not requested)

**Process**:
1. **Collect**: All feedback goes into feedback log
2. **Synthesize**: Weekly pattern analysis
3. **Prioritize**: RICE scoring
4. **Commit**: Top 3 features per week go into sprint
5. **Ship**: Release features weekly
6. **Communicate**: Close loop with customers

**Transparency**: Share roadmap with customers (public Trello board or Notion page)

---

### Example: From Feedback to Feature (1-Week Cycle)

**Monday Oct 14**: Hot Rodan CEO mentions in Slack: "Wish I could export sales data to CSV"

**Tuesday Oct 15**: 
- Product Agent logs feature request
- Calculates RICE score: 20.0 (high priority)
- Adds to sprint plan

**Wednesday Oct 16**: 
- Engineer builds "Export to CSV" button
- QA tests feature

**Thursday Oct 17**: 
- Deploy to staging
- Product Agent previews feature with CEO (Slack screenshot)

**Friday Oct 18**: 
- Deploy to production
- Product Agent: "We heard you wanted CSV export‚Äîit's live! Try it out and let us know what you think."

**Result**: Customer feels heard, feature shipped in 4 days.
