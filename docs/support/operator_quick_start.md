2. Edit box appears
3. Make your changes

## 💡 Quick Tips for New Operators

### Do's ✅

**1. Trust AI, But Verify**
- AI is usually right (70-80% accurate)
- Always read carefully before approving
- Check facts against playbooks if unsure

**2. Modify Freely**
- Small tweaks are normal
- Personalize responses (use customer details)
- Adjust tone to match customer's style

**3. Provide Rejection Feedback**
- Always note WHY you rejected
- Helps AI learn from mistakes
- Improves accuracy over time

**4. Ask for Help**
- Unsure? Ask your manager or team lead
- Reference playbooks (keep them open)
- Don't guess — escalate if complex

**5. Track Your Metrics**
- Check your approval rate daily
- Aim for >70% (shows AI is working)
- If <50%, report to manager (AI needs training)

### Don'ts ❌

**1. Don't Blindly Approve**
- ❌ "AI is smart, I'll just click approve"
- Risk: Wrong info goes to customers

**2. Don't Over-Modify**
- ❌ Rewriting entire response when 1 word needs changing
- Wastes time, defeats purpose of AI assistance

**3. Don't Reject Without Reason**
- ❌ Clicking reject without noting why
- AI can't learn without feedback

**4. Don't Let Queue Build Up**
- ❌ Ignoring approval queue for hours
- Customers wait longer, defeats "fast response" goal

**5. Don't Approve Unsafe Advice**
- ❌ "It's probably fine..."
- Safety first, always reject unsafe suggestions

## 🚨 When to Escalate

**Escalate to Manager If**:
- [ ] AI gives unsafe advice (fuel, brakes, safety-critical)
- [ ] Customer is angry or threatening
- [ ] Policy exception needed (refund outside window, special discount)
- [ ] High-value order (>$5,000)
- [ ] You're unsure and can't find answer in playbooks

**Escalation Process**:
```
1. Click [REJECT] (don't send AI response)
2. Tag ticket: [ESCALATION]
3. Notify manager (Slack or email)
4. Tell customer: "I'm getting our [manager/technical team] 
   involved to give you the best answer. You'll hear back 
   within [timeframe]."
```

## 🆘 Common First-Day Questions

### Q: What if I'm not sure about a response?

**A**: MODIFY or REJECT, then ask for help. Never approve something you're uncertain about. Reference playbooks or ask your manager.

### Q: How fast should I be?

**A**: Quality > Speed. Take your time the first few days. Target <5 min per response, but accuracy matters more than speed.

### Q: What if AI keeps making the same mistake?

**A**: Report the pattern to your manager. If AI makes the same error 3+ times, it needs retraining.

### Q: Can I work from my phone?

**A**: Yes! HotDash works on mobile (Shopify app). Best for quick approvals when away from desk.

### Q: What if I approve something wrong?

**A**: Immediately notify your manager. We can send a correction to the customer. Mistakes happen, we'll fix it together.
