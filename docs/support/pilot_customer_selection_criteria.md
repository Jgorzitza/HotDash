# Pilot Customer Selection Criteria (Draft)

## Purpose
Define who should join the Hot Rodan pilot and how we evaluate success.

## Ideal Profile
- Shopify store with active sales in last 30 days
- 2–10 support conversations/day (steady but manageable volume)
- At least one operator who will use OCC tiles daily
- Willing to provide feedback weekly during pilot

## Screening Questions
1. How many daily orders and support conversations do you handle?
2. Who will act as the designated operator(s)?
3. Which workflows are most painful today (CX, fulfillment, inventory, content)?
4. Are you able to run a weekly 30-minute check-in for 4 weeks?

## Success Criteria
- Operator adoption: ≥70% of days with at least one OCC session
- Tile engagement: ≥2 tiles used per session on average
- SLA: Median time-to-resolution ≤60 minutes for escalations
- Qualitative: Operators report reduced tab fatigue and faster approvals

## Feedback Plan
- Weekly survey (5 questions) + 30-minute interview
- Capture evidence: screenshots, timestamps, approval IDs
- Feed issues into product backlog with references to OCC tiles

## Timeline
- Week 0: Onboarding + baseline metrics
- Weeks 1–3: Pilot execution + weekly feedback
- Week 4: Final evaluation and go/no-go for broader rollout
