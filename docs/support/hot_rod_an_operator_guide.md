## üîß Essential Automotive Terminology

### Basic Terms (Know These!)

**Hot Rod**:
- Modified vehicle (usually vintage) built for performance
- Emphasis on power, speed, style
- Example: "'32 Ford hot rod with small block Chevy"

**AN Fittings** (Army-Navy):
- Military-spec fittings for fuel, oil, and fluid lines
- Known for reliability, no leaks, professional look
- Used instead of rubber hose clamps

**Fuel System**:
- Everything that delivers fuel from tank to engine
- Includes: Tank, lines, pump, filter, regulator, carburetor/EFI

**Carburetor** (Carb):
- Mixes air and fuel for combustion
- Older technology (pre-fuel injection)
- Common brands: Holley, Edelbrock, Demon

**EFI** (Electronic Fuel Injection):
- Computer-controlled fuel delivery
- Modern technology, more efficient than carbs
- Common in newer builds

**LS Swap**:
- Replacing original engine with Chevy LS engine
- Popular upgrade (LS engines are powerful, reliable, plentiful)
- Example: "LS-swapping my '69 Camaro"

---

### AN Fitting Terminology

**AN Size** (Dash Number):
- AN-4, AN-6, AN-8, AN-10, etc.
- Number = size in 1/16" increments
- **AN-6 = 6/16" = 3/8"** (most common fuel line size)
- **AN-8 = 8/16" = 1/2"** (larger fuel systems)

**Flare**:
- 37¬∞ angled sealing surface on AN fittings
- Metal-to-metal seal (no gasket needed)
- Must be smooth and clean to seal properly

**NPT** (National Pipe Thread):
- Tapered threads used on carburetors, fuel pumps
- **Requires thread sealant** (unlike AN fittings)
- Common sizes: 1/8" NPT, 1/4" NPT, 3/8" NPT

**ORB** (O-Ring Boss):
- Straight threads with O-ring seal
- Common on fuel pressure regulators, some pumps
- **No thread sealant** (O-ring does the sealing)

**Swivel Fittings**:
- Fittings that rotate to absorb vibration
- Prevent loosening over time
- More expensive but highly reliable

**Hose Ends**:
- Fittings that attach to braided or rubber hose
- Consist of nipple (inside hose) and socket (outside)
- Reusable with proper care

---

### Engine & Performance Terms

**Small Block**:
- Chevy V8 engine (265-400 cubic inches)
- Examples: 283, 327, 350, 383
- Most common hot rod engine

**Big Block**:
- Larger Chevy V8 (396-502 cubic inches)
- More power, heavier, thirstier
- Examples: 396, 427, 454

**Horsepower** (HP):
- Power output of engine
- Determines fuel system size needs:
  - <300 HP: AN-6 fuel line
  - 300-500 HP: AN-6 to AN-8
  - 500-700 HP: AN-8
  - 700+ HP: AN-10 or larger

**Street/Strip**:
- Dual-purpose vehicle (street legal + race weekends)
- Most common Hot Rod AN customer type
- Balance of performance and drivability

**Forced Induction**:
- Turbocharger or supercharger (adds boost/pressure)
- Increases horsepower significantly
- Requires larger fuel system

---

### Racing Terminology

**Race Weekend**:
- Saturday/Sunday event at drag strip or road course
- **URGENT for customers** (need parts by Friday!)
- Common request: "I have a race this Saturday"

**Staging Lanes**:
- Where race cars line up before racing
- Context: "My car died in the staging lanes" = fuel system failure

**Tech Inspection** (Tech):
- Safety inspection before racing
- Fuel system must meet safety requirements
- Context: "Will this pass tech?" = Is it safe/legal?

**ET** (Elapsed Time):
- Time to complete 1/4 mile drag race
- Context: "My ET dropped" = car got slower (fuel starvation?)

**Trap Speed**:
- Speed at end of drag race
- Indicator of horsepower and performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Customer Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sizing Question

**Customer Says**: *"What size AN fitting do I need for my 350 small block with 3/8" hose?"*

**How to Respond**:
```
1. Identify hose size: 3/8"
2. Match to AN size: 3/8" = AN-6
3. Consider horsepower: 350 HP = AN-6 is perfect
4. Provide answer + context
```

**Your Response**:
```
"Hi [Name],

For 3/8" fuel hose, you'll need AN-6 fittings. That's the perfect
size for your 350 HP small block.

You'll need:
‚Ä¢ AN-6 hose ends (for your braided line)
‚Ä¢ AN-6 to NPT adapters (to connect to carburetor & fuel pump)
‚Ä¢ AN-4 for your return line (if you're running one)

What carburetor and fuel pump are you using? I can help you
identify the specific adapters you need!

Best,
[Your Name]"
```

**Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ Answer the question directly (AN-6)
- ‚úÖ Explain why (matches 3/8", appropriate for 350 HP)
- ‚úÖ Suggest related parts (adapters)
- ‚úÖ Offer further help

---

### Scenario 2: Race Weekend Urgency

**Customer Says**: *"I have a race this Saturday and my fuel fitting just broke. Can you overnight this to me?"*

**How to Respond**:
```
1. Recognize urgency (race weekend = deadline)
2. Check inventory (is part in stock?)
3. Verify address and shipping
4. Offer overnight shipping
5. Set expectations clearly
```

**Your Response**:
```
"Hi [Name],

I totally understand the urgency ‚Äî race weekends wait for no one!

Good news: [Part] is in stock and we can ship overnight.

To get it to you by Friday:
‚Ä¢ Order by 3:00 PM EST today (it's [current time])
‚Ä¢ Overnight shipping: $[cost]

### Scenario 3: Fuel Leak Troubleshooting

**Customer Says**: *"My AN-6 fitting is leaking fuel at the carburetor connection. I tightened it really tight but it still leaks."*

**How to Respond**:
```
1. Identify issue: Fuel leak at connection
2. Note detail: "really tight" = possibly over-tightened!
3. Troubleshoot systematically
4. Provide fix or escalate if complex
```

**Your Response**:
```
"Hi [Name],

Let's diagnose that leak. A couple possibilities:

1. Over-tightening: AN fittings seal with the 37¬∞ flare, not
   thread pressure. If you cranked it too tight, you may have
   damaged the flare. It should be snug + 1/8 turn. No more!

2. Wrong fitting type: What does your carburetor inlet have?
   ‚Ä¢ 37¬∞ AN flare = Use AN fitting (metal-to-metal, no sealant)
   ‚Ä¢ Straight threads with O-ring groove = Use ORB fitting
   ‚Ä¢ Tapered threads = Use NPT fitting (with sealant)

3. Damaged flare: Remove the fitting and inspect the 37¬∞ cone.
   Look for scratches, dents, or deformation. If damaged, it
   needs to be replaced.

Can you tell me what type of carburetor you have (Holley, Edelbrock?)
and what the inlet looks like? I can help you identify the right fix!

Best,
[Your Name]"
```

**Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ Diagnose, don't assume
- ‚úÖ Educate (proper tightening, fitting types)
- ‚úÖ Guide customer through inspection
- ‚úÖ Offer to help identify correct part

### Scenario 4: LS Swap Fuel System

**Customer Says**: *"I'm LS-swapping my '70 Chevelle. What fuel system do I need for a 450 HP LS3?"*

**How to Respond**:
```
1. Recognize project type (LS swap = popular, well-defined)
2. Horsepower: 450 HP = AN-6 or AN-8
3. Recommend complete system (pump, lines, regulator)
4. Set expectations (this is a bigger conversation)
```

**Your Response**:
```
"Hi [Name],

Nice project! LS swaps are awesome. For your 450 HP LS3, here's
what you need:

Fuel Line Size:
‚Ä¢ AN-6 (3/8") will work, but AN-8 (1/2") gives more headroom
‚Ä¢ Recommendation: AN-8 for reliability and future upgrades

Fuel System Components:
‚Ä¢ Electric fuel pump (140 GPH minimum, 58 PSI for EFI)
‚Ä¢ High-pressure fuel pressure regulator (adjustable, returnless or return-style)
‚Ä¢ AN-8 braided fuel line (from tank to engine)
‚Ä¢ AN-6 return line (if running return-style system)
‚Ä¢ AN fittings and adapters to match your components

Are you running a carburetor or EFI on that LS3? (Affects pump
and regulator choice)

Also, I have a complete LS swap fuel system kit that might save
you time. Want me to send details?

Best,
[Your Name]"
```

**Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ Show enthusiasm (match customer's excitement)
- ‚úÖ Provide comprehensive answer (not just one fitting)
- ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions (carb vs EFI)
- ‚úÖ Suggest kit (easier, complete solution)
