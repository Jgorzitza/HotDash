# Community Engagement Guidelines (Draft)

## Purpose
Define Hot Rodan's communication style and engagement strategy for hot rod enthusiast communities across forums, social media, and customer interactions.

## Audience
Support team, social media managers, and anyone representing Hot Rodan in community spaces.

## Hot Rod Community Culture

### Core Values
- **Craftsmanship**: Respect for builds, attention to detail, quality over shortcuts
- **Community**: Sharing knowledge, helping fellow enthusiasts, camaraderie
- **Performance**: Results-driven, data and dyno sheets matter
- **Authenticity**: Real builds, honest advice, no BS marketing

### Communication Principles
1. **Be genuine**: Speak as a fellow enthusiast, not corporate
2. **Respect expertise**: Many customers know more than you; acknowledge and learn
3. **Share knowledge**: Help first, sell second
4. **Celebrate builds**: Show excitement for customer projects
5. **Own mistakes**: Apologize sincerely, fix it fast, learn publicly

## Brand Voice for Automotive Audience

### Tone Attributes
- **Confident but humble**: "We know our stuff, but always learning"
- **Technical yet accessible**: Use proper terms, explain when needed
- **Enthusiastic without hype**: Genuine excitement, not sales pitch
- **Direct and honest**: No fluff, just facts and solutions

### Language Guidelines

#### ✅ Do Use
- Technical terminology (AN fittings, CFM, compression ratio)
- Build-specific language ("What are you building?", "Sweet setup!")
- Performance metrics (HP, torque, ET, MPH)
- Community phrases ("That thing rips!", "Clean build", "Runs strong")

#### ❌ Avoid
- Corporate jargon ("leverage", "synergy", "circle back")
- Overselling ("game-changing", "revolutionary", "best ever")
- Condescending tone ("As I'm sure you know...", "Obviously...")
- Vague promises ("We'll get back to you", "Soon", "ASAP" without specifics)

### Example Responses

#### Bad (Corporate, Vague)
> "Thank you for reaching out! We're committed to providing world-class solutions. A team member will circle back shortly."

#### Good (Enthusiast, Specific)
> "Nice! Building a 383 stroker is a solid choice. That Holley 750 will work great - you'll want -8 AN fittings for the inlets. I can get this kit shipped today if you order by 2pm EST. Here's the install guide: [link]"

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Forums (e.g., HotRodForum, BangShift)

#### Engagement Strategy
- Monitor threads mentioning Hot Rodan or relevant products
- Provide helpful technical input, not just sales
- Use forum signature with support contact, not heavy branding
- Participate in community discussions beyond our products

#### Response Template
1. Acknowledge the question/issue
2. Provide technical insight or solution
3. Offer product recommendation if relevant (not required)
4. Invite DM for order support if interested

**Example**:
> That's a common issue with older Holley pumps - the check valve can stick. Try tapping it lightly or replacing the valve. If you need a new pump, the one we carry has the updated valve design and includes the mounting bracket. Happy to help if you want to grab one - DM me or call the shop.

### Social Media (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube)

#### Content Types
- **Customer builds**: Showcase with credit, celebrate the work
- **Tech tips**: Quick how-tos, torque specs, common fixes
- **Product features**: Highlight benefits with real-world context
- **Event coverage**: Racing, shows, community gatherings

#### Commenting Strategy
- Reply to every mention and tag (within 24 hours)
- Answer technical questions publicly (helps others)
- Escalate complex issues to DM
- Celebrate customer wins (race results, build completions)

**Example Comments**:
- On customer build photo: "That fuel system looks dialed! Love the braided lines. What size AN fittings did you run?"
- On technical question: "For that setup you'll want a 7-9 PSI regulator. The one we stock includes the gauge and mounting bracket. DM if you need a link."
- On race result: "Congrats on the win! That 60-foot time is killer. What gear ratio are you running?"

### Direct Customer Interactions

#### Opening Engagement
- Show interest in their project: "What are you building?"
- Match their energy level (casual or technical)
- Acknowledge their expertise when evident

#### Handling Technical Questions
1. Clarify the application (engine, use case, goals)
2. Provide accurate technical guidance
3. Recommend products that fit the need, not what's in stock
4. Escalate to specialist if beyond your knowledge

#### Celebrating Success
- When customer shares completed build or race win, celebrate it
- Ask if we can share their story (with credit)
- Offer small thank-you (discount code, sticker pack)

## Community Red Flags → Escalate

### Escalate to Manager If:
- Negative viral post/review gaining traction
- Influencer criticism with significant reach
- Forum thread with multiple complaints about same issue
- Request for sponsorship or partnership
- Safety concern or product defect discussion

### Crisis Response (Wait for Manager)
- Don't engage defensively
- Acknowledge you've seen it: "We're looking into this"
- Loop in manager immediately
- Coordinate unified response (no lone wolf fixes)

## Advocacy & Loyalty Building

### Turn Customers into Advocates
1. **Exceed expectations**: Fast shipping, personal touch, expert advice
2. **Ask for feedback**: "How'd the install go? Any tips for others?"
3. **Feature their builds**: Social media, blog, email newsletter
4. **Recognize loyalty**: "We appreciate you coming back - here's 10% off"

### Community Partnerships
- **Local clubs**: Offer tech talks, sponsor events
- **Online forums**: Verified expert badge, tech support presence
- **Content creators**: Product seeding, collaboration, honest reviews
- **Race teams**: Contingency programs, event support, mutual promotion
