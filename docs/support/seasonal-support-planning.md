## 🚀 Surge Support Protocols

### Peak Season Preparation (April 1)

**Staffing Plan**:
```
Winter Team: 2 operators
Spring Ramp: +1 operator (March)
Summer Peak: +2 more operators (May)
Total Summer: 5 operators

Training Timeline:
• Hire: February
• Train: March (4 weeks)
• Supervised: April (2 weeks)
• Independent: May 1 (ready for peak!)
```

**Inventory Preparation**:
```
Stock levels (vs winter):
• AN-6 fittings: 3X inventory
• AN-8 fittings: 2X inventory
• Braided hose (AN-6): 2X inventory
• Fuel regulators: 2X inventory
• Popular adapters: 2X inventory

Order early (March) to avoid supplier backorders!
```

**Process Optimization**:
```
• Extend rush order cutoff: 3pm → 4pm (if possible with warehouse)
• Add Saturday AM coverage (10am-2pm for emergency inquiries)
• Pre-write rush order templates (save time on busy days)
• Pre-negotiate carrier rates (volume discounts)
```

---

### Weekend & After-Hours Coverage

**Summer Weekends (June-August)**:

**Friday Evening** (5pm-8pm):
- Skeleton crew (1 operator on-call)
- Handle: Urgent race weekend inquiries
- "My car broke at the track, need parts tomorrow!"
- Process: Rush orders for Saturday delivery (if possible)

**Saturday Morning** (9am-12pm):

- Handle: Emergency parts needs
- "My fitting broke this morning, race is at 2pm, any local stores?"
- Provide: Local retailer referrals, same-day solutions

**Sunday**: No coverage (race day, customers at track)

**Alternative**: AI-assisted email auto-responses
- "Thanks for your message! We're away for the weekend but will
  respond first thing Monday. If this is urgent, call [emergency line]."

---

### Holiday Coverage

**Major Holidays** (Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day):
- Peak racing weekends!

## 🎯 Peak Season Survival Guide

### Operator Tips for Summer Surge

**Managing High Volume**:

**1. Prioritize Ruthlessly**
```
Priority 1 (Handle First):
• Race this weekend (hard deadline)
• Safety issues (fuel leaks, brake problems)
• VIP customers (high-value accounts)

Priority 2 (Handle Same Day):
• Standard product questions
• Troubleshooting (not time-sensitive)
• General inquiries

Priority 3 (Handle Next Day):
• Follow-ups
• Non-urgent questions
• "Just browsing" inquiries
```

**2. Use AI Efficiency**
```
• Trust AI drafts (70%+ are accurate)
• APPROVE quickly when response is good
• Don't over-modify (minor tweaks only)
• Save time for complex issues
```

**3. Batch Similar Questions**
```
• Multiple AN sizing questions? Answer in batch
• Common issues? Use saved responses
• Rush orders? Process in groups (warehouse efficiency)
```

**4. Take Care of Yourself**
```
• Peak season is intense (50-60 hour weeks possible)
• Take breaks (every 2 hours, 10 minutes)
• Hydrate and eat (don't skip meals!)
• Ask for help (team support)
• It's temporary (fall brings relief!)
```
