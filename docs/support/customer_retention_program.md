**Action**: Re-engage, incentive offers, check-in

```

- VIP activity (orders, engagement, referrals)

**Monthly Review**:
- Churn rate trend
- LTV by segment
- Retention campaign ROI
- Loyalty program engagement

## Retention Best Practices

### Prevent Churn

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Declining order frequency (was monthly, now 90 days)
- Email disengagement (not opening/clicking)
- Support issues (negative interactions)
- Price sensitivity (only buying on deep discount)

**Proactive Actions**:
- Check in before they churn (at 45-60 days)
- Resolve support issues immediately (don't let them fester)
- Offer value beyond discounts (education, community, expertise)

### Maximize Value

**Upsell/Cross-Sell**:
- "Customers who bought X also bought Y"
- "Complete your fuel system with [complementary part]"
- "Upgrade to [premium version] for $[X] more"

**Build Sequences**:
- Fuel system → Ignition → Exhaust → Engine (natural progression)
- Track purchases and suggest next logical step
- "Building a stroker? You'll need [X next]"

### Foster Advocacy

**Turn Customers into Advocates**:
1. Exceed expectations (fast shipping, expert help, surprise gifts)
2. Ask for reviews (post-purchase, after 30 days)
3. Feature their builds (social media, newsletter)
4. Reward referrals (credits, recognition, exclusive access)

**Advocate Actions**:
- Leave reviews (5-star testimonials)
- Refer friends (word-of-mouth marketing)
- Share builds (social media tags, community posts)
- Defend brand (respond to negativity, promote positives)
