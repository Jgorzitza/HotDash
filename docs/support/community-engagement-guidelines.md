## 🗣️ Communication Style Guide

### Tone Examples

**✅ Good (Hot Rod AN Style)**:
```
"That twin-turbo LS sounds sick! For 1200 HP, you'll need AN-10
feed lines minimum. Are you running E85 or pump gas? Makes a
difference for fuel system sizing.

We can set you up with everything you need. Let's build it right!"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Enthusiastic ("sounds sick!")
- Technical ("AN-10 feed lines")
- Helpful (asks clarifying questions)
- Confident ("Let's build it right!")

---

**❌ Bad (Too Corporate)**:
```
"Thank you for your inquiry regarding fuel line sizing. Per our
technical specifications, AN-10 designation is recommended for
applications exceeding 1000 horsepower.

Please contact our sales department to discuss your requirements.

Respectfully,
Support Team"
```

**Why This Fails**:
- Overly formal ("per our technical specifications")
- Impersonal (no excitement)
- Redirects instead of helps ("contact sales department")
- Signed "Support Team" (not personal)

---

**❌ Bad (Too Casual)**:
```
"Yo dude that's gonna be insane lol 😂 

def need huge lines bro, like AN-10 at least maybe bigger idk

hmu if u wanna order 🔥🔥🔥"
```

**Why This Fails**:
- Too casual ("Yo dude")
- Unprofessional ("lol", multiple emojis)
- Uncertain ("idk")
- Not helpful (vague, no specific guidance)

---

### Language Guidelines

**Use Hot Rod Terminology**:
- ✅ "Hot rod", "muscle car", "race car"
- ✅ "Small block", "big block", "LS swap"
- ✅ "Carb", "fuel system", "headers"
- ✅ "Race weekend", "drag strip", "time slip"

**Avoid Generic Terms**:
- ❌ "Vehicle" → Use "hot rod" or "race car"
- ❌ "Propulsion system" → Use "engine" or "motor"
- ❌ "Automotive event" → Use "race" or "car show"

**Be Specific, Not Vague**:
- ✅ "AN-6 (3/8") for up to 400 HP"
- ❌ "A medium-sized fitting for moderate power"

**Use Enthusiasm Appropriately**:
- ✅ "That sounds like an awesome build!"
- ✅ "Nice! How did the race go?"
- ❌ "OMG that's so cool!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉"

---

## 💬 Forum & Social Media Engagement

### Where Hot Rodders Gather Online

**Major Forums**:
- The H.A.M.B. (traditional hot rods)
- Lateral-g (pro-touring, modern tech)
- LS1Tech (LS swaps and tech)
- Speedtalk (general hot rod discussion)
- Brand-specific forums (Holley, Edelbrock, etc.)

**Social Media**:
- Facebook Groups (Hot Rod Builders, LS Swap, etc.)
- Instagram (#hotrod, #lsswap, #anFittings)
- YouTube (build vlogs, race videos)
- Reddit (r/projectcar, r/cars, r/Autos)

**Our Presence**:
- Answer technical questions (provide value)
- Share customer builds (with permission)
- Support community events
- Sponsor discussions/threads

---

### Forum Engagement Best Practices

**Do's ✅**:

**1. Provide Value First**
```
Customer posts: "Need help sizing fuel lines for 450 HP LS3"

✅ Helpful response:
"For 450 HP LS3, AN-8 (1/2") feed and AN-6 (3/8") return will
handle it nicely. Are you running carb or keeping it EFI?

That changes your fuel pressure requirements:
• Carb: 5-7 PSI with adjustable regulator
• EFI: 58 PSI with high-pressure pump

Happy to help you spec out a complete system if you need!"

[Sign with first name only, not "Hot Rod AN Sales"]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Answers question directly
- Provides additional context
- Offers further help
- Not overly sales-y

---

**2. Be Humble**
```
✅ "That's a great question. Let me check our tech specs and get back to you with accurate info."

❌ "I know everything about fuel systems. Trust me, I'm an expert."
```

**3. Give Credit**
```
If another forum member gives good advice:
✅ "+1 to this! [Member] is spot-on. That's exactly how we recommend sizing fuel lines."

Shows: We're collaborative, not competitive
```

**4. Share Success Stories**
```
"One of our customers just ran 9.50s in his bracket car with our
AN-8 fuel system. Fuel pressure stayed rock solid all day. Love
seeing our parts perform!"

Shows: Real results, community participation
```

**5. Support the Community**
```
• Answer questions even if not directly about our products
• Share knowledge freely
• Sponsor forum events/meetups
• Participate in discussions (not just sales)
```

---

### Don'ts ❌

**1. Don't Spam**
```
❌ Posting "Check out Hot Rod AN!" on every thread
❌ Unsolicited product mentions
❌ Hijacking threads to promote products
```

**2. Don't Argue**
```
❌ "You're wrong! Our products are the best!"
❌ Getting into fights with competitors
❌ Defending negative reviews aggressively

✅ "We appreciate the feedback. Let's discuss offline so we can make it right."
```

**3. Don't Fake Knowledge**
```
❌ "Yeah, that'll work" (when you're not sure)
✅ "Good question! Let me verify with our tech team and get back to you."
```

**4. Don't Ignore Criticism**
```
❌ Deleting negative comments
❌ Ignoring complaints

✅ "Thanks for the feedback. Can you email support@hotrodan.com so we can make this right?"
```

**5. Don't Be Salesy**
```
❌ "Buy our products! 20% off today only!"
❌ Every response ends with "Check out our website!"

✅ Focus on helping first, selling second
```

## 📱 Social Media Best Practices

### Instagram Engagement

**Content to Share**:
- Customer build photos (with permission and credit)
- Product installation guides (video clips)
- Race weekend shoutouts ("Good luck to [Customer] racing today!")
- Technical tips ("AN fitting installation tip of the day")

**Engagement Style**:
```
Customer posts build with our parts:
✅ "That's a clean install! 🔥 The AN-8 lines look perfect on that
    big block. Good luck at the track this weekend!"

Customer asks question in comments:
✅ "Great question! For that application, AN-6 should work perfectly.
    DM us if you want to chat specifics!"
```

**Use Emojis** (But Sparingly):
- 🔥 Fire (for impressive builds)
- 🏁 Checkered flag (for race references)
- 🔧 Wrench (for technical content)
- ✅ Checkmark (for confirmations)
- 🚗 Car (for projects)

**Don't Overdo It**: 1-2 emojis max per comment

---

### Facebook Groups

**Participation Style**:
- Help members with technical questions
- Share relevant content (installation videos, guides)
- Announce new products (occasionally, not spam)
- Support group events and meetups

**Example Participation**:
```
Member posts: "Having trouble with fuel leak at my AN fitting"

✅ Our response:
"[Member name], let's troubleshoot! A few common causes:

1. Check if it's tightened properly: Snug + 1/8 turn (don't over-tighten!)
2. Inspect the 37° flare: Any scratches or dents?
3. Make sure you're using AN flare to AN flare (not AN to NPT)

Here's our troubleshooting guide: [link]

If you post a photo, I can help diagnose!

- [Your First Name]"
```

**Signs With**: First name only (authentic, not corporate)

---

### YouTube Engagement

**Comment on Build Videos**:
- Compliment the build
- Offer technical insights (if relevant)
- Answer questions in comments
- Support creators (like, subscribe, share)

**Example Comment**:
```
Customer's build video features our AN fittings:

✅ "Great build! The AN-8 fuel system looks super clean. 
    That 500 HP small block is going to love the flow from those 
    1/2" lines. Good luck at the track! 🏁

    - Team Hot Rod AN"
```

**Don't**:
- ❌ Spam promotional comments on every video
- ❌ Post negative comments on competitor products
- ❌ Ask for shoutouts ("Feature us in your next video!")

---

## 🤝 Event Engagement

### Car Shows & Race Events

**When Hot Rod AN Attends**:
- Set up booth/tent (display products)
- Talk to builders (educate, don't just sell)
- Offer support ("Need help with sizing? I'm here!")
- Collect contact info (build email list)
- Take photos (customer builds, events)
- Sponsor prizes/awards (best fuel system, etc.)

**Engagement Style at Events**:
```
Visitor: "What size AN fitting do I need?"

✅ Helpful approach:
"Let's figure it out! What's your setup?
• Engine HP?
• Fuel hose size?
• Carburetor or EFI?

[Help them size correctly]

Here's a spec card with all the info. Take your time deciding!
If you have questions later, here's my card—just call or email."

Shows: Expertise, patience, genuine help (not just "buy this!")
```

**Follow-Up After Events**:
```
Email attendees:
"Great meeting you at [Event]! How's your [project] coming along?

Let me know if you need any help with those AN fittings we discussed.

Also, here are some resources that might help:
• [Installation guide]
• [Sizing chart]
• [FAQ]

Hope to see you at the next event!

Best,
[Your Name]
Hot Rod AN"
