# Hot Rodan Return/Warranty Process (Draft)

## Purpose
Document return policy for automotive parts, warranty claim workflows, and procedures for handling fitment issues.

## Return Policy Overview

### Standard Returns
- **Window**: 30 days from delivery
- **Condition**: Unused, original packaging, with all hardware/documentation
- **Restocking Fee**: 15% on non-defective returns
- **Shipping**: Customer pays return shipping unless defective

### Non-Returnable Items
- Special order/custom parts
- Electrical components once installed
- Opened fluids, sealants, chemicals
- Parts with core charges (unless core returned)

## Return Process

### Step 1: Customer Initiates Return
1. Customer contacts support within 30-day window
2. Provide order number, item SKU, reason for return
3. Verify item is returnable (check non-returnable list)
4. Confirm condition (unused, packaging intact)

### Step 2: Issue RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization)
1. Generate RMA number in system
2. Email RMA instructions to customer:
   - Return address
   - RMA number (must be on package)
   - Packing instructions
   - Expected refund timeline
3. Set expectation: "Refund processed within 3-5 business days of receiving item"

### Step 3: Receive & Process Return
1. Inspect returned item against RMA notes
2. Verify condition matches customer description
3. If acceptable: Process refund (original payment method)
4. If issues: Contact customer before processing (damage, missing parts, etc.)

### Return Reasons & Actions

#### Fitment Issue (Wrong Part for Application)
**Customer**: "This doesn't fit my car"
1. Verify application details (year, make, model, engine)
2. Cross-check part specs vs. vehicle compatibility
3. Determine if:
   - Incorrect part ordered → Standard return/exchange
   - Correct part but needs adapter → Offer adapter sale
   - Compatibility issue not listed → Escalate to product team
4. Offer exchange for correct part (waive restocking if our error)

#### Defective/Damaged on Arrival
1. Request photos of damage/defect
2. Verify shipping carrier and packaging
3. If shipping damage: File carrier claim, expedite replacement
4. If manufacturing defect: Process warranty claim (see below)
5. Expedite replacement at no cost to customer

#### Changed Mind/No Longer Needed
1. Verify return window and condition
2. Issue RMA with 15% restocking fee notice
3. Process per standard return policy
4. Offer store credit option to waive restocking fee

## Warranty Process

### Warranty Coverage
- **Standard Parts**: 90 days to 1 year (varies by manufacturer)
- **Racing/Competition Parts**: Often limited or no warranty (check specs)
- **Labor**: Not covered
- **Consequential Damages**: Not covered

### Warranty Claim Steps

#### Step 1: Determine Eligibility
1. Check purchase date (within warranty period?)
2. Verify failure type:
   - Manufacturing defect → Covered
   - Normal wear → Not covered
   - Installation error → Not covered
   - Misuse/abuse → Not covered
3. Request details: How/when did it fail? Installed by professional?

#### Step 2: Document the Issue
1. Request photos/video of failure
2. Ask for installation details (torque specs followed, proper fitment confirmed)
3. For electrical: Verify proper wiring, voltage
4. For fuel system: Check for contamination, proper pressure
5. Document in warranty claim ticket

#### Step 3: Vendor Coordination
1. Contact vendor/manufacturer with claim details
2. Provide customer documentation (photos, install notes)
3. Get vendor decision: Replace, repair, or deny
4. Typical turnaround: 3-7 business days

#### Step 4: Resolution
**If Approved**:
- Vendor ships replacement direct or to us
- We ship to customer at no charge
- Defective part may need to be returned (provide RMA)

**If Denied**:
- Explain reason to customer professionally
- Offer options: Purchase replacement at cost, consider upgrade
- Provide vendor contact if customer wants to appeal

### Common Warranty Scenarios

#### Leaking AN Fitting
1. Verify proper installation (torque, sealant use)
2. Check for cross-threading or damage
3. If installation correct and part defective → Warranty claim
4. If installation error → Offer replacement at cost, provide install guide

#### Failed Fuel Pump
1. Determine failure mode (won't run, low pressure, noisy)
2. Check installation (wiring correct, voltage adequate, filter clean)
3. Verify fuel contamination not present
4. If installation and conditions correct → Warranty claim

#### Carburetor Issues
1. Identify symptom (flooding, lean, won't idle)
2. Verify jetting, float level, power valve settings
3. Check for debris, gasket leaks
4. If tuning/setup issue → Refer to tech support, not warranty
5. If internal defect (warped body, bad casting) → Warranty claim

## Fitment Issues - Deep Dive

### Common Fitment Problems

#### Headers Don't Clear Chassis
1. Verify customer has correct application (steering, motor mounts, chassis mods)
2. Check for known clearance issues with this combo
3. Options: Return, try different brand, custom modification (not covered)

#### AN Fittings Don't Match Threads
1. Identify thread type (AN vs. NPT vs. metric)
2. Offer adapter fittings
3. If wrong part shipped → Free exchange
4. If customer ordered wrong → Standard return with restocking fee (or offer adapter)

#### Wrong Bolt Pattern/Mounting
1. Verify vehicle specs and part specs
2. Check for updates/revisions to part design
3. Options: Return, use adapter plates, machine new holes (customer cost)

### Escalation: Complex Fitment
**When to Escalate to Tech Specialist**:
- Multiple compatibility questions beyond basic check
- Custom engine swaps or non-standard applications
- Racing/competition setups with unique requirements
- Conflicting information in application charts

## Return/Warranty Metrics

### Track and Report
- Return rate by product category
- Warranty claim rate by vendor
- Fitment issue frequency (top problem parts)
- Time to resolution (target: <3 days)

### Use Data For
- Product page improvements (better fitment notes)
- Vendor quality discussions (high warranty rate)
- Buying decisions (stop carrying problem parts)
- FAQ and knowledge base updates
