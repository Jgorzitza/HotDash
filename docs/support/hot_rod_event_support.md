## Event Support Workflows

### Pre-Event (1-2 Weeks Out)

#### Identify Major Events
- Monitor racing calendars (NHRA, NMCA, local tracks)
- Track car show schedules (major shows in Hot Rodan regions)
- Note customer mentions ("I'm racing at X next weekend")

#### Prepare Support Team
- Brief team on event details (location, dates, type)
- Assign dedicated event support contact
- Stock up on likely needed parts (based on event type)
- Prep shipping options (overnight to track, will-call, etc.)

#### Proactive Customer Outreach
```
Subject: Racing at [Event] this weekend? We've got you covered!

Hey [Hot Rodan Customer] -

We see [Event Name] is coming up this weekend. If you're heading out there:

üîß Last-minute parts? Order by Friday 12 PM for Saturday track delivery
üìû Emergency support? Call/text [event hotline] during the event
üèÅ Need tech help? Our specialist [Name] is on standby

Good luck and safe racing!

[Team]
```

### During Event (Real-Time Support)

#### Event Hotline Activation
- Dedicated phone line or agent for event duration
- Extended hours (cover practice/race days)
- Fast response commitment (30 min callback)

#### Emergency Part Orders
**Process**:
1. Identify need and urgency ("What broke? When do you need it?")
2. Check stock and shipping options
3. Coordinate delivery:
   - **To track**: Overnight to track address, will-call, or customer hotel
   - **Local pickup**: If Hot Rodan warehouse nearby
   - **Vendor direct**: Contact vendor for track-side delivery (if booth present)
4. Execute and track relentlessly

**Example**:
```
Customer (Saturday AM): "My nitrous solenoid just failed at the track!"

Support Response:
1. "Do you need it for today's race or tomorrow's finals?"
2. "I have the part in stock. I can overnight it to the track for Sunday AM delivery."
3. "Cost: $[part] + $[shipping]. Order now and I'll make sure it gets there."
4. [Process order, notify fulfillment: TRACK EMERGENCY]
5. [Text tracking to customer, follow up Sunday AM]
```

#### Technical Support On-Demand
- Route technical questions to specialists immediately
- Phone support preferred (faster than email)
- Share setup tips, troubleshooting, quick fixes
- Document for future knowledge base

#### On-Site Presence (If Applicable)
If Hot Rodan has vendor booth:
- Staff with product experts (not just order-takers)
- Offer tech consultations at booth
- Have common parts in stock for immediate sale
- Collect contact info for follow-up

### Post-Event (1-3 Days After)

#### Customer Follow-Up
```
