# Seasonal Support Planning (Draft)

## Purpose
Document hot rod racing season patterns, plan for peak demand periods, and establish surge support protocols for Hot Rodan.

## Hot Rod Racing Season Calendar

### Peak Season: Spring/Summer (March-September)
**Driver**: Racing events, car shows, warm weather builds
**Volume Impact**: 2-3x normal support volume
**Common Requests**:
- Rush orders for race weekend repairs
- Pre-event build consultations
- Last-minute part changes
- Technical troubleshooting under time pressure

### Shoulder Season: Fall (October-November)
**Driver**: Off-season upgrades, winter build prep
**Volume Impact**: 1.5x normal volume
**Common Requests**:
- Major build planning (engine swaps, chassis work)
- Bulk orders for winter projects
- Research-heavy inquiries
- Custom part sourcing

### Low Season: Winter (December-February)
**Driver**: Planning phase, fewer active events
**Volume Impact**: Baseline or slightly below
**Common Requests**:
- Holiday gift orders
- Planning consultations for next season
- Educational questions
- Catalog browsing

## Monthly Demand Patterns

### High-Demand Months
- **March**: Season kickoff, pre-season builds
- **April-May**: Event season ramps up
- **June-July**: Peak racing, high urgency orders
- **August**: Late-season maintenance, preparation for finals

### Key Dates & Events
- **Early March**: Spring break prep, first warm weekends
- **Memorial Day Weekend**: Major race events start
- **July 4th Weekend**: Mid-summer racing peak
- **Labor Day Weekend**: Late-season championships
- **Thanksgiving-Christmas**: Gift season, project planning

## Surge Support Protocols

### Tier 1: Moderate Increase (1.5x normal)
**Trigger**: Volume up 50% vs. baseline week
**Response**:
- Extend support hours by 2 hours
- Cross-train team members on overflow handling
- Daily triage meetings to prioritize VIP/urgent
- Monitor CX Escalations tile for SLA breach risk

### Tier 2: High Surge (2x normal)
**Trigger**: Volume doubles vs. baseline
**Response**:
- Activate weekend coverage (Saturday hours)
- Bring in backup operators from other departments
- Implement fast-lane queue for race weekend emergencies
- Escalate non-urgent items to next business day
- Daily manager check-ins on team capacity

### Tier 3: Critical Surge (3x+ normal)
**Trigger**: Major event weekend or system issue
**Response**:
- All-hands support activation
- CEO/leadership direct customer contact for VIP
- Pause non-critical work (training, projects)
- Outsource tier-1 queries if available
- Post-mortem to plan for next occurrence

## Pre-Season Preparation (February-March)

### Staff Readiness
- [ ] Review hot rod terminology refresher (see `hot_rod_industry_training.md`)
- [ ] Update product knowledge on new releases
- [ ] Practice rush order workflows
- [ ] Confirm escalation contacts (fulfillment, tech, sales)
- [ ] Test surge capacity with mock scenarios

### System Readiness
- [ ] Verify OCC tiles and approval queue scaling
- [ ] Confirm stock levels on top 50 products
- [ ] Update expedited shipping cutoff times
- [ ] Test VIP escalation paths end-to-end
- [ ] Prepare canned responses for common surge queries

### Communication Prep
- [ ] Brief team on expected volume increases
- [ ] Set expectations for overtime/weekend coverage
- [ ] Update auto-responders with realistic timelines
- [ ] Prepare proactive customer comms (e.g., "Expect delays during race season")

## Race Weekend Emergency Protocol

### Definition
Customer needs part by Saturday/Sunday for race event

### Response Checklist
1. **Confirm urgency**: "Is this for an event this weekend?"
2. **Check stock**: Verify availability in real-time
3. **Shipping options**: 
   - Overnight (order by 2pm cutoff)
   - Saturday delivery (order by 12pm Friday)
   - Local pickup (if warehouse nearby)
4. **Set expectations**: "I'll personally track this and text you the tracking number"
5. **VIP escalation**: Flag as race emergency in CX tile
6. **Follow-up**: Proactive update Friday PM, Saturday AM if applicable

### Fallback Options
- **Part not in stock**: Offer alternative supplier contact if available
- **Missed cutoff**: Coordinate with fulfillment for exception (manager approval)
- **Weekend support**: Provide emergency contact for tracking issues

## Off-Season Opportunities (December-February)

### Customer Engagement
- Educational content: "Planning your next build?"
- Early bird specials on winter project parts
- Build consultation offers (free 30-min technical review)
- Community engagement: "Show us your winter build progress"

### Team Development
- Deep training on new products and technologies
- Process improvement projects
- Knowledge base expansion
- Cross-training with technical specialists

### Inventory Coordination
- Stock up for spring rush based on prior year data
- Clear slow-movers with promotions
- Coordinate vendor restocks ahead of peak

## Metrics to Monitor

### Leading Indicators (Predict Surge)

- Social media buzz (new builds, event hype)

### Real-Time Metrics (During Surge)
