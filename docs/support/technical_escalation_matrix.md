# Technical Support Escalation Matrix (Draft)

## Purpose
Define when to escalate hot rod technical questions to product experts, routing protocols, and specialist coordination for Hot Rodan support.

## Escalation Tiers

### Tier 1: Support Operators (You)
**Handle**: Product selection, basic fitment, order status, returns, general questions
**Tools**: Product KB, compatibility charts, order system
**Resolution Target**: 80% of inquiries

### Tier 2: Technical Specialists
**Handle**: Complex fitment, performance calculations, build consultations, troubleshooting
**Tools**: Full tech specs, vendor contacts, dyno data, build experience
**Resolution Target**: 15% of inquiries (escalated from Tier 1)

### Tier 3: Vendor/Manufacturer
**Handle**: Warranty claims, defect analysis, custom applications, engineering questions
**Resolution Target**: 5% of inquiries (escalated from Tier 2)

## When to Escalate: Decision Tree

### Stay at Tier 1 (You Handle)
‚úÖ Customer asks: "Do you have this in stock?"
‚úÖ Customer asks: "Will this -6 AN fitting work with my Holley carb?"
‚úÖ Customer asks: "How do I track my order?"
‚úÖ Customer asks: "What's your return policy?"
‚úÖ Customer asks: "Which fuel pump for 500 HP street engine?"

### Escalate to Tier 2 (Technical Specialist)
üîº Customer asks: "I'm building a twin-turbo LS with E85, what fuel system?"
üîº Customer asks: "Headers hit my steering, can we modify the tubes?"
üîº Customer asks: "Calculate jetting for 8000 ft altitude on nitrous"
üîº Customer asks: "My engine surges at cruise, checked A/F ratio, now what?"
üîº Customer says: "I need a complete ignition system for road racing"

### Escalate to Tier 3 (Vendor)
üîºüîº Warranty claim with technical analysis needed
üîºüîº Request for custom part modification or special order >$5K
üîºüîº Engineering question about product design or limits

- Current setup (what's installed now)
- Goal/use case (street, strip, road race, etc.)
- Specific question or problem
- Parts already purchased or considering

### Step 2: Document the Inquiry
Create escalation ticket with:
- **Subject**: [TECH ESC] [Category] - Brief Description
- **Priority**: Standard / Urgent (race weekend) / VIP
- **Customer Info**: Name, email, phone, order history
- **Technical Details**: Vehicle, engine, setup, question
- **Your Assessment**: What you've already verified or ruled out

### Step 3: Route to Specialist
- **Fuel/Nitrous**: Route to [Specialist Name/Email]
- **Ignition/Electrical**: Route to [Specialist Name/Email]
- **Engine/Drivetrain**: Route to [Specialist Name/Email]
- **Exhaust/Headers**: Route to [Specialist Name/Email]
- **General/Multi-category**: Route to Senior Tech Lead

### Step 4: Set Customer Expectations
```
Hi [Name],

Great question! I'm escalating this to our technical specialist [Name] who has deep experience with [category]. 

Expected response: Within 24 hours (or sooner if urgent)

[Specialist] will reach out directly via email or phone. If you need an immediate answer for a race weekend or urgent build, reply and I'll mark it priority.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Step 5: Follow Up
- Track escalation in system
- Check status at 24 hours
- Ping specialist if no response by 48 hours
- Close loop with customer once resolved

## Common Escalation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complex Build Consultation
**Customer**: "Building 383 stroker, Pro-Touring car, what fuel and ignition?"

**Your Response**:
1. Acknowledge: "That's going to be a killer build!"
2. Gather details: "What's your target HP? Street/track split? Carb or EFI?"
3. Escalate: "I'm connecting you with [Tech Specialist] who can design the full fuel and ignition system for your goals."
4. Set expectation: "They'll reach out within 24 hours."

### Scenario 2: Troubleshooting Active Issue
**Customer**: "Engine running rich, changed jets, still rich, what's wrong?"

**Your Response**:
1. Check basics: "Have you verified float level and power valve?"
2. If yes: "This needs some diagnosis. Our tech specialist can walk through it with you."
3. Escalate: Route to specialist with symptom details
4. Offer: "If you need it running ASAP, we can arrange a phone consult."

### Scenario 3: Race Weekend Emergency
**Customer**: "Race Saturday, header cracked, need to know if this will fit by tonight!"

**Your Response**:
1. Check basic fitment: "I can verify application right now."
2. If uncertain: "Let me get our header specialist on this ASAP - stand by 30 min."

## Self-Learning: When NOT to Escalate

### Build Your Knowledge
If you escalate the same question type 3+ times, it's time to learn it yourself:
1. Shadow the specialist on next similar call
2. Ask for training on that topic
3. Document the pattern in personal notes
4. Add to team knowledge base

### Example Learning Path
- Week 1: Escalate all fuel pump sizing ‚Üí Specialist teaches
- Week 2: Handle basic fuel pump sizing, escalate complex ‚Üí Building skills
- Week 3: Handle 80% of fuel pump questions solo ‚Üí Competent
- Week 4: Only escalate truly advanced questions ‚Üí Expert

## Escalation Quality Metrics

### Good Escalation
‚úÖ Complete customer details provided
‚úÖ Clear technical question stated
‚úÖ Relevant background included
‚úÖ Urgency level appropriate
‚úÖ Customer expectations set

### Poor Escalation (Avoid)
‚ùå Incomplete information ("Customer has a question about headers")
‚ùå No context ("Can you help with this?")
‚ùå Wrong tier (simple question to vendor)
‚ùå No urgency flag when race weekend
‚ùå Customer not informed of escalation

## Training & Certification

### Tier 1 ‚Üí Tier 2 Path
To become a Technical Specialist:
1. Master all Tier 1 topics (6-12 months)
2. Shadow specialists on 20+ escalations
3. Co-handle 10+ technical calls with mentor
4. Pass technical assessment (oral exam + written)
5. Handle trial escalations solo with review

### Continuing Education
- Monthly tech training sessions
- Vendor product updates
- Industry trends (EFI, electric, emerging tech)
- Trade show/event participation
