# Quality Issue Handling (Draft)

## Purpose
Define procedures for defective part process, quality claims escalation, and supplier coordination.

## Quality Issue Categories

### Manufacturing Defect
- Part doesn't meet design specs (wrong size, thread pitch, material)
- Visible defects (cracks, porosity, poor finish)
- Functional failure due to manufacturing error
**Cause**: Vendor quality control issue
**Resolution**: Warranty replacement, vendor claim

### Damage in Transit
- Part arrives broken, bent, scratched
- Packaging insufficient or damaged
**Cause**: Shipping carrier handling
**Resolution**: Carrier claim, immediate replacement

### Design Flaw
- Part doesn't work as intended for application
- Performance issue inherent to design
**Cause**: Engineering/design problem
**Resolution**: Vendor escalation, product recall/update

### Installation/User Error
- Part failed due to improper installation
- Part damaged by customer (cross-threading, over-torquing)
**Cause**: Customer mistake
**Resolution**: Not covered, offer replacement at cost

### Normal Wear/Abuse
- Part failed due to age or extreme use
- Racing/competition wear and tear
**Cause**: Expected failure mode
**Resolution**: Not covered (unless within warranty), offer replacement

## Quality Issue Process

### Step 1: Customer Reports Issue

**Initial Contact**:
```
Customer: "This [part] is defective!"

Support Response:
"I'm sorry to hear that. Let's get this figured out right away.

1. What's the issue specifically? (won't work, broke, wrong size, etc.)
2. When did you receive it?
3. Has it been installed? If so, by who?
4. Can you send photos of the issue?"
```

### Step 2: Diagnose the Issue

#### Visual Inspection (via Photos)
- Cracks, breaks, deformation = likely defect
- Surface finish issues (rough, pitting, porosity) = manufacturing issue
- Wrong specs (size, thread, etc.) = wrong part shipped or vendor error

#### Functional Assessment
- Won't hold pressure = seal/gasket issue or design flaw
- Electrical failure = component failure or installation error
- Mechanical failure = material defect, fatigue, or over-stress

#### Installation Review
- Verify proper installation (torque, sealant, wiring, etc.)
- Check for modifications that could cause issue
- Confirm compatible application

### Step 3: Categorize & Route

#### Defect → Warranty Process
1. Confirm within warranty period
2. Verify not caused by installation error or abuse
3. Create warranty claim ticket
4. Route to vendor for approval
5. Process replacement upon vendor OK

#### Damage → Carrier Claim
1. Document damage in photos (part and packaging)
2. File claim with shipping carrier
3. Send replacement immediately (don't wait for claim)
4. Absorb cost if carrier denies (customer satisfaction)

#### Design Flaw → Engineering Escalation
1. Document issue thoroughly (photos, specs, symptoms)
2. Escalate to vendor engineering team
3. Determine if widespread issue (check for pattern)
4. Coordinate solution (redesign, recall, technical bulletin)

#### User Error → Educational Opportunity
1. Explain what went wrong (kindly, not blaming)
2. Provide correct installation guide
3. Offer replacement at cost (show goodwill)
4. Turn into training moment (prevent future issues)

### Step 4: Resolution & Follow-Up

#### Defect Resolution
```
"Good news - the vendor approved the warranty claim. We're shipping a replacement today at no cost.

Replacement tracking: [link]
Expected delivery: [date]

Return the defective part using this RMA: [number]

Sorry for the inconvenience. If the replacement has any issues, let me know immediately."
```

#### Damage Resolution
```
"I see the part arrived damaged. That's on us - we'll send a replacement right away.

Replacement ships today, tracking: [link]
No need to return the damaged part.

If you need it urgently, I can upgrade to overnight at no charge. Just say the word."
```

#### Design Flaw Resolution
```
"We've identified an issue with this batch of [part]. The vendor is issuing an updated version.

Here's what we're doing:
1. Sending you the updated part (ships [date])
2. Full refund if you prefer
3. Discount on future orders as apology

This affects other customers too, so we're being proactive. Thanks for bringing it to our attention."
```

#### User Error Resolution
```
"It looks like the part was cross-threaded during installation, which damaged the threads.

This isn't covered by warranty, but I can offer:
1. Replacement at 50% off (our cost)
2. Installation guide to prevent this next time
3. Tip: Use anti-seize on threads and torque to spec

Want to grab the replacement? I can rush ship it if needed."
```

## Vendor Coordination

### Submitting Quality Claims

#### Information to Gather
- Customer name and order number
- Part number and description
- Date of purchase and date of failure
- Detailed issue description
- Photos of defect (multiple angles)
- Installation details (who, how, torque, etc.)
- Application details (vehicle, engine, use case)

#### Claim Submission
```
To: [Vendor Quality Team]
Subject: Warranty Claim - [Part Number] - [Issue Summary]

Claim Details:
- Part: [SKU/Description]
- Vendor PN: [If different]
- Purchase Date: [Date]
- Failure Date: [Date]
- Customer: [Name, Order #]

Issue Description:
[Detailed explanation of defect/failure]

Evidence:
[Attach photos, videos, measurements]

Installation:
[Professional or DIY, proper torque, correct application]

Request: Warranty replacement under [X] day/year warranty

Please advise authorization for replacement.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
Hot Rodan Support
```

#### Vendor Response Timeline
- **Standard**: 3-5 business days
- **Urgent (race weekend, VIP)**: Same day (call vendor directly)
- **Complex (engineering needed)**: 7-10 business days

### Tracking Quality Patterns

#### Red Flags (Escalate Immediately)
- Same part fails repeatedly (3+ in short period)
- Safety-critical failure (brakes, fuel, steering)
- Batch/lot issue (all from same production run)
- Customer injury or property damage

#### Quality Tracking Log
Maintain spreadsheet:
- Part number
- Issue type (defect, damage, design flaw, etc.)
- Vendor
- Frequency (how many reports)
- Resolution (warranty, refund, recall)
- Status (open, closed, escalated)

#### Monthly Quality Review
- Identify top problem parts
- Discuss with vendors (why so many issues?)
- Consider alternative suppliers
- Update product pages (known issues, solutions)

## Proactive Quality Management

### Pre-Sale Quality Checks

**New Product Vetting**:
1. Test sample before stocking
2. Review vendor quality history
3. Check community feedback (forums, reviews)
4. Verify specs match description

**High-Risk Categories**:
- Electrical components (failure-prone)
- Chinese imports (quality variability)
- First production runs (bugs not worked out)
- Racing/high-stress parts (abuse potential)

### Customer Education

**Prevent Issues**:
- Installation guides on product pages
- Video tutorials for complex installs
- Torque specs and critical notes
- Application warnings (not for X use)

**Set Expectations**:
- Racing parts: "Competition use voids warranty"
- Wear items: "Expected lifespan: X hours/miles"
- Fitment notes: "May require [modification] for [application]"

### Feedback Loop

**Quality → Product Team**:
- Share quality data monthly
- Recommend dropping problem suppliers
- Suggest product improvements
- Flag misrepresented products (description doesn't match reality)

**Quality → Vendor**:
- Quarterly quality review with suppliers
- Share customer feedback (anonymized)
- Negotiate improvements or stop carrying
- Request updated products (v2, redesign)

## Quality Issue Communication

### Setting Expectations

**Warranty Timeline**:
```
"Warranty claims typically take 3-5 business days for vendor approval. 

I'll check in daily and keep you posted. If approved, replacement ships same day.

Need it sooner? I can send a replacement at cost today and refund you if warranty is approved. Your call."
```

**Uncertain Outcome**:
```
"I'm submitting this to the vendor for review. They'll determine if it's covered.

If approved → Free replacement
If denied → I'll explain why and offer options

I should hear back by [date]. I'll update you as soon as I know."
```

### Managing Denials

**Vendor Denies Warranty**:
```
"The vendor reviewed the claim and determined [reason for denial].

Here's why:
[Explain in customer terms - installation error, outside warranty, abuse, etc.]

I know this isn't the answer you wanted. Here's what I can do:
1. Replacement at 30% off (best I can offer)
2. Alternative part that might work better for your use
3. Escalate to vendor manager if you disagree (no guarantees)

What makes sense for you?"
```

### Turning Negative into Positive

**Over-Deliver on Service**:
- Respond fast (< 1 hour for quality issues)
- Replacement ships same day (don't wait for vendor)
- Upgrade shipping at no charge
- Throw in extra (discount code, free part, swag)

**Example**:
```
"I'm really sorry this part failed. That's not the Hot Rodan experience we want you to have.

Here's what I'm doing:
✅ Replacement ships today (overnight at no charge)
✅ $25 credit for your next order
✅ Personal follow-up call to make sure it's working

We'll make this right. You have my word."
```
