# Hot Rodan Product Knowledge Base (Draft)

## Purpose
Quick reference for Hot Rodan's top-selling products, common customer questions, and direct links to product pages.

## Top-Selling Product Categories

### 1. AN Fittings & Fuel Line Components
**Common SKUs** (examples - update with actual top sellers):
- AN-6 Straight Fittings (aluminum, stainless)
- AN-8 90-Degree Fittings
- Braided Stainless Fuel Line Kits
- Fuel Line End Fittings

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What size AN fitting for my carburetor?
  - A: Most Holley carbs use -6 or -8 AN inlets; check carb specs or measure existing fitting
- Q: Aluminum or stainless fittings?
  - A: Aluminum = lighter, common for race; Stainless = more durable, higher heat resistance
- Q: How to prevent leaks?
  - A: Proper torque (follow spec sheet), Teflon tape or sealant on NPT threads only (not AN)

- Fuel Line Kits: www.hotrodan.com/fuel-line-kits

### 2. Ignition Components
**Common SKUs**:
- Distributors (GM, Ford, Mopar applications)
- Ignition Coils (high-performance, racing)
- Spark Plug Wires (8mm, 10mm)
- Electronic Ignition Conversion Kits

**Common Questions**:
- Q: Which distributor for my engine?
  - A: Depends on block (SBC, BBC, SBF, etc.) and application (street, strip); verify part number compatibility
- Q: Do I need a coil upgrade?
  - A: High-compression or boosted engines benefit; match coil to ignition system specs
- Q: Plug wire routing for headers?
  - A: Use heat-resistant separators; route away from exhaust; consider ceramic boots

### 3. Carburetor & Fuel System
**Common SKUs**:
- Holley Carburetors (600, 750, 850 CFM)
- Fuel Pumps (mechanical, electric)
- Fuel Pressure Regulators
- Nitrous System Components

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What CFM carburetor do I need?
  - A: Calculate: (CID × RPM × VE) / 3456; street engines typically 600-750 CFM
- Q: Electric or mechanical fuel pump?
  - A: Electric = consistent pressure, easier install; Mechanical = simpler, no wiring
- Q: Fuel pressure for carb vs. EFI?
  - A: Carb: 5-7 PSI; EFI: 40-60 PSI (verify system specs)

### 4. Performance Engine Components
**Common SKUs**:
- Cylinder Heads (aluminum, cast iron)
- Intake Manifolds (single-plane, dual-plane)
- Camshafts & Valvetrain
- Stroker Kits

**Common Questions**:
- Q: Aluminum or cast iron heads?
  - A: Aluminum = lighter, better heat dissipation, higher cost; Cast = budget-friendly, street use
- Q: Single-plane or dual-plane intake?
  - A: Single = high-RPM power, race; Dual = low-end torque, street
- Q: Cam selection for my build?
  - A: Requires engine specs (compression, heads, usage); route to tech specialist

**Product Links**:
- Cylinder Heads: www.hotrodan.com/cylinder-heads
- Intake Manifolds: www.hotrodan.com/intake-manifolds

### 5. Exhaust & Headers
**Common SKUs**:
- Headers (coated, raw steel, stainless)
- Collector Extensions
- Exhaust Gaskets & Hardware
- Merge Collectors

**Common Questions**:
- Q: Coated or uncoated headers?
  - A: Coated = corrosion protection, heat reduction; Uncoated = budget option, can coat later
- Q: Primary tube size?
  - A: Depends on HP and application; larger = more top-end, smaller = better low-end
- Q: Fitment with my chassis?
  - A: Verify application notes; provide year/make/model for confirmation
