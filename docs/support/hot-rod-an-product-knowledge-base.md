## ‚ùì Common Product Questions & Answers

### Q: "What's the difference between aluminum and stainless?"

**A**:
```
Aluminum:
‚Ä¢ Lighter weight
‚Ä¢ Less expensive
‚Ä¢ Anodized color options (blue, red, black)
‚Ä¢ Softer (easier to scratch)
‚Ä¢ Perfect for street/strip

Stainless Steel:
‚Ä¢ Heavier
‚Ä¢ More expensive
‚Ä¢ Natural silver finish
‚Ä¢ More durable (harder to damage)
‚Ä¢ Best for full race cars (extreme conditions)

Recommendation:
‚Ä¢ Most hot rods: Aluminum (lighter, looks great, affordable)
‚Ä¢ Full race cars: Stainless (maximum durability)
```

---

### Q: "Can I reuse AN fittings?"

**A**:
```
Yes! AN fittings are designed to be reusable.

Guidelines:
‚Ä¢ Inspect flare before each reuse (should be smooth, no scratches)
‚Ä¢ Clean thoroughly (brake cleaner)
‚Ä¢ Replace after 3-5 disassembly cycles (preventive maintenance)
‚Ä¢ If flare is damaged: Replace immediately (can't be repaired)

Reusable benefits:
‚Ä¢ Save money (don't buy new every time)
‚Ä¢ Adjust routing as needed
‚Ä¢ Move to different projects
```

### Q: "Do I need braided hose or can I use rubber?"

**A**:
```
Both work, but braided is better:

Braided Stainless:
‚úÖ Ethanol-resistant (E10/E15 fuel)
‚úÖ Professional appearance
‚úÖ Lifetime durability (10+ years)
‚úÖ Handles high pressure
‚ùå More expensive

Rubber Hose (Ethanol-compatible):
‚úÖ Less expensive
‚úÖ Flexible (easier to route)
‚úÖ Quieter (no rattles)
‚ùå Degrades over time (5-7 years)
‚ùå Looks less professional

Recommendation:
‚Ä¢ Hot rods, show cars: Braided (looks amazing)
‚Ä¢ Budget builds, work trucks: Ethanol-compatible rubber
```
