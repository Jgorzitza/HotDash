# Operator Feedback Collection System (Draft)

## Goal
Collect structured operator feedback during the pilot to drive actionable improvements.

## Components
- Weekly survey (Google Form or internal form) — 5 questions
- Weekly 30-minute interview — capture notes and screenshots
- Evidence repository — `artifacts/support/feedback/` (dated folders)

## Survey Template (5 Questions)
1. Which tiles did you use this week? (multi-select)
2. What was most useful? (free text)
3. What was confusing or missing? (free text)
4. Any errors or unexpected behavior? (free text)
5. What one improvement would have saved you the most time? (free text)

## Interview Guide (30 Minutes)
1. Walkthrough: Show how you used OCC this week
2. Deep dive on one workflow (e.g., CX Escalations)
3. Capture any blockers and edge cases
4. Prioritize top requested improvement

## Evidence Handling
- Store screenshots and notes under `artifacts/support/feedback/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`
- Reference decision IDs, tile names, and request IDs where possible
- Summarize findings weekly in `feedback/support.md`

## Analysis & Loop
- Aggregate themes weekly (top 3 issues, top 3 wins)
- Open tickets with evidence links
- Review with Product/Engineer; update SOPs and direction docs as needed
