Define procedures for shop/fleet orders (multi-vehicle), volume pricing inquiries, and business account setup.

## B2B Customer Types

### Professional Shops
- Install shops (general automotive, performance)
- Speed shops (parts + builds)
- Race shops (dedicated competition)
**Needs**: Bulk pricing, regular orders, technical support, fast turnaround

### Racing Teams

- Road racing teams (endurance, series racing)
- Off-road teams
**Needs**: Contingency support, emergency orders, trackside delivery, sponsorship

### Fleet Operators

- Event companies (car shows, festivals)
**Needs**: Maintenance parts, volume orders, predictable delivery

### Resellers/Distributors
- Local parts stores

**Needs**: Wholesale pricing, dropship capability, MAP policy clarity

## Bulk Order Process

### Step 1: Qualify the Inquiry

**Questions to Ask**:
1. "What type of business are you? (shop, team, fleet, reseller)"
2. "How many units/vehicles are you ordering for?"
3. "Is this a one-time order or recurring need?"
4. "What's your typical monthly purchase volume?"
5. "Do you have a business tax ID / resale certificate?"

### Step 2: Volume Pricing Tiers

#### Standard Bulk Discount (No Account)
- 5-10 units: 10% off
- 11-25 units: 15% off
- 26-50 units: 20% off
- 51+ units: 25% off (or quote custom)

**Process**:
```
"For [quantity] units, I can offer [X%] off. 

Base price: $[X] each
Bulk price: $[Y] each
Total: $[Z]

Sound good? I can get this processed right away."
```

#### Business Account Pricing (Recurring)
- Silver (< $5K/mo): 15% off all orders
- Gold ($5-15K/mo): 20% off + free shipping
- Platinum (> $15K/mo): 25% off + free shipping + dedicated rep

**Process**:
1. Collect business info (name, address, tax ID)
2. Set up account in system with pricing tier
3. Assign account manager (if Gold/Platinum)
4. Provide account number and ordering instructions

### Step 3: Order Execution

#### Single Bulk Order
1. Verify stock for full quantity
2. Apply volume discount
3. Coordinate shipping:
   - **Single location**: Standard or freight (if heavy/large)
   - **Multiple locations**: Split shipment (add logistics cost)
4. Provide tracking for all shipments
5. Follow up post-delivery

#### Recurring Orders
1. Set up standing order (e.g., "100 units every month")
2. Auto-ship on schedule or manual trigger
3. Volume pricing locked in for term (e.g., 6 or 12 months)
4. Quarterly review to adjust quantity/pricing
