## 💰 High-Dollar Order Escalation Paths

### Orders Over $5,000 (Escalate to Manager)

**Why Escalate**:
- Large orders have high stakes (customer AND us)
- May qualify for volume discount
- Ensure accuracy (mistakes are expensive)
- Opportunity for relationship building

**Escalation Process**:
```
1. Identify high-value order: Customer cart >$5,000
2. Tag ticket: [HIGH-VALUE ORDER]
3. Notify manager immediately (Slack or email)
4. Don't quote pricing yet (manager may offer discount)
5. Manager reviews and responds directly to customer

Manager decision:
• Offer volume discount (10-15% for >$5K)
• Assign account manager
• Verify order accuracy
• Arrange special shipping/terms if needed
```

**Customer Communication** (While Escalating):
```
"Hi [Name],

That's a significant order! I want to make sure you get the best
possible pricing and service.

I'm connecting you with our manager who handles high-value orders.
They'll reach out within 1 hour to discuss:
• Volume pricing options
• Shipping arrangements
• Technical support
• Account management

They'll take great care of you!

Best,
[Your Name]"
```

---

### Orders Over $2,500 (Flag for Review)

**Process**:
```
1. Flag ticket: [LARGE ORDER]
2. Verify order accuracy carefully:
   • Part numbers correct?
   • Quantities make sense?
   • Customer understands what they're ordering?
3. Process normally
4. Manager reviews post-order (within 24 hours)
5. Manager may reach out to customer: "Thanks for the large order!"
```

**Why Review**:
- Catch mistakes before shipping ($2,500 return = expensive)
- Build relationship (personal touch)
- Identify shop/fleet accounts (for future VIP treatment)
