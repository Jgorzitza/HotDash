## 🔍 Tracking & Delivery Support

### Tracking Inquiries

**Customer**: *"Where's my order?"*

**Your Process**:
```
Step 1: Look up order
"Let me check your order #[number]..."

Step 2: Provide status
"Your order shipped on [date]:
• Carrier: UPS
• Tracking: [number]
• Current Status: [In transit/Out for delivery/Delivered]
• Expected Delivery: [Date]"

Step 3: Provide tracking link
"Track it here: [URL]

You can also download the UPS app for real-time updates!"
```

**Common Statuses**:
- **Label Created**: We've printed label, awaiting carrier pickup
- **In Transit**: Package is moving toward you
- **Out for Delivery**: Will arrive today
- **Delivered**: Signed for and received
- **Exception**: Delay or issue (see below)

---

### Delivery Delays

**Customer**: *"My package was supposed to arrive yesterday. Where is it?"*

**Common Delay Reasons**:
- Weather (storms, snow)
- Carrier volume (peak season)
- Address issue (wrong/incomplete)
- Signature required (no one home)
- Customs (if international)

**Your Response**:
```
"I see your package is delayed. Here's what's happening:

Tracking shows: [Specific status message]
Reason: [Weather/Volume/Address/etc.]
New Expected Delivery: [Updated date]

[If significant delay]
Would you like me to:
• Contact the carrier to expedite
• Reship a new order overnight (you keep both when original arrives)
• Refund and you can reorder

What works best for your timeline?"
```

**Replacement Shipment** (For Significant Delays):
- If original is 3+ days late AND customer has urgent need
- Ship replacement overnight (free)
- Customer keeps both shipments when first arrives (goodwill)
- Requires manager approval for >$100 value

---

### Lost Packages

**Customer**: *"Tracking shows delivered but I never received it."*

**Investigation Process**:
```
Step 1: Verify delivery details
"Tracking shows delivered on [date] at [time] to [address].
Is that your correct address?"

Step 2: Check delivery location
"The carrier notes say: '[Front door / Mailbox / etc.]'

Can you check:
• Front porch / back door
• Garage / side entrance  
• With neighbors (misdelivery?)
• Building office (if apartment/condo)"

Step 3: If truly missing
"If you've checked everywhere and can't find it, we'll need to:
1. File a claim with [Carrier]
2. Investigate with carrier (2-3 business days)
3. Meanwhile, I'll ship a replacement immediately (free)

You shouldn't have to wait. Replacement ships today!"
```

**Lost Package Policy**:
- Replacement ships immediately (don't wait for carrier investigation)
- Customer not responsible (we filed claim)
- Carrier reimburses us (not customer's problem)

---

### Damaged in Shipping

**Customer**: *"Package arrived but fitting is bent/broken."*

**Process**:
```
"I'm sorry it arrived damaged! That shouldn't happen.

Can you send me photos of:
• The damaged part
• The packaging (outside box)
• Packing materials (how it was packed)

This helps us file a claim with the carrier and improve our packing.

Meanwhile, I'm shipping a replacement today (free, overnight if you
need it urgently).

You can keep or dispose of the damaged part - no need to return it."
```

**Why We Don't Require Return for Shipping Damage**:
- Customer convenience (they shouldn't suffer for carrier mistake)
- Carrier claim process (we handle with carrier)
- Goodwill (exceed expectations)

---

## 🌍 International Shipping (If Applicable)

### Customs & Duties

**Customer**: *"Do I have to pay customs fees?"*

**Your Response**:
```
"For international shipments:

Shipping Cost: What you paid us (covers shipping only)
Customs/Duties: Separate fee charged by your country

Your country's customs may charge:
• Import duty (varies by country)
• VAT/GST (sales tax)
• Customs clearance fee

These fees are:
• Collected by carrier upon delivery
• NOT included in our shipping cost
• Required by your country (we don't receive them)

Typical total: 15-30% of order value (varies by country)

We declare accurate value (required by law). Under-declaring is
illegal and causes customs issues!"
```

**Customs Delays**:
- Normal: 2-5 business days
- Holidays: 5-10 business days
- Inspections: 10+ business days (rare)

## 📞 Carrier Issues

### Contacting Carrier on Customer's Behalf

**When to Contact Carrier**:
- Package significantly delayed (3+ days past expected)
- Lost package investigation
- Delivery exception (address issue, signature needed)
- Customs clearance problem (international)

**Process**:
```
1. Get customer authorization
   "I can contact UPS on your behalf. Is that okay?"
   
2. Call carrier with tracking number
   "This is Hot Rod AN calling about tracking #[number]..."
   
3. Get update from carrier
   - New delivery date

4. Report back to customer
   "I spoke with UPS. Here's the update: [info]"
```
