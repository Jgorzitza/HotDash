---

## 🔄 Return Process (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Understand Why Customer Wants to Return

**Don't Immediately Process Return** — Ask Questions First!

**Discovery Questions**:
1. "What made you decide to return this?"
2. "Did you try installing it?"
3. "Is there an issue with the part, or did you order the wrong size?"
4. "What are you trying to accomplish? Maybe I can help."

**Common Scenarios**:

#### Scenario A: Wrong Size Ordered
```
Customer: "I need to return these AN-6 fittings. I needed AN-8."

✅ Your Response:
"No problem! Before we process the return, let me make sure AN-8
is what you need.

What's your engine HP and fuel hose size?

[Customer answers: 500 HP, 1/2" hose]

Perfect! Yes, AN-8 is correct for 500 HP with 1/2" hose.

I can process an exchange:
• Return your AN-6 fittings (we'll send prepaid label)
• Ship AN-8 fittings today
• You get correct parts faster!

Should I process the exchange?"
```

**Why This Approach**:
- Verifies they need the right size (maybe they're wrong about needing AN-8!)
- Offers exchange (faster than return + reorder)
- Helps customer get to their goal (complete project)

---

#### Scenario B: Part Doesn't Fit
```
Customer: "This fitting doesn't fit my carburetor. I want a return."

✅ Your Response:
"I'm sorry it's not fitting! Let's figure out why—I bet we can
get you the right part.

What carburetor do you have? (Holley, Edelbrock, etc.)

[Customer answers: Holley 750 CFM]

Okay, and what does the inlet look like?
• Straight threads with O-ring groove? (ORB)
• Tapered threads? (NPT)
• 37° flare cone? (AN)

[Customer sends photo or describes]

Ah, I see! Your Holley has 1/2"-20 NPT inlets. You need an
AN-6 to NPT adapter, not a straight AN fitting.

I can send you the correct adapters and you can return the
wrong parts. Sound good?"
```

**Why This Approach**:
- Diagnoses the real problem (wrong part type)
- Educates customer (NPT vs AN)
- Gets them the RIGHT parts (prevents another return)

---

#### Scenario C: Just Changed Mind
```
Customer: "I decided not to do this project. Need to return everything."

✅ Your Response:
"Totally understand—projects change! I can process your return.

Since everything is unopened, here's what happens:
1. I'll email you a prepaid return label
2. Pack items in original boxes
3. Drop off at any UPS location
4. Refund processes within 3-5 business days after we receive

Is there anything else you're working on that we can help with?
Sometimes builders shelve one project and start another!"
```

**Why This Approach**:
- Process return smoothly (don't argue)
- Clear expectations (refund timeline)
- Maintain relationship (offer help on future projects)

---

### Step 2: Process Return or Exchange

**Return Authorization** (RMA):
```
1. Create RMA in system
   - RMA #: [Auto-generated]
   - Customer: [Name]
   - Order #: [Original order]
   - Items: [List of parts being returned]
   - Reason: [Customer's reason]

2. Email prepaid return label
   - Carrier: UPS (standard)
   - Customer prints label
   - Attaches to package

3. Set expectations
   - Refund: 3-5 business days after receipt
   - Inspection: We verify condition when received
   - Notification: Email when refund processes
```

**Exchange Process** (Faster):
```
1. Ship correct parts TODAY
2. Include prepaid label for wrong parts
3. Customer receives correct parts faster
4. Returns wrong parts at convenience

Benefits:
• Customer gets correct parts immediately
• No wait for refund + reorder
• Better customer experience
```

---

### Step 3: Inspect Returned Items

**When Items Arrive**:
```
Quality Check:
☐ Still in original packaging?
☐ New/unused condition?
☐ All pieces present?
☐ No damage?

If YES to all:
→ Process full refund

If NO (used, damaged, missing pieces):
→ Document with photos
→ Contact customer
→ Offer partial refund or store credit
```

**Exceptions** (Manager Approval):
- Customer damaged during installation (partial refund?)
- Beyond 30 days but extenuating circumstances
- High-value customer (process return as goodwill)

---

## 🛠️ Warranty Claims

### Identifying Warranty vs Return

**Return**: Customer doesn't want the part (wrong size, changed mind, etc.)  
**Warranty**: Part is defective or failed

**Warranty Indicators**:
- Part broke during normal use
- Crack or material failure
- Threads stripped during normal installation
- Flare damaged (not from over-tightening)

**Installation Damage** (NOT WARRANTY):
- Cross-threaded (customer forced it)
- Over-tightened (crushed flare)
- Scratched finish (tool damage)
- Modified or altered

---

### Warranty Claim Process

**Step 1: Gather Information**
```
Questions to Ask:
1. "How long have you had this part?"
2. "Did it fail during installation or after use?"
3. "Can you describe what happened?"
4. "Can you send a photo of the damage?"
```

**Step 2: Assess Claim**
```
Valid Warranty:
• Crack in fitting body (material defect)
• Threads stripped during hand-tightening (defect)
• Flare damaged (not from over-tightening)
• Part failed during normal use

Not Warranty (Installation Damage):
• Cross-threaded (customer forced)
• Over-tightened (excessive torque)
• Scratched (tool marks)
• Dropped/impacted

If Uncertain:
• Request photos
• Escalate to manager
• Err on side of customer (benefit of doubt)
```

**Step 3: Process Warranty Replacement**
```
1. Ship replacement part immediately (free shipping)
2. Include prepaid label for defective part
3. Customer keeps broken part until replacement arrives
4. Returns broken part when convenient

No charge to customer:
• Replacement part: FREE
• Shipping: FREE
• No questions asked (if valid warranty)
```

---

### Edge Cases & Judgment Calls

**Case 1: Customer Admits Over-Tightening**
```
Customer: "I tightened it too much and crushed the flare. Can I return it?"

Technically: NOT warranty (customer damage)

✅ Goodwill Response:
"I appreciate your honesty! Over-tightening is really common with
first-time AN fitting users.

Here's what I can do:
• Send a replacement fitting at 50% off (goodwill)
• Include a torque spec guide (prevent it next time)
• No return needed (keep the damaged one as learning experience)

Total: $[half price] including shipping

This way you get the right part and learn the proper technique!"
```

**Why**: Builds loyalty, educates customer, reasonable compromise

**Requires**: Manager approval for 50% discount

---

**Case 2: Part Worked Fine, Then Failed After 2 Years**
```
Customer: "I've used these fittings for 2 years, no issues. Suddenly one cracked. Is that warranty?"

Technically: Maybe (normal wear vs defect?)

✅ Response:
"After 2 years of reliable use, a crack suggests material defect.
Our fittings should last way longer than that!

I'd like to replace it under warranty, no charge. Can you send me
a photo of the crack?

[Customer sends photo showing clear crack, not installation damage]

That's definitely a defect. I'm shipping a replacement today (free).
You should get it in 3-5 days.

Sorry this happened—not typical of our products!"
```

**Why**: Lifetime warranty means lifetime. Build trust, customer becomes advocate.

---

**Case 3: Racing Damage**
```
Customer: "My car crashed at the track and the AN fitting broke. Can you warranty it?"

Technically: NOT warranty (crash damage, not defect)

✅ Response:
"Ouch! Sorry to hear about the crash. Hope you're okay!

Unfortunately, crash damage isn't covered under warranty
(racing conditions are extreme). 

But I want to get you back on track! Here's what I can do:
• 20% discount on replacement parts (racer support!)
• Free overnight shipping if you order today
• Rush processing (you're probably fixing the car ASAP)

What parts do you need to get back racing?

Stay safe out there!"
```

**Why**: Shows empathy, offers compromise, maintains relationship

**Requires**: Manager approval for 20% racer discount

## 🚫 Dealing with Fitment Issues

### Common Fitment Problems

**Problem 1: "This doesn't fit my car!"**

**Often Means**: Wrong adapter, not wrong fitting

**Your Approach**:
```
1. Diagnose what they're connecting to
   "What component are you trying to connect to?"
   
2. Identify port type
   "Can you describe or photo the port?"
   
3. Recommend correct adapter
   "You need an AN-6 to 1/4" NPT adapter for that Holley carb"
   
4. Offer solution
   "I'll send you the correct adapters. Keep the AN fittings
    (you'll use those too). Just need to add the adapters."
```

**Result**: Problem solved, no return needed, customer happy!

---

**Problem 2: "I ordered the wrong size for my hose!"**

**Your Approach**:
```
1. Verify what they actually need
   "What size is your hose? (measure inside diameter)"
   
2. Confirm correct AN size
   "3/8" = AN-6, you're right about needing to exchange"
   
3. Process exchange
   "I'll ship AN-6 fittings today, include prepaid label
    for the AN-8s you received"
```

---

## 📞 Difficult Return Situations

### Situation 1: Beyond 30-Day Window

**Customer**: *"I ordered these 45 days ago but just opened the box. Can I still return?"*

**Policy**: 30 days from delivery (not from opening box)

**Your Response**:
```
"I understand the frustration! Our policy is 30 days from delivery,
which was [date - 45 days ago].

However, I want to help you out. A couple options:

Option 1: Store Credit
• I can offer store credit for the full amount
• Use toward the correct parts or future orders
• No expiration date

Option 2: Manager Exception
• I can ask my manager to approve the return
• Not guaranteed, but I'll advocate for you
• Response within 24 hours

Which would you prefer?"
```

**Escalate to Manager**: Tag [POLICY EXCEPTION] for final decision

---

### Situation 2: Damaged in Shipping

**Customer**: *"The fitting arrived scratched/bent. Can I return it?"*

**This Is Our Fault** (Shipping damage)

**Your Response**:
```
"I'm really sorry that arrived damaged! That's on us.

Here's what we'll do:
• Replacement ships today (free overnight if you need it)
• Keep or dispose of damaged fitting (no return needed)
• No charge for replacement or shipping

You should never receive damaged parts. My apologies!

Do you need it overnight for a deadline, or is standard shipping okay?"
```

**Why**: Our responsibility, make it right immediately, exceed expectations

---

### Situation 3: Used Parts Return Request

**Customer**: *"I installed these but they don't work. Can I return them?"*

**Policy**: Used parts not returnable (unless defective)

**Your Approach**:
```
1. Diagnose first:
   "Let's troubleshoot before we talk returns. What's not working?"
   
2. Identify issue:
   [Walk through troubleshooting playbook]
   
3. Three outcomes:
   
   A) Problem solved by troubleshooting:
      → No return needed!
      
   B) Customer damaged during installation:
      → Offer replacement at discount (goodwill)
      
   C) Part is actually defective:
      → Warranty replacement (free)
```

## 🔧 Warranty Claim Examples

### Example 1: Cracked Fitting

**Customer Report**: *"AN-6 fitting cracked while tightening. It wasn't even tight yet."*

**Assessment**:
```
Questions:
• "Can you send a photo of the crack?"
• "Were you tightening by hand or with wrench?"
• "Did it take a lot of force?"

[Customer sends photo showing crack in body, not at threads]

Analysis: Material defect (shouldn't crack during normal tightening)
Decision: WARRANTY REPLACEMENT
```

**Your Response**:
```
"That's definitely a manufacturing defect. AN fittings should never
crack during normal installation!

I'm shipping a replacement right away (free, overnight if you need it).

Please keep the broken fitting and return it when you get the replacement
(I'll include a prepaid label).

We'll inspect it to prevent this from happening to other customers.

Sorry for the inconvenience!"
```

---

### Example 2: Threads Stripped

**Customer Report**: *"The threads stripped when I was threading it on by hand."*

**Assessment**:
```
Questions:
• "Were you threading it onto another AN fitting or an adapter?"
• "Did it thread on smoothly at first, or was it hard from the start?"
• "Can you send photos of both pieces?"

[Customer sends photos showing stripped threads]

Analysis:
• If threads stripped with light hand-pressure: DEFECT
• If customer forced it and cross-threaded: DAMAGE

Photos show:
• Threads look machined incorrectly (defect)
Decision: WARRANTY REPLACEMENT
```

**Your Response**:
```
"Those threads definitely don't look right. Quality issue on our end!

I'm sending replacements today (free). You should be able to thread
these on easily by hand before even using a wrench.

Return the defective ones (prepaid label included) so we can inspect.

Thanks for letting us know—this helps us catch quality issues!"
```

---

### Example 3: Leaking After Installation

**Customer Report**: *"I installed these a week ago and they leak. I want a warranty replacement."*

**Assessment**: Could be defect OR installation issue

**Your Response**:
```
"Let's diagnose the leak first. A few possibilities:

1. Damaged flare (defect) → Warranty replacement
2. Wrong fitting type (AN vs NPT vs ORB) → Need adapter
3. Installation issue (tightening, debris) → Troubleshoot fix

Can you tell me:
• Where exactly is it leaking?
• How tight did you make it?
• What are you connecting to?

[Based on answers, diagnose]

If defect: Warranty replacement
If installation: Help fix it
If wrong part: Send correct adapter"
```

---

## 💡 Solutions Before Returns

### Try These First (Often Avoids Return)

**1. Send Missing Pieces**
```
Customer: "Kit is missing an adapter"

Instead of return:
"Let me send the missing adapter right away (free, overnight).
You can continue your build without waiting for a return!"
```

**2. Send Correct Size (Keep Wrong Size)**
```
Customer: "Ordered wrong size, need return"

Instead of return (if low-value):
"I'll send the correct size today. Keep the wrong size as backup
or for another project. No return needed!"

[For <$50 value, saves shipping cost + goodwill]
[Requires manager approval for >$50]
```

**3. Provide Installation Help**
```
Customer: "Can't get this to work, want to return"

Instead of return:
"Let me help you install it! [Walk through installation]
[Customer succeeds]
"Great! Glad we got it working!"

Result: No return, customer has working system
```
