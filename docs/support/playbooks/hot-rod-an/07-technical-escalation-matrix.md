# Technical Escalation Matrix

**Customer**: Hot Rod AN  
**Purpose**: Define clear escalation criteria for AN sizing and fuel system technical questions  
**Target Audience**: Customer Support Operators (All Levels)  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  

---

## üéØ Purpose & Scope

This escalation matrix defines:
- ‚úÖ **When** to escalate technical questions beyond your certification level
- ‚úÖ **Who** to escalate to (Technical Support, Manager, Engineer)
- ‚úÖ **How** to document and hand off escalations
- ‚úÖ **Expected response times** for each escalation type

**Key Principle**: *Escalate early on safety issues, escalate appropriately on technical complexity.*

---

## üìä Escalation Decision Framework

### The 4-Question Escalation Test

Before escalating, ask yourself:

1. **Is this a safety issue?** (fuel fire, brake failure, injury risk)
   - **YES** ‚Üí Escalate immediately to Technical Support (P0)
   - **NO** ‚Üí Continue to Question 2

2. **Is this covered in our playbooks?** (check FAQ, troubleshooting guides)
   - **YES** ‚Üí Use playbook guidance, no escalation needed
   - **NO** ‚Üí Continue to Question 3

3. **Is this within my certification level?**
   - **NO** ‚Üí Escalate to higher-level operator or Technical Support
   - **YES** ‚Üí Continue to Question 4

4. **Have I tried all troubleshooting steps?**
   - **NO** ‚Üí Complete troubleshooting, then reassess
   - **YES** ‚Üí Escalate to Technical Support with documentation

## üéì Escalation Training Scenarios

### Practice Scenario 1: Safety Issue

**Customer Says**: *"I installed AN fittings on my fuel line and now I smell fuel really strong in the garage. The fitting near my exhaust header looks wet."*

**Your Action**:
1. ‚úÖ **Immediately advise**: "Please don't start the vehicle. Safety is our top priority."
2. ‚úÖ **Escalate**: P0 - Critical to technical@hotrodan.com
3. ‚úÖ **Document**: Fuel leak near heat source, immediate fire risk
4. ‚úÖ **Customer notification**: "I'm getting our technical team on this right away. Expect a call within 30 minutes. In the meantime, keep the vehicle off and ensure good ventilation."

**Why P0**: Fuel leak near ignition source = fire risk = immediate escalation

---

### Practice Scenario 2: Complex Sizing Question

**Customer Says**: *"I'm building a twin-turbo LQ9 with a ProCharger P-1X. Targeting 950 HP on pump gas with E85 option. What size AN fuel lines do I need?"*

**Your Action**:
1. ‚úÖ **Acknowledge complexity**: "That's an impressive build! This requires expert fuel system design."
2. ‚úÖ **Escalate**: P1 - Urgent to technical@hotrodan.com with tag `[SIZING - ADVANCED]`
3. ‚úÖ **Document**: High-HP forced induction, dual fuel compatibility (pump gas + E85)
4. ‚úÖ **Customer notification**: "Our technical team specializes in forced induction fuel systems. You'll hear back within 2 hours with a complete fuel system recommendation including line sizes, pump specs, and regulator setup."

**Why P1**: Exceeds playbook HP guidelines (>800 HP), forced induction, dual fuel setup

---

### Practice Scenario 3: Frustration Escalation

**Customer Says**: *"This is the third fitting I've ordered and they all leak! You guys sold me the wrong stuff and now I've wasted $200 and a weekend. I want a refund!"*

**Your Action**:
1. ‚úÖ **De-escalate first**: "I'm really sorry you've had this experience. Let's figure out what's going on so we can get this solved today."
2. ‚úÖ **Troubleshoot**: Walk through leak diagnosis (likely installation issue or wrong fitting type)
3. ‚úÖ **If customer remains hostile**: Escalate to manager@hotrodan.com with tag `[CUSTOMER SERVICE]`
4. ‚úÖ **Document**: Customer purchase history, troubleshooting attempts, customer skill level assessment

**When to Escalate**: After de-escalation attempts, if customer demands manager or refund beyond policy
