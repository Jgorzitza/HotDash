## What are AN Fittings?

### Overview
**AN** stands for "Army-Navy" - a standardized fitting system developed for military aircraft that became the industry standard for high-performance automotive fuel systems.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Precision Threading**: 37° flare angle for leak-free connections
- **High Performance**: Handles high pressure, vibration, and temperature extremes
- **Reusable**: Can be assembled and disassembled multiple times
- **Standardized**: Consistent sizing across all manufacturers

### Why Hot Rod Builders Use AN Fittings

**Primary Benefits:**
1. **Leak Prevention**: Superior sealing under high-pressure conditions
2. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, polished look for show cars
3. **Reliability**: Proven in racing and performance applications
4. **Versatility**: Wide range of sizes and configurations
5. **Safety**: Secure connections for flammable fuel systems

**Common Applications:**
- Fuel lines (carburetor to fuel pump)
- Oil cooler lines
- Transmission cooler lines
- Brake lines (DOT-approved fittings)
- Power steering lines
- Nitrous oxide systems

## AN Fitting Size Guide

### Understanding AN Sizes

**AN Size = OD in 1/16" increments**

| AN Size | Inside Diameter | Outside Diameter | Common Use |
|---------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| AN-3    | 3/16" (0.1875") | 3/16" (dash size/16) | Small vacuum lines, oil pressure |
| AN-4    | 1/4" (0.25")    | 1/4" | Fuel return lines, oil drain |
| AN-6    | 3/8" (0.375")   | 3/8" | **MOST COMMON** - Fuel feed lines |
| AN-8    | 1/2" (0.50")    | 1/2" | High-volume fuel systems, oil coolers |
| AN-10   | 5/8" (0.625")   | 5/8" | Large fuel systems, transmission coolers |
| AN-12   | 3/4" (0.75")    | 3/4" | Supercharger/turbo oil lines |
| AN-16   | 1" (1.0")       | 1" | Professional racing fuel systems |

**Memory Aid for Operators:**
- "AN-6 is 6/16 of an inch = 3/8" - this is the most commonly ordered size"
- "Divide the dash number by 16 to get the size in inches"
- "Fuel feed = AN-6, Fuel return = AN-4"

### Critical Operator Note
⚠️ **Customers often confuse thread size with hose size!**
- **AN-6 fitting** ≠ 6mm or 6 inches
- **AN-6 = 3/8" inside diameter**
- Always confirm: "What's your current fuel line diameter?" not "What size fitting do you need?"

## Common AN Fitting Configurations

### Fuel System Basics

**Typical Hot Rod Fuel System Components:**
```
Fuel Tank → Fuel Line (AN-6) → Fuel Pump → Fuel Filter → 
Fuel Pressure Regulator → Carburetor (AN-6) → Fuel Return (AN-4) → Tank
```

**Standard Kit Configuration:**
- 2x AN-6 straight fittings (carburetor inlet/outlet)
- 2x AN-6 to -6 hose ends (fuel pump connections)
- 1x AN-6 to AN-4 reducer (return line)
- 1x AN-6 fuel filter adapter
- 1x AN-6 bulkhead fitting (firewall pass-through)

### Adapters & Reducers

**Common Adapter Scenarios:**

1. **NPT to AN Adapter**
   - Connects threaded NPT fuel pump to AN hose
   - Example: 1/2" NPT to AN-6
   - "Customer has a Holley fuel pump with NPT threads"

2. **AN Size Reducer**
   - Connects different AN sizes
   - Example: AN-6 to AN-4 (fuel feed to return)
   - "Reduce from feed line to return line size"

3. **Inverted Flare Adapter**
   - Converts AN to inverted flare (brake lines)
   - Example: AN-3 to 3/16" inverted flare
   - "Customer wants to connect to stock brake fittings"

4. **Carburetor Adapter**
   - Connects AN fitting to carburetor inlet
   - Example: AN-6 to 5/8"-18 thread (Holley carb)
   - Specific to carburetor brand (Holley, Edelbrock, Demon)

## Common Customer Questions & Gold Replies

### Q: "What size AN fitting do I need for my carburetor?"

**Gold Reply Template:**
```
Hi {{customerName}},

Great question! The most common fuel inlet size for hot rod carburetors is AN-6 (3/8" diameter). However, this varies by carburetor brand:

• Holley Carburetors: AN-6 or 5/8"-18 thread (requires adapter)
• Edelbrock Carburetors: 7/8"-20 thread (requires AN-6 to 7/8"-20 adapter)
• Demon Carburetors: AN-6 or 5/8"-18 thread

Could you share your carburetor brand and model number? I'll confirm the exact adapter you need and make sure you get the right fitting the first time.

Best,

### Q: "Will AN-6 fittings work with my 3/8" fuel line?"

**Gold Reply Template:**
```
Hi {{customerName}},

Yes! AN-6 fittings are designed for 3/8" inside diameter fuel line, so you're on the right track.

However, there are two connection methods to consider:

1. **Braided Stainless Hose**: Uses reusable AN-6 hose ends (screw onto the hose)
2. **Push-Lock Hose**: Uses AN-6 barbed fittings (push on, no clamps needed)

Which type of hose are you planning to use? I can recommend the exact fittings and hose ends you'll need to complete your system.

Let me know!

### Q: "Do I need thread sealant with AN fittings?"

**Gold Reply Template:**
```
Hi {{customerName}},

Great question! **No thread sealant needed** for proper AN fittings. Here's why:

AN fittings use a **37° flare seal**, which creates a metal-to-metal seal between the flare and the fitting seat. The threads themselves don't seal—they just hold the flare in place.

**Exception**: If you're using NPT adapters (tapered pipe threads), those DO require sealant or Teflon tape.

**Installation Tips:**
• Tighten until snug, then 1/8 to 1/4 turn more
• Don't over-tighten (can damage the flare)
• If it leaks, check for debris or damage, don't just tighten more

Need any specific fittings or adapters? I'm here to help!

### Q: "Can I reuse AN fittings if I take apart my fuel system?"

**Gold Reply Template:**
```
Hi {{customerName}},

Yes! One of the best features of AN fittings is that they're **fully reusable**. You can assemble and disassemble them multiple times without losing the seal.

**Best Practices for Reuse:**
• Inspect the 37° flare for damage or scratches
• Check threads for cross-threading or debris
• Clean fittings with brake cleaner before reinstalling
• Replace if you see visible damage to the sealing surface

**When to Replace:**
• Deep scratches on the flare cone
• Damaged or crossed threads
• Corrosion that affects the sealing surface
• After 3-5 disassembly cycles (preventive replacement)

Want me to check if we have replacements in stock just in case?
