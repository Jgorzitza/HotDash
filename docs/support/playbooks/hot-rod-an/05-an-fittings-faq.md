## General AN Fitting Questions

### Q: What does "AN" stand for?

**A**: **AN** stands for **Army-Navy**, referring to the military specification developed for aircraft fuel systems. The standard was created during WWII for military aircraft and became the industry standard for high-performance automotive applications.

**Why it matters**: AN fittings are battle-tested, reliable, and consistent across all manufacturers. If you buy an AN-6 fitting from any brand, it will fit any AN-6 hose or port.

**Operator Note**: This is a great conversation starter about quality and reliability!

---

### Q: How do I convert AN size to inches?

**A**: **Divide the AN dash number by 16**

**Formula**: AN Size ÷ 16 = Size in inches

**Examples**:
- AN-4 = 4/16 = 1/4 inch
- AN-6 = 6/16 = 3/8 inch (most common)
- AN-8 = 8/16 = 1/2 inch
- AN-10 = 10/16 = 5/8 inch
- AN-12 = 12/16 = 3/4 inch

**Memory Aid**: "The dash number is sixteenths of an inch"

**Operator Note**: Customers often confuse this with metric sizes. AN-6 is NOT 6mm!

---

### Q: What size AN fitting do I need for my hot rod fuel system?

**A**: **AN-6 (3/8") for most street hot rods**

**Sizing by Horsepower**:
- **Up to 150 HP**: AN-4 (minimum, not recommended for feed line)
- **150-400 HP**: AN-6 (standard for most hot rods)
- **400-700 HP**: AN-8 (big blocks, high-performance)
- **700+ HP**: AN-10 or AN-12 (racing, forced induction)

**Typical Hot Rod Setup**:
- Fuel feed line: AN-6
- Fuel return line: AN-4
- Oil cooler lines: AN-8 to AN-10

**Rule of Thumb**: When in doubt, go one size larger. Bigger = better flow, no downside except cost.

---

### Q: Can I reuse AN fittings?

**A**: **Yes! AN fittings are designed to be reusable.**

**Reusability Details**:
- Properly installed AN fittings can be taken apart and reassembled multiple times
- Metal-to-metal seal reforms each time (37° flare design)
- Recommended lifespan: 3-5 assembly cycles before replacement

**Best Practices for Reuse**:
1. Inspect flare for scratches or damage before reusing
2. Clean thoroughly with brake cleaner
3. Check threads for cross-threading or debris
4. Replace if any visible damage to sealing surfaces

**When to Replace**:
- Deep scratches on 37° flare cone
- Cross-threaded or damaged threads
- Corrosion affecting sealing surfaces
- After 5+ disassembly cycles (preventive replacement)

---

### Q: Do I need thread sealant or Teflon tape on AN fittings?

**A**: **NO! AN fittings do NOT need thread sealant.**

**Why No Sealant**:
- AN fittings use a **37° flare seal** (metal-to-metal)
- The seal happens at the flare cone, NOT at the threads
- Threads only hold the fitting in place, they don't seal
- Sealant can actually prevent proper sealing

**EXCEPTION - NPT Adapters**:
If you're using NPT (National Pipe Thread) adapters, those DO require sealant:
- NPT threads are tapered and seal via the threads
- Use Teflon tape (2-3 wraps) or liquid thread sealant
- Apply sealant to NPT threads only, never to AN flare surfaces

**Visual Guide**:
```
AN Fitting: NO SEALANT ✅
   Flare Cone (seals here) ← Metal-to-metal seal
   Threads (hold it tight) ← Don't seal, just hold

NPT Adapter: SEALANT REQUIRED ✅
   Tapered threads ← Seal via thread compression
   Teflon tape or liquid sealant needed
```

---

### Q: How tight should I tighten AN fittings?

**A**: **Hand tight + 1/8 to 1/4 turn with a wrench**

**Proper Tightening Process**:
1. Thread on by hand until snug (can't turn easily by hand)
2. Use two wrenches (one on each side)
3. Tighten 1/8 to 1/4 turn past snug
4. STOP - that's it!

**Common Mistakes**:
- **Over-tightening**: Damages the flare, causes leaks
- **Under-tightening**: Doesn't compress flare enough, causes leaks

**How to Know if You're Over-Tightening**:
- Requires excessive force
- Fitting won't turn further
- Aluminum shows cracks or deformation
- You're using all your strength (you're doing it wrong!)

**Operator Gold Reply**:
"Think of it like this: Once it's snug, give it just 1/8 of a full turn more. That's about 45 degrees—like moving a clock hand from 12 to 1:30. That's it!"

## Sizing & Compatibility Questions

### Q: Will AN-6 fittings fit my 3/8" fuel line?

**A**: **Yes, but it depends on the hose type.**

**Three Options**:

**1. Braided Stainless Hose**:
- Use reusable AN-6 hose ends (screw-on type)
- Socket and nipple assembly
- Professional appearance

**2. Push-Lock Hose**:
- Use AN-6 barbed fittings
- Push hose onto barbs (no clamps needed)
- Budget-friendly

**3. Standard Rubber Hose**:
- Use AN-6 hose ends designed for rubber hose
- May require hose clamps
- Least durable option

**Operator Note**: Ask "What type of hose are you planning to use?" to recommend correct fittings.

---

### Q: What's the difference between AN and NPT fittings?

**A**: **AN and NPT are completely different thread types—not interchangeable!**

**AN (Army-Navy)**:
- **Straight threads** with 37° flare
- Seal at the flare (metal-to-metal)
- No sealant needed
- Reusable
- Used for: Fuel lines, oil lines, brake lines

**NPT (National Pipe Thread)**:
- **Tapered threads**
- Seal via thread compression
- Requires Teflon tape or thread sealant
- Less reusable (threads deform slightly each use)
- Used for: Pressure gauges, fuel pumps, some adapters

**How to Tell Them Apart**:
- AN threads: Straight, same diameter from end to end
- NPT threads: Tapered, gets smaller toward the end

**Common Scenario**:
"I have a fuel pump with 1/2" NPT ports. What AN fitting do I need?"
→ **Answer**: You need a 1/2" NPT to AN-6 (or AN-8) adapter. NPT side screws into pump (with sealant), AN side connects to your hose.

---

### Q: What's the difference between ORB and AN fittings?

**A**: **ORB uses straight threads with an O-ring seal. AN uses a 37° flare.**

**ORB (O-Ring Boss)**:
- Straight threads with O-ring groove
- Seal via O-ring compression
- Common on modern fuel pumps, regulators
- No sealant needed (O-ring does the sealing)

**AN (Flare)**:
- 37° cone seals metal-to-metal
- No O-ring
- Traditional high-performance standard

**How to Identify ORB Ports**:
- Look for O-ring groove on male fitting
- Flat sealing surface on female port
- Common on Aeromotive, Holley, Edelbrock fuel components

**Common Scenario**:
"My fuel pressure regulator has ORB ports. What do I need?"
→ **Answer**: You need AN-to-ORB adapters. The ORB side includes an O-ring and threads into your regulator. The AN side connects to your fuel line.

---

### Q: Can I mix aluminum and stainless steel AN fittings?

**A**: **Yes, but be careful about galvanic corrosion.**

**Best Practices**:
- **Dry environments**: Mixing is fine
- **Coastal/humid areas**: Use all stainless or all aluminum
- **Anti-seize on threads**: Helps prevent corrosion (threads only, NOT flare!)

**Galvanic Corrosion Explained**:
When dissimilar metals (aluminum + stainless) touch in the presence of moisture, one corrodes faster. In this case, aluminum corrodes.

**Recommendation**:
- **Street cars, dry climate**: Mix freely
- **Show cars**: Match metals for appearance
- **Coastal areas**: All stainless steel
- **Budget builds**: All aluminum (easiest and cheapest)

## Hose & Material Questions

### Q: What's the difference between braided stainless and rubber hose?

**A**: **Performance, appearance, and durability**

**Braided Stainless Steel Hose**:
- **Pros**: Professional look, durable, abrasion-resistant, impermeable to fuel
- **Cons**: More expensive, stiffer, requires special assembly
- **Best For**: Show cars, visible installations, long-term durability
- **Price**: $$-$$$

**Rubber Hose with AN Ends**:
- **Pros**: Flexible, easy to route, budget-friendly
- **Cons**: Degrades over time (5-7 years), permeates fuel vapor
- **Best For**: Budget builds, temporary installations
- **Price**: $

**Push-Lock Hose**:
- **Pros**: Easy installation, no special tools, good flexibility
- **Cons**: Less professional look than braided
- **Best For**: DIY builds, return lines, under-car routing
- **Price**: $$

**PTFE (Teflon) Lined Hose**:
- **Pros**: Handles any fluid (gas, alcohol, nitrous), high temperature
- **Cons**: Most expensive, requires special assembly tools
- **Best For**: Racing, alcohol fuel, extreme applications
- **Price**: $$$$

**Operator Recommendation**:
- **Show car/engine bay**: Braided stainless
- **Budget build**: Push-lock or rubber
- **Racing**: PTFE lined
- **Daily driver**: Braided stainless or push-lock

---

### Q: Do I need to replace my rubber fuel lines?

**A**: **Yes, every 5-7 years, or sooner if you have ethanol fuel.**

**Why Rubber Degrades**:
- Modern ethanol fuel (E10/E15) attacks standard rubber
- UV exposure breaks down rubber compounds
- Heat cycling causes cracks and brittleness
- Fuel permeates through walls (causes fuel smell)

**Signs Your Hose Needs Replacement**:
- Fuel smell with no visible leaks
- Hose is 5+ years old
- Visible cracks or dry-rot
- Hose feels stiff or brittle
- Fuel stains on outside of hose

**Replacement Options**:
1. **Ethanol-compatible rubber** (good for 5-7 years)
2. **Braided stainless** (lifetime durability)
3. **Push-lock** (middle ground, 7-10 years)

**Safety Warning**: Don't wait for visible leaks! Replace on schedule as preventive maintenance.

---

### Q: What's the difference between aluminum and anodized aluminum fittings?

**A**: **Anodizing adds a protective coating and color options.**

**Raw Aluminum**:
- Natural silver/gray finish
- Can oxidize (white powder on surface)
- Most affordable
- Fine for most applications

**Anodized Aluminum**:
- Hard oxide coating applied
- Corrosion-resistant
- Color options (black, red, blue, gold)
- More expensive than raw aluminum
- Better for show cars

**Black Anodized (Popular Choice)**:
- "Stealth" or "murdered out" look
- Hides oil stains better
- Modern aesthetic

**Operator Recommendation**:
- **Budget builds**: Raw aluminum (works great, just not as pretty long-term)
- **Show cars**: Anodized (color-matched to engine bay)
- **Coastal/humid**: Anodized or stainless steel
- **Stealth look**: Black anodized

**Performance Difference**: None. It's purely aesthetic and corrosion protection.

## Carburetor & Fuel Pump Questions

### Q: What size AN fitting do I need for my Holley carburetor?

**A**: **Most Holley carburetors use 5/8"-18 thread, which requires an adapter for AN fittings.**

**Holley Carburetor Inlet Sizes**:
- **Small Holley (4150/4160)**: 5/8"-18 thread
- **Large Holley (4500 Dominator)**: 3/4"-16 thread
- **Some Performance Models**: Direct AN-6 or AN-8 ports

**Adapters You Need**:
- AN-6 to 5/8"-18 adapter (most common)
- AN-8 to 5/8"-18 adapter (high-performance)

**Typical Setup**:
```
Fuel Line (AN-6) → AN-6 Male Fitting → Adapter (5/8"-18 to AN-6) → Carburetor Inlet
```

**Operator Note**: Always ask "What's your carburetor brand and model?" before recommending adapters.

---

### Q: What fuel pressure should I run with my carburetor?

**A**: **5-7 PSI for most carburetors**

**Fuel Pressure by Carburetor Type**:
| Carburetor | Ideal Pressure |
|------------|----------------|
| Holley (standard) | 5-7 PSI |
| Edelbrock | 4-6 PSI |
| Demon / Quick Fuel | 6-8 PSI |
| Rochester / Quadrajet | 5-6 PSI |
| Weber / Dellorto | 2.5-4 PSI |

**Why Pressure Matters**:
- **Too high** = Carburetor floods (fuel drips from vents)
- **Too low** = Fuel starvation (engine hesitates or dies)

**How to Set Pressure**:
1. Install adjustable fuel pressure regulator
2. Connect fuel pressure gauge
3. Start engine and let idle
4. Adjust regulator to carburetor manufacturer spec
5. Test drive and verify no flooding

**If You Don't Have a Regulator**:
Most electric fuel pumps run 10-15 PSI (too high for carburetors!). You NEED a regulator if using an electric pump.

---

### Q: My carburetor is flooding. What do I check?

**A**: **Two main causes: Fuel pressure too high OR bad needle and seat**

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

**1. Check Fuel Pressure**:
```
• Install fuel pressure gauge
• Should be 5-7 PSI for Holley
• If above 7 PSI → Install or adjust fuel pressure regulator
```

**2. Check Needle and Seat**:
```
• Remove carburetor top (air horn)
• Inspect needle for wear or debris
• Check float for damage (fuel inside = bad)
• Replace needle and seat kit (cheap, easy fix)
```

**3. Check Float Level**:
```
• Set float level per carburetor specs
• Typical Holley: 7/16" from gasket surface
• Too high = flooding
```

**Quick Test**:
Turn off fuel pump. If flooding stops, the problem is pressure or needle/seat (not carburetor design).

## Installation & Troubleshooting Questions

### Q: Why is my AN fitting leaking?

**A**: **Five common causes (check in this order):**

**1. Under-Tightened** (most common)
- Solution: Tighten 1/8-1/4 turn more
- Test again after tightening

**2. Damaged Flare**
- Inspect 37° cone for scratches/dents
- Solution: Replace fitting if damaged

**3. Debris on Sealing Surface**
- Clean with brake cleaner
- Blow out with compressed air
- Reassemble dry (no sealant)

**4. Over-Tightened** (crushed flare)
- Look for deformed or flattened flare
- Solution: Replace fitting

**5. Wrong Fitting Type**
- AN flare fitting in ORB or NPT port won't seal
- Solution: Use correct adapter

**Operator Troubleshooting Script**:
```
1. "Have you tried tightening it 1/8 turn more?"
2. "If still leaking, let's inspect the flare for damage"
3. "Can you send a photo of the fitting?"
4. "What are you connecting to? (carburetor, fuel pump, etc.)"
```

---

### Q: My fitting won't thread on. What do I do?

**A**: **STOP! Don't force it. Here's the fix:**

**Recovery Steps**:
```
1. STOP turning immediately (don't force!)
2. Back out by turning counter-clockwise
3. Inspect threads for damage or debris
4. Clean threads with brake cleaner
5. Try again the RIGHT way:
   • Turn counter-clockwise until you feel a "click"
   • NOW turn clockwise—should thread smoothly
   • Start by hand (no wrench!) for first 3-4 turns
```

**If Threads Are Damaged**:
- Fitting needs to be replaced
- Cross-threaded fittings can't be repaired
- We can send replacement quickly

**Prevention**:
Always start AN fittings by hand! Never use a wrench until the fitting is hand-tight.

---

### Q: Can I use anti-seize on AN fittings?

**A**: **Yes, on threads ONLY—never on the flare sealing surface!**

**Proper Use**:
- Apply small amount to threads
- Helps prevent galling (thread damage)
- Makes disassembly easier
- Good for stainless steel fittings

**CRITICAL**:
- **DO** apply to threads (NOT sealing surface!)
- **DON'T** apply to 37° flare cone
- **DON'T** use as a substitute for proper torque

**When to Use Anti-Seize**:
- Stainless steel to stainless steel (prevents galling)
- Aluminum in corrosive environments
- Fittings you'll disassemble frequently

**When NOT Needed**:
- Aluminum to aluminum (soft threads, less likely to gall)
- One-time installation
- When using brand new fittings

---

### Q: Why does my fitting keep coming loose?

**A**: **Vibration is loosening it. Here are solutions:**

**Temporary Fix**:
Re-tighten to proper torque

**Permanent Solutions**:

**1. Swivel Fittings**
- Replace with swivel/rotating fittings
- Absorbs vibration
- Stays tight longer

**2. Thread Locker**
- Apply blue Loctite 242 to threads (NOT flare!)
- Allows disassembly if needed
- Prevents loosening from vibration

**3. Rubber Isolation**
- Mount vibrating components on rubber mounts
- Reduces vibration transfer to fittings

**4. Safety Wire** (racing applications)
- Wire fittings together
- Prevents loosening
- Required in racing

**Best Solution for Hot Rods**:
Swivel fittings—most effective and easiest to install.

- Swivel fittings (if tight clearances)

**Operator Note**: Offer to create a custom parts list based on their specific vehicle and setup.

---

### Q: What's better—straight, 45°, or 90° fittings?

**A**: **Depends on clearance and routing needs**

**Straight Fittings**:
- **Use When**: Plenty of clearance, straight line routing
- **Pros**: Simplest, cheapest, least flow restriction
- **Cons**: Requires bending hose if not straight shot

**45° Fittings**:
- **Use When**: Moderate clearance issues, gentle bends
- **Pros**: Good compromise, versatile
- **Cons**: Mid-price

**90° Fittings**:
- **Use When**: Very tight spaces, sharp turns
- **Pros**: Routes around tight obstacles
- **Cons**: Most expensive, slight flow restriction

**Common Combinations**:
- Carburetor inlet: 45° or 90° (clears distributor)
- Fuel pump outlet: Straight or 45°
- Firewall pass-through: Straight (with bulkhead fitting)
- Fuel rail connections: 90° (tight engine bay)

**Pro Tip**: Order a mix of angles. You can always return unused fittings, but waiting for the right angle delays your build!

---

### Q: Should I buy aluminum or stainless steel fittings?

**A**: **Aluminum for most hot rods. Stainless for specific situations.**

**Aluminum Fittings**:
- **Best For**: 90% of hot rod applications
- **Pros**: Lightweight, affordable, easy to work with
- **Cons**: Can corrode in harsh environments
- **Price**: $ (most budget-friendly)

**Stainless Steel Fittings**:
- **Best For**: Coastal areas, brake lines, long-term durability
- **Pros**: Corrosion-resistant, strong, long-lasting
- **Cons**: Heavier, more expensive, can gall (thread damage)
- **Price**: $$ (mid-range)

**When to Choose Stainless**:
- You live near ocean or in humid climate
- Brake lines (safety-critical)
- Want lifetime durability
- Budget allows

**When Aluminum is Fine**:
- Dry inland climate
- Budget build
- Fuel lines (non-safety-critical)
- Most street hot rods

**Operator Recommendation**:
"For most hot rods, aluminum is perfect and saves money. If you're near the coast or want extra durability, go stainless."

## Safety Questions

### Q: Are AN fittings safe for fuel systems?

**A**: **Yes! AN fittings are EXTREMELY safe when installed correctly.**

**Safety Features**:
- Military-spec design (tested in aircraft)
- Metal-to-metal seal (no degrading rubber gaskets)
- Vibration-resistant
- Reusable and inspectable
- Consistent manufacturing standards

**Installation Safety**:
- Follow proper torque specs (snug + 1/8-1/4 turn)
- Inspect regularly for leaks
- Replace if damaged
- Use proper hose (ethanol-compatible)

**Compared to Alternatives**:
- **Safer than**: Rubber hose with clamps (clamps loosen, hose degrades)
- **Equal to**: Hard lines (but easier to install)
- **Industry standard**: Used in NASCAR, drag racing, aircraft

**Bottom Line**: AN fittings are the gold standard for performance fuel systems. When installed correctly, they're safer than stock rubber hose systems.

---

### Q: Can I use AN fittings for brake lines?

**A**: **Yes, but use DOT-approved stainless steel fittings and proper brake-rated hose.**

**Requirements**:
- **Fittings**: Stainless steel AN-3 fittings (3/16" ID)
- **Hose**: DOT-approved braided brake line
- **Installation**: Follow all DOT brake line standards

**DOT Approval Needed**:
Standard AN fittings and hose are NOT DOT-approved for brakes. You need brake-specific:
- DOT FMVSS 106 approved brake hose
- Proper crimped or assembled hose ends
- Correct fitting sizes for brake calipers/master cylinder

**Warning**:
Brakes are safety-critical! If you're not 100% confident, have a professional install brake lines.

**Operator Note**: For brake line questions, recommend DOT-approved brake-specific AN kits and suggest professional installation if customer seems uncertain.
