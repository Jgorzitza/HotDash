## 🎪 On-Site Support Procedures

### If Hot Rod AN Staffs an Event Booth

**Booth Setup**:
- Product display (top sellers)
- Sizing chart (printed, laminated)
- Installation samples (show how fittings work)
- Business cards
- Order forms or tablet (process orders on-site)

**Staff Training**:
- Product knowledge (know top 10 products cold)
- Sizing assistance (help customers size their builds)
- Troubleshooting (answer technical questions)
- Order processing (take orders, arrange shipping)

**Engagement Tactics**:
```
Don't: Sit and wait for customers
Do: Engage proactively

"Hey! Nice [car model]! What engine are you running?
[Customer answers]
Cool! Have you upgraded to AN fittings yet? We can help
you size them for your build."

[Customer shows interest]

"Let me show you... [demonstrate product]"
```

---

### Remote Event Support (Not On-Site)

**Customer at Event, We're Not**:

```
Customer: "I'm at [Drag Strip] and my fuel fitting just broke.
Can you overnight a replacement?"

✅ Your Response:
"Oh no! Let's get you a replacement ASAP.

Unfortunately, overnight won't arrive until Monday (events are
usually Saturday/Sunday).

Here are your options:

Option 1: Local Auto Parts Store
• [Store Name] at [Address] (15 min from track) might carry AN fittings
• Call ahead: [Phone]
• Ask for AN-6 straight fitting

Option 2: Temporary Fix (If safe)
• [Only if appropriate - reference troubleshooting playbook]
• Get you through today's runs
• Replace properly for next event

Option 3: Ship for Next Weekend
• I'll overnight parts Monday for Friday delivery
• You'll have them for next race

What works best for your situation?"
```

**Why This Approach**:
- Acknowledge urgency
- Provide realistic options (don't promise impossible)
- Help solve problem (even if we can't ship in time)
- Maintain relationship (plan for next race)
