# Quality Issue Handling Workflow

**Customer**: Hot Rod AN  
**Purpose**: Handle defective parts, quality claims, and supplier coordination  
**Target Audience**: Support operators, quality team  
**Created**: October 12, 2025

## üéØ Quality Issue Framework

### Types of Quality Issues

**Manufacturing Defects** (Supplier's fault):
- Cracks in fitting body
- Improperly machined threads
- Flare surface defects
- Material flaws

**Shipping Damage** (Carrier's fault):
- Bent fittings
- Scratched finish
- Crushed packaging
- Missing pieces

**Installation Damage** (Customer's fault):
- Cross-threaded
- Over-tightened
- Dropped/impacted
- Modified/altered

**Goal**: Identify root cause, make it right for customer, coordinate with supplier if needed.

## üîç Quality Issue Investigation

### Step 1: Gather Evidence

**Request from Customer**:
```
"I'd like to help resolve this. Can you send me:
1. Photos of the defect (close-up and full view)
2. Part number from packaging
3. Order number
4. Description of what happened

This helps me determine if it's a defect or installation issue,
and gets you a resolution faster!"
```

**What to Look For in Photos**:
- Crack location (body, threads, flare?)
- Thread condition (clean machining or rough?)
- Flare surface (smooth or damaged?)
- Overall condition (new/clean or used/dirty?)

---

### Step 2: Assess Root Cause

**Manufacturing Defect Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Crack in fitting body (material failure)
- ‚úÖ Rough/incomplete threads (machining error)
- ‚úÖ Flare not properly formed (manufacturing)
- ‚úÖ Wrong size stamped on fitting (quality control error)
- ‚úÖ Anodizing defects (bubbles, peeling)

**Installation Damage Indicators**:
- ‚ùå Cross-threaded (bent threads in one direction)
- ‚ùå Crushed flare (over-tightening marks visible)
- ‚ùå Tool marks (scratches, gouges from wrench)
- ‚ùå Dirty/used appearance (fuel residue, grime)

**Shipping Damage Indicators**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bent fitting (impact damage)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Packaging crushed or damaged
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple parts damaged in same order
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Customer reports damage upon opening

---

### Step 3: Make Decision

**If Manufacturing Defect**:
```
‚Üí Immediate warranty replacement (free, our fault)
‚Üí Return defective part for inspection
‚Üí Document for supplier quality claim
```

**If Installation Damage**:
```
‚Üí Offer replacement at discount (goodwill, educate customer)
‚Üí Provide installation guide (prevent repeat)
‚Üí No supplier claim
```

**If Shipping Damage**:
```
‚Üí File claim with carrier (our responsibility)
‚Üí Immediate replacement (free, not customer's fault)
‚Üí Customer keeps or disposes damaged part
```

**If Uncertain**:
```
‚Üí Escalate to manager with photos
‚Üí Err on side of customer (benefit of doubt)
‚Üí Better to replace than argue
```

## üîÑ Warranty Replacement Process

### Fast-Track Process (Manufacturing Defects)

**Step 1: Acknowledge & Apologize**
```
"I'm really sorry you received a defective part. That's not typical
of our quality, and we'll make it right immediately."
```

**Step 2: Ship Replacement First**
```
"I'm shipping a replacement today. Would you like:
‚Ä¢ Standard shipping (3-5 days, free)
‚Ä¢ Overnight (next day, free if you need it urgently)

Since this is our quality issue, shipping is on us either way!"
```

**Step 3: Return Defective Part**
```
"I'll include a prepaid return label with your replacement.

Please return the defective fitting when you get the replacement‚Äîwe
inspect returns to prevent this from happening to other customers.

You don't need to return it before getting the replacement. Get your
project done first!"
```

**Timeline**:
- Replacement ships: Same day (if order by 3pm)
- Customer receives: 1-3 days
- Defective part returned: At customer's convenience
- Refund (if paid): Immediate (don't wait for return)

---

## üìä Quality Issue Tracking

### Document Every Quality Issue

**Quality Issue Report** (Internal):
```
Date: [Date reported]
Customer: [Name]
Order #: [Order number]
Part #: [Part number affected]
Lot/Batch: [If available on packaging]

Issue Description:
[What's wrong?]

Photos: [Attached/Linked]

Root Cause Assessment:
‚òê Manufacturing defect
‚òê Shipping damage
‚òê Installation damage
‚òê Uncertain (manager review)

Action Taken:
‚òê Warranty replacement shipped ([date])
‚òê Discount replacement offered
‚òê Troubleshooting resolved (no replacement)

Supplier Notified: ‚òê Yes ‚òê No

Follow-Up Required: ‚òê Yes ‚òê No
```

**Why Track**: Identify patterns (bad lot/batch, specific supplier issues)

---

### Pattern Recognition

**If Multiple Customers Report Same Issue**:

**Example**: 3 customers report AN-6 90¬∞ fittings cracking at the same location

**Your Action**:
```
1. Document all reports
2. Escalate to manager: [QUALITY PATTERN]
3. Manager investigates:
   ‚Ä¢ Same lot/batch?
   ‚Ä¢ Same supplier?
   ‚Ä¢ Manufacturing process issue?
4. Manager may:
   ‚Ä¢ Quarantine inventory (stop selling until inspected)
   ‚Ä¢ Contact supplier (defect claim)
   ‚Ä¢ Recall/replace proactively (contact all buyers)
```

**Critical**: Patterns indicate serious quality issues that must be addressed immediately

---

## üè≠ Supplier Coordination

### When to Involve Supplier

**Manager Handles Supplier Communication** (Not Operators)

**Operators Report To Manager**:
- Quality pattern detected (3+ similar defects)
- Major defect (safety concern)
- High defect rate (>5% of lot/batch)
- Customer reports injury or property damage

**Manager Coordinates**:
- Supplier quality claim
- Replacement inventory request
- Root cause analysis
- Corrective action from supplier
- Possible supplier change (if persistent issues)

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

**1. Believe the Customer** (Usually)
- Most customers are honest
- If they say it's defective, investigate thoroughly
- Benefit of doubt on borderline cases

**2. Act Fast**
- Ship replacement same day
- Don't make customer wait while you "investigate"
- Make it right first, analyze later

**3. Use as Learning Opportunity**
- Ask customer to return defective part (learn from it)
- Share findings with team (prevent future issues)
- Improve quality checks

**4. Document Everything**
- Photos, dates, customer comments
- Helps identify patterns
- Supports supplier claims

### Don'ts ‚ùå

**1. Don't Blame Customer**
- ‚ùå "You probably installed it wrong"
- ‚úÖ "Let's figure out what happened"

**2. Don't Delay Resolution**
- ‚ùå "We need to investigate before sending replacement"
- ‚úÖ "Replacement ships today, let's investigate in parallel"

**3. Don't Ignore Patterns**
- ‚ùå "Just another defect, ship replacement, move on"
- ‚úÖ "This is the 3rd AN-6 90¬∞ crack this week - escalate!"
