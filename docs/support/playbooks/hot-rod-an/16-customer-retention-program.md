# Customer Retention Program

**Customer**: Hot Rod AN  
**Purpose**: Win-back campaigns, loyalty recognition, VIP progression  
**Target Audience**: Support managers, customer success team  
**Created**: October 12, 2025

---

## üéØ Retention Framework

### Why Retention Matters

**Cost to Acquire vs Retain**:
- New customer acquisition: $50-100 (marketing, first-order discount)
- Retain existing customer: $5-10 (email, small incentive)
- **10X cheaper to retain than acquire!**

**Customer Lifetime Value**:
- First order: $100 average
- Repeat customers (5+ orders): $500-1,000 lifetime
- Loyal advocates: $2,000-5,000+ lifetime (plus referrals!)

**Goal**: Turn first-time buyers into repeat customers into loyal advocates

## üìä Customer Segmentation

### Active Customers (Last 90 Days)
**Status**: Healthy, buying regularly  
**Action**: Maintain relationship, encourage loyalty  
**Tactics**: Thank you notes, loyalty rewards, early access

### At-Risk (90-180 Days Since Last Order)
**Status**: Warning, may be churning  
**Action**: Re-engage, offer incentive  
**Tactics**: Win-back email, discount offer, feedback request

### Churned (180+ Days Since Last Order)
**Status**: Lost, inactive  
**Action**: Major win-back effort or accept loss  
**Tactics**: Large discount (20-30%), personal outreach, survey
