## Part 1: Installing AN Fittings (Basic Straight Connection)

### Step 1: Prepare the Components

**1.1 Inspect All Fittings**
```
Visual inspection checklist:
• No cracks or damage to fitting body
• Threads clean and undamaged
• 37° flare cone smooth and scratch-free
• No debris in fitting ports
```

**1.2 Clean Everything**
```
1. Spray all fitting threads with brake cleaner
2. Wipe with clean, lint-free cloth
3. Blow out with compressed air (if available)
4. Inspect sealing surfaces for debris
```

**Why This Matters:**  
Even a tiny speck of dirt can prevent proper sealing!

---

### Step 2: Thread the Fitting (Hand Start)

**2.1 Start by Hand**
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Never start with a wrench!

1. Hold female fitting (component side)
2. Turn male fitting COUNTER-clockwise until you feel a "click"
   (This aligns the threads to the starting point)
3. NOW turn clockwise—should thread smoothly by hand
4. Thread on 3-4 full turns by hand
```

**If it won't thread easily:**
- STOP! Don't force it
- Back out and try again
- If still difficult, inspect threads for damage or debris

**2.2 Hand-Tighten**
```
Continue threading by hand until:
• Fitting is snug (can't turn easily by hand)
• Both sides of connection touch
• No more than finger-tight at this point
```

---

### Step 3: Wrench Tighten (Final Torque)

**3.1 Two-Wrench Method**
```
1. Place one wrench on each side of the connection
2. Hold one side steady (typically the component)
3. Turn the other side clockwise
4. Tighten until snug
5. Add 1/8 to 1/4 turn past snug
6. STOP—do not over-tighten!
```

**Visual Guide:**
```
    ┌─────────┐
    │Component│
    └────┬────┘
         │
    [Wrench 1] ← Hold steady
         │
    ═════●═════ ← Connection point
         │
    [Wrench 2] ← Turn clockwise
         │
      ┌──┴──┐
      │Hose │
      └─────┘
```

**Torque Feel:**
- **Too Loose**: Fitting turns easily, threads not fully engaged
- **Just Right**: Snug, requires moderate force, 1/8-1/4 turn past snug
- **Too Tight**: Excessive force needed, fitting won't turn further

---

### Step 4: Leak Test

**4.1 Pressure Test (If Fuel System)**
```
1. Reconnect battery (if disconnected)
2. Turn ignition to ON (don't start engine)
3. Electric pump runs for 2-3 seconds, pressurizes system
4. Inspect all fittings for leaks
5. Look for:
   • Visible fuel seepage
   • Wet spots
   • Fuel smell
```

**4.2 If Leak Detected**
```
1. Turn off fuel system
2. Tighten fitting 1/16 turn more
3. Test again
4. If still leaking after 1/4 turn total:
   → Disassemble and inspect for damage/debris
   → Don't just keep tightening!
```

## Part 2: Installing Braided Stainless Hose with AN Hose Ends

### Overview

Braided hose systems use two parts:
1. **Socket** (outer sleeve that captures the braid)
2. **Nipple** (inner piece that screws into socket and seals on liner)

---

### Step 1: Cut the Hose

**1.1 Measure and Mark**
```
1. Measure distance between fittings
2. Add 1-2" for fitting assembly length
3. Mark cut line with marker
4. Use straight edge for square cut
```

**1.2 Cut Cleanly**
```
Best tools:
• Fine-tooth hacksaw (wrap tape around hose to prevent fray)
• Abrasive cut-off wheel (Dremel tool)
• Sharp utility knife (multiple passes)

Goal: Clean, square cut with minimal braid fray
```

**1.3 Secure the Braid**
```
Optional but helpful:
• Wrap cut end with masking tape to prevent fray
• Remove tape after assembly complete
```

---

### Step 2: Prepare the Hose End

**2.1 Push Back the Outer Braid**
```
1. Push back stainless braid 1/2" to expose inner liner
2. Use fingers or small screwdriver to separate
3. Goal: See the rubber/PTFE inner liner clearly
```

**Visual:**
```
Before:
[═══════════════] ← Outer braid over liner

After:
[════════|      ] ← Braid pushed back, liner exposed
         ↑
    Exposed liner
```

**2.2 Trim the Inner Liner**
```
1. Measure 1/4" from end of liner
2. Cut ONLY the liner (not the braid) with razor blade
3. Remove this 1/4" section of liner
4. This creates space for nipple to grip
```

**Why This Matters:**  
The nipple needs to push onto bare liner to create the seal!

---

### Step 3: Install the Socket

**3.1 Slide Socket Over Hose**
```
1. Thread socket onto hose (threads facing the cut end)
2. Push socket all the way onto hose until it bottoms out
3. Socket should cover the exposed braid completely
```

**Check:**
- Socket threads visible at hose end
- Braid captured inside socket
- Socket pushed fully onto hose

---

### Step 4: Install the Nipple

**4.1 Thread Nipple into Socket**
```
1. Align nipple with socket threads
2. Start threading clockwise by hand
3. Nipple will push onto inner liner as you thread
4. Continue until nipple is fully seated
5. Use wrench to tighten final 1/8 turn
```

**What You Should Feel:**
- First few turns: Easy threading
- Middle turns: Resistance increases (nipple pushing onto liner)
- Final turn: Snug, requires wrench

**4.2 Verify Assembly**
```
Check:
• Nipple fully seated in socket
• No gaps between nipple and socket
• Hose can't pull out (tug test)
• Outer braid captured between socket and nipple
```

---

### Step 5: Repeat for Other End

```
Repeat Steps 1-4 for the other end of the hose.

Pro Tip: Assemble one end, install on vehicle, then measure 
and cut second end to exact length needed (prevents measurement errors).
```

---

## Part 3: Installing Push-Lock Hose System (Budget Alternative)

### Overview
Push-lock hose uses **barbed fittings**—no tools required, just push on!

---

### Step 1: Cut Hose to Length

```
1. Measure distance between fittings
2. Add 2-3" per end for fitting insertion
3. Cut with sharp blade (clean, square cut)
4. Deburr inside and outside edges
```

---

### Step 2: Prep the Barbed Fitting

**2.1 Lubricate Barbs (Optional)**
```
• Small amount of motor oil or soapy water on barbs
• Makes insertion easier
• DO NOT use grease or petroleum jelly
```

---

### Step 3: Push Hose onto Barbs

**3.1 Installation**
```
1. Align hose with barbed fitting
2. Push firmly until hose seats against fitting collar
3. Twist slightly while pushing (helps barbs engage)
4. Push until you feel it bottom out
```

**How Far to Push:**
- Hose should cover all barbs
- Should reach the smooth collar at base of barbs
- Typically 1-1.5" insertion depth

**3.2 Security Check**
```
• Tug test: Hose shouldn't pull off
• Visual: All barbs covered by hose
• No gaps between hose and fitting collar
```

---

### Step 4: No Clamps Needed!

Push-lock hose is designed to seal without clamps. The barbs grip the inner diameter of the hose.

**When to Use Clamps (Optional):**
- High-vibration applications
- Extra security for racing
- Customer peace of mind

---

## Part 4: Installing Adapters (NPT to AN, ORB to AN)

### NPT to AN Adapters (Tapered Pipe Thread)

**4.1 Identify NPT Threads**
```
NPT threads are TAPERED (get smaller toward the end)
• Common on fuel pumps, pressure gauges
• Require thread sealant
```

**4.2 Apply Thread Sealant**
```
1. Clean NPT threads thoroughly
2. Apply Teflon tape:
   • Wrap clockwise (direction of threading)
   • 2-3 wraps
   • Press firmly to set tape
3. OR apply liquid thread sealant (like Permatex)
   • 2-3 drops on threads
   • DO NOT apply to first 2 threads
```

**4.3 Thread in Adapter**
```
1. Start by hand (2-3 turns)
2. Tighten with wrench until snug
3. Tapered threads will tighten significantly at end
4. Stop when fully seated (don't over-tighten)
```

**Proper Torque:**
- Hand tight + 1-2 turns with wrench
- Should feel very tight at end (tapered threads)

---

### ORB to AN Adapters (O-Ring Boss)

**4.1 Identify ORB Threads**
```
ORB threads are STRAIGHT with O-ring groove
• Common on fuel pressure regulators, modern fuel pumps
• Seal with O-ring, not threads
```

**4.2 Install O-Ring**
```
1. Inspect O-ring for damage
2. Lightly lubricate with motor oil (helps installation)
3. Seat O-ring in groove on adapter
4. Ensure O-ring not twisted or pinched
```

**4.3 Thread in Adapter**
```
1. Start by hand (O-ring creates resistance)
2. Thread until O-ring contacts sealing surface
3. Tighten additional 1/4 to 1/2 turn
4. O-ring compresses and seals
```

**Proper Torque:**
- Hand tight + 1/4-1/2 turn with wrench
- Less torque than AN fittings (O-ring does the sealing)

```

---

### Step-by-Step System Installation

**Phase 1: Plan the Layout**
```
1. Measure routing from tank to carburetor
2. Identify mounting locations for pump, filter, regulator
3. Determine fitting types needed (straight, 45°, 90°)
4. Calculate total hose length needed
5. Order parts with 10% extra for mistakes
```

**Phase 2: Install in Order**
```
1. Fuel pump (closest to tank)
2. Fuel filter (after pump)
3. Fuel pressure regulator (before carburetor)
4. Main feed line to carburetor
5. Return line from regulator to tank
```

**Phase 3: Secure and Route**
```
1. Use mounting brackets every 12-18"
2. Avoid sharp bends (use 45° or 90° fittings instead)
3. Keep lines away from heat sources (headers, exhaust)
4. Route through firewall with bulkhead fitting
5. Secure with cushioned P-clamps
```

**Phase 4: Test and Verify**
```
1. Visual inspection of all connections
2. Turn on pump without starting engine
3. Check for leaks at each fitting
4. Measure fuel pressure (install gauge)
5. Adjust regulator to correct pressure
6. Start engine and recheck all fittings
7. Test drive and recheck after 50 miles
```

## Common Installation Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Over-Tightening
**Problem**: Crushes flare, damages threads  
**Solution**: Snug + 1/8 to 1/4 turn, no more  

### Mistake #2: Starting with Wrench
**Problem**: Cross-threads fitting immediately  
**Solution**: Always start by hand, 3-4 turns before using wrench  

### Mistake #3: Using Thread Sealant on AN Flare
**Problem**: Prevents proper metal-to-metal seal  
**Solution**: NO sealant on AN flare fittings (NPT adapters only!)  

### Mistake #4: Not Removing Inner Liner (Braided Hose)
**Problem**: Nipple can't grip liner, hose leaks or blows off  
**Solution**: Always remove 1/4" of inner liner before assembly  

### Mistake #5: Mixing Fitting Types
**Problem**: AN flare into ORB port = will never seal  
**Solution**: Use correct adapter for each port type  

### Mistake #6: Sharp Bends in Hose
**Problem**: Kinks hose, restricts flow  
**Solution**: Use angled fittings (45°/90°) instead of bending hose  

### Mistake #7: Not Testing Before Driving
**Problem**: Leak causes fire on first drive  
**Solution**: Pressure test system, let sit 30 minutes, recheck before driving
