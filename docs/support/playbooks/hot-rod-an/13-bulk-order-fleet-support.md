## üì¶ Handling Large Single Orders

### Orders $2,500-$5,000

**Process**:
```
1. Flag for review: [LARGE ORDER]
2. Verify order accuracy:
   ‚Ä¢ Part numbers correct?
   ‚Ä¢ Quantities make sense?
   ‚Ä¢ Customer understands what they're ordering?
3. Offer small discount (5%, operator can approve)
4. Process normally
5. Manager reviews post-order
```

**Operator Can Approve**: 5% discount for orders $2,500+

---

### Orders $5,000-$10,000

**Process**:
```
1. Tag: [HIGH-VALUE ORDER]
2. Escalate to manager BEFORE processing
3. Manager may offer:
   ‚Ä¢ Volume discount (10-12%)
   ‚Ä¢ Free shipping
   ‚Ä¢ Priority fulfillment
4. Manager approves, operator processes
```

**Why Escalate**: Large orders merit negotiation, relationship building

---

### Orders >$10,000

**Process**:
```
1. Tag: [MAJOR ORDER]
2. Escalate to manager immediately
3. Manager handles directly:
   ‚Ä¢ Custom pricing negotiation
   ‚Ä¢ Payment terms discussion
   ‚Ä¢ Potential shop account setup
   ‚Ä¢ White-glove service
```

**Manager Handles**: All interaction with customer (too valuable for standard process)

---

## üîÑ Repeat Bulk Order Customers

### Recognizing Patterns

**Check Order History**:
- Multiple large orders (3+ orders >$1,000)
- Regular ordering pattern (monthly, quarterly)
- Similar products each time (stocking inventory)

**Example**:
```
Customer: John's Performance Shop
Order History:
‚Ä¢ 3 months ago: $2,800 (AN fittings variety pack)
‚Ä¢ 2 months ago: $3,200 (braided hose bulk)
‚Ä¢ 1 month ago: $2,500 (adapters and regulators)

Pattern: Regular large orders, likely shop inventory

Action: Flag for shop account setup
```

**Your Response**:
```
"Hi John,

I notice you order regularly from us (3 orders in 3 months!).
We really appreciate your business!

Have you considered a shop account? You'd get:
‚Ä¢ 10-15% volume discount (automatic)
‚Ä¢ Net-30 payment terms (better cash flow)
‚Ä¢ Dedicated account rep (faster service)

Would save you about $[calculated amount] per year!

Interested? I can have our manager set this up for you.

Best,
[Your Name]"
```

**Benefits**:
- Convert regular customer to shop account (higher LTV)
- Formalize relationship (less likely to switch to competitor)
- Better service for customer (they appreciate it)

## üöö Handling Bulk Shipments

### Shipping Considerations for Large Orders

**Standard Shipping** (up to 50 lbs):
- UPS/FedEx ground or expedited
- Normal rates apply
- Residential or commercial delivery

**LTL Freight** (50-500 lbs):
- Less-than-truckload freight carrier
- Requires commercial address with loading dock or forklift
- 3-7 business days transit
- More cost-effective for very large orders

**Pallet Shipments** (500+ lbs):
- Full pallet, shrink-wrapped
- Freight terminal pickup OR delivery with liftgate
- Advance scheduling required
- Best pricing per-unit

**Your Role**:
```
For orders >50 lbs:
1. Calculate weight
2. Determine shipping method (standard vs freight)
3. If freight: Escalate to manager (special quoting)
4. If standard: Process normally
```
