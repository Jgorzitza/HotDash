# Production Deployment Runbook

## Overview

This runbook describes the process for deploying the HotDash application to production on Fly.io.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] All CI checks passing on main branch
- [ ] Staging deployment successful and healthy
- [ ] Manager approval obtained
- [ ] Deployment window: Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm PT
- [ ] FLY_API_TOKEN configured in GitHub Secrets

## Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to GitHub Actions**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Jgorzitza/HotDash/actions/workflows/deploy-production.yml

2. **Click "Run workflow"**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Reason: Describe the deployment (e.g., "Deploy v1.0.0 with new dashboard features")
   - Skip staging check: Leave unchecked (only check for emergencies)

3. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Watch the workflow progress
   - Verify each job completes successfully:
     - Pre-deployment validation
     - Build
     - Deploy
     - Health check
   - If health check fails, automatic rollback will trigger

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check app URL: https://hotdash-production.fly.dev
   - Verify health endpoint: https://hotdash-production.fly.dev/health
   - Check Fly.io status: `fly status -a hotdash-production`

## Rollback Process

### Automated Rollback (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to GitHub Actions**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Jgorzitza/HotDash/actions/workflows/rollback-production.yml

2. **Click "Run workflow"**
   - Target version: Leave empty for previous version, or specify version number
   - Reason: Describe why rollback is needed (REQUIRED)

3. **Monitor Rollback**
   - Watch the workflow progress
   - Verify rollback completes in < 2 minutes
   - Check health verification passes

4. **Verify Rollback**
   - Check app is healthy: https://hotdash-production.fly.dev
   - Verify correct version deployed
   - Check Fly.io status: `fly status -a hotdash-production`

## Health Checks

### Automated Health Checks

The deployment workflow automatically performs health checks:
1. Tries `/health` endpoint (expects HTTP 200)
2. Falls back to `/` endpoint (expects HTTP 200 or 302)
3. Verifies Fly.io machine status

### Manual Health Checks

```bash
# Check HTTP endpoints
curl -I https://hotdash-production.fly.dev/health
curl -I https://hotdash-production.fly.dev/

# Check Fly.io status
fly status -a hotdash-production

# Check logs
fly logs -a hotdash-production

# Check machine health
fly checks list -a hotdash-production
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- **Uptime:** Target â‰¥ 99.9% (30-day)
- **Response Time:** P95 < 3s
- **Error Rate:** < 0.5%
- **Deployment Success Rate:** > 95%
- **Rollback Time:** < 5 minutes

### Monitoring Tools

- Fly.io Dashboard: https://fly.io/apps/hotdash-production/monitoring
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/Jgorzitza/HotDash/actions
- Application Logs: `fly logs -a hotdash-production`

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails

1. **Check CI Status**
   - Verify all CI checks passed on main
   - Review GitHub Actions logs

2. **Check Staging Health**
   - Verify staging is healthy
   - Test staging deployment first

3. **Check Secrets**
   - Verify all required secrets are configured
   - Check for expired credentials

4. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   fly logs -a hotdash-production
   ```

5. **Rollback if Needed**
   - Use automated rollback workflow

### Health Check Fails

1. **Check Application Logs**
   ```bash
   fly logs -a hotdash-production --tail
   ```

2. **Check Machine Status**
   ```bash
   fly status -a hotdash-production
   fly checks list -a hotdash-production
   ```

3. **Restart Machine**
   ```bash
   fly machine restart <machine-id> -a hotdash-production
   ```

4. **Rollback if Persistent**
   - Use rollback workflow
   - Investigate issue in staging
