# Shopify Dry Run Checklist — Support Lead

## Purpose
Ensure support delivers a disciplined rehearsal of the HotDash Shopify Admin app on 2025-10-16. This checklist captures the prep, live-run, and follow-up steps required to keep operators, enablement, and product aligned while gathering evidence for launch readiness.

### Day-of Run (2025-10-16)
#### Pre-Session (T-1h)
- Launch staging OCC and verify login + tile load.
- Confirm Zoom/recording setup + backup recorder.
- Post quick reminder in `#occ-ops` with access tips and parking lot expectations.

#### Live Session Duties
- Facilitate per agenda (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`), watching timing.
- Capture questions + blockers in `docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md` (tag owner + due date).
- Log decision IDs, telemetry observations, and attendee quotes during each scenario.
- Monitor feature flags + data freshness; flag anomalies immediately in chat.
- Reference the rate-limit playbook if Shopify throttling occurs mid-session; capture evidence per checklist above.

#### Immediate Post-Session (within 2h)
1. Upload recordings, chat logs, screenshots, and decision log excerpts to `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/`.
2. Publish Memory summary (`scope="ops"`, `topic="dry_run_2025-10-16"`) with success metrics + follow-ups.
3. Update `feedback/support.md` (new dated section) summarizing outcomes, blockers, next steps.
4. Notify product, enablement, and manager in Slack with Memory + artifact links.

### Day +1 Follow-Through (2025-10-17)
- Ensure action owners have tickets or tasks logged (Linear, Slack threads, Feedback docs).
- Update job aids/runbooks with confirmed changes from session feedback; request reviews as needed.
- Coordinate with integrations on any Shopify credential or deploy adjustments identified.
- Prep for production go-live checklist (`docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md`) incorporating dry run learnings.

### Evidence Staging Table
| Evidence Item | Path (repo or artifact) | Prepared By | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supabase parity snapshot | `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json` | Product | ✅ Ready | Attach to Linear/Memory when backlog lifts |
| Synthetic smoke (`?mock=0`) response header | `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/mock0-smoke.png` (placeholder) | Reliability | ⏳ Awaiting green response | Replace placeholder once redeploy succeeds |
| Curl transcript (`?mock=0`) | `artifacts/integrations/shopify/<date>/curl_mock0_<timestamp>.log` | Support | ⏳ Pending | Template staged; run immediately after DEPLOY-147 bundle |
| Mock-mode modal screenshots | `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/screenshots/mock/` | QA | ✅ Ready | Swap with live-mode gallery post-QA sign-off |
| Credential receipt log | `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md` | Deployment | ⏳ Pending | Populate with invite recipients + timestamps |
| Operator comms broadcast | `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md` §2B | Support ↔ Marketing | ✅ Template staged | Send once evidence table shows all ✅ |

## Evidence & Logging Requirements
- Store all media + logs under `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/` (screenshots, recordings, metrics, decision IDs).
- Maintain chronological entries in `feedback/support.md`; mirror cross-team dependencies in `feedback/enablement.md`, `feedback/product.md`, `feedback/integrations.md`, and `feedback/reliability.md` as applicable.
- Reference this checklist in post-run communications to demonstrate completion and highlight outstanding items.

## Risk & Escalation Triggers
- **Credentials:** Any missing Shopify/Chatwoot/Supabase credential ≤24h before session → escalate to deployment + manager.
- **Data parity:** Nightly metrics or seeded conversations unavailable by T-12h → notify data/reliability; prepare mocked walkthrough fallback.
- **Feature drift:** UI deviations from runbooks/job aids → capture screenshots, alert product, and document in Q&A + feedback logs.
