# Shopify Dry Run Checklist ‚Äî Support Lead

## Purpose
Ensure support delivers a disciplined rehearsal of the HotDash Shopify Admin app on 2025-10-16. This checklist captures the prep, live-run, and follow-up steps required to keep operators, enablement, and product aligned while gathering evidence for launch readiness.

**Support Inbox:** customer.support@hotrodan.com ‚Äî route all operator comms and evidence handoffs through this address.

## Shared Inbox Routing Preflight (Support)
- Objective: Ensure the customer.support@hotrodan.com inbox routes into Chatwoot with correct team assignment and sender identity before live rehearsals.
- References: artifacts/support/coordination/chatwoot_inbox_request.md; evidence folder artifacts/support/screenshots/chatwoot_inbox/
- Tasks:
  1. Verify staging-only inbound test creates a conversation in the correct Chatwoot inbox; capture a redacted screenshot.
  2. Verify outbound reply uses the correct From identity; store redacted headers excerpt.
  3. Confirm routing rules (owners, after-hours) and update notes with SLAs and contacts.
- Evidence: Store artifacts under artifacts/support/screenshots/chatwoot_inbox/ and link in feedback/support.md.

## QA Evidence Hold ‚Äî 2025-10-10
- ‚õî **Status:** Staging rehearsals remain paused until QA posts the green `?mock=0` curl + synthetic evidence set.
- üîÑ **Coordination:** Continue prepping materials but do not run live walk-throughs; brief enablement + marketing via customer.support@hotrodan.com that invites/comms stay in draft.
- üõ† **Prep Work:** Maintain mock-mode rehearsals only, keep evidence folders staged, and line up notification copy so we can relaunch within 2h of QA‚Äôs green signal.
- üóÇ **Operator Q&A:** Collect questions/answers asynchronously (#, email) and log them in `docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md` so facilitators have fresh context once the hold lifts.
- üìù **Logging:** Capture all updates/blockers in `feedback/support.md`; mirror dependencies in partner feedback logs so stakeholders know the hold rationale.
- üì° **Chatwoot Fly cut-over:** Track reliability‚Äôs Fly migration updates (`docs/deployment/chatwoot_fly_runbook.md`), stage cut-over comms drafts, and keep `scripts/ops/chatwoot-fly-smoke.sh` refreshed with the announced host/token so the smoke can run the moment reliability signals go-live.

## Evidence & Logging Requirements
- Store all media + logs under `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/` (screenshots, recordings, metrics, decision IDs).

- Reference this checklist in post-run communications to demonstrate completion and highlight outstanding items.

## Risk & Escalation Triggers
- **Credentials:** Any missing Shopify/Chatwoot/Supabase credential ‚â§24h before session ‚Üí escalate to deployment + manager.
- **Data parity:** Nightly metrics or seeded conversations unavailable by T-12h ‚Üí notify data/reliability; prepare mocked walkthrough fallback.
- **Feature drift:** UI deviations from runbooks/job aids ‚Üí capture screenshots, alert product, and document in Q&A + feedback logs.
