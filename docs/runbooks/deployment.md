  ```
- [ ] **Verify migration success**:
  ```bash
  ./bin/migrate status
  psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -c "SELECT version FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 5;"
  ```
- [ ] **Update database indexes**:
  ```bash
  ./bin/rake db:indexes:update
  ```

### Step 9: Service Startup
- [ ] **Start application services**:
  ```bash
  systemctl start application
  systemctl start web-server
  ```
- [ ] **Verify service status**:
  ```bash
  systemctl status application
  systemctl status web-server
  ps aux | grep application
  ```

### Step 10: Health Checks
- [ ] **Basic connectivity tests**:
  ```bash
  curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
  curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/status
  ```
- [ ] **Database connectivity**:
  ```bash
  ./bin/rails runner "puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute('SELECT 1').first"
  ```
- [ ] **External service integration**:
  ```bash
  ./bin/rails runner "puts ExternalService.health_check"
  ```
