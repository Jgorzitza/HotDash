# Agent Startup (Daily)

- [ ] Read your direction: `docs/directions/<agent>.md`
- [ ] Open assigned Issue(s); copy DoD locally
- [ ] Validate tools via MCP: Shopify Admin, Supabase, Chatwoot
- [ ] Start feedback: `feedback/<agent>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`
- [ ] Work **only** in Allowed paths; reference Issue in commits
- [ ] Do not declare "done" â€” push PR that satisfies DoD + tests
