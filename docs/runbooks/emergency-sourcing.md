# Emergency Sourcing Runbook

## Overview
This runbook provides decision-making frameworks and procedures for emergency sourcing situations, including opportunity cost analysis and rapid procurement processes to minimize business disruption.

## Prerequisites
- Identified critical need or shortage
- Understanding of business impact
- Access to emergency procurement authority
- Vendor contact information readily available

## Emergency Sourcing Decision Tree

### Step 1: Assess Criticality and Impact

#### Immediate Assessment
- [ ] **Determine urgency level**:
  - Critical (business stops): 0-4 hours
  - High (significant impact): 4-24 hours
  - Medium (operational impact): 24-72 hours
  - Low (planning impact): 72+ hours
- [ ] **Calculate business impact**:
  - Revenue loss per hour/day
  - Customer impact assessment
  - Operational disruption cost
  - Reputation risk evaluation

#### Impact Analysis Framework
```
Criticality Matrix:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Business Impact │ High         │ Medium       │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Revenue Loss      │ >$10K/hour  │ $1K-$10K/hr │
│ Customer Impact │ >100 customers│ 10-100 cust │
│ Operations      │ Complete stop│ Major delay │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### Step 2: Opportunity Cost Analysis

#### Cost-Benefit Framework
- [ ] **Calculate opportunity costs**:
  - **Wait cost**: Revenue lost while waiting for standard procurement
  - **Premium cost**: Additional cost for expedited sourcing
  - **Alternative cost**: Cost of alternative solutions
  - **Risk cost**: Potential for further delays or complications

#### Decision Matrix
```
Opportunity Cost Analysis:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Scenario        │ Standard     │ Emergency    │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Timeline        │ 5-10 days    │ 1-2 days     │
│ Cost            │ $X           │ $X + 25-50%  │
│ Risk            │ Low          │ Medium       │
│ Business Impact│ High loss    │ Minimal loss │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

#### Decision Criteria
- **Proceed with emergency sourcing if**:
  - Opportunity cost > 3x premium cost
  - Business impact > $50K in first 48 hours

  - System integration
  - Go-live verification
- [ ] **Monitoring and support**:
  - Initial performance monitoring
  - Issue resolution procedures
  - Vendor support coordination
  - Success metrics tracking

## Decision Tree Examples

### Scenario 1: Critical Equipment Failure
```
Equipment Failure → Business Impact Assessment
├─ Revenue Loss > $10K/hour → Emergency Sourcing
├─ Customer Impact > 100 users → Emergency Sourcing
├─ Regulatory Compliance Risk → Emergency Sourcing
└─ Operational Impact < $5K/hour → Standard Process
```

### Scenario 2: Supply Chain Disruption
```
Supply Disruption → Timeline Assessment
├─ < 24 hours to resolve → Wait and Monitor
├─ 24-72 hours → Alternative Sourcing
├─ > 72 hours → Emergency Sourcing
└─ Unknown timeline → Emergency Sourcing
```

### Scenario 3: Regulatory Compliance
```
Compliance Requirement → Risk Assessment
├─ Immediate compliance needed → Emergency Sourcing
├─ Grace period available → Standard Process
├─ Alternative solutions exist → Evaluate Options
└─ No alternatives → Emergency Sourcing
```

## Cost Analysis Templates

### Opportunity Cost Calculation
```
Formula: Opportunity Cost = (Revenue Loss Rate × Hours Delayed) + (Customer Impact Cost) + (Reputation Risk Cost)

Example:
- Revenue Loss: $5,000/hour
- Hours Delayed: 48 hours
- Customer Impact: $10,000
- Reputation Risk: $25,000
- Total Opportunity Cost: $275,000
```

### Emergency Sourcing Cost
```
Formula: Emergency Cost = (Standard Cost × Premium Factor) + (Expedited Shipping) + (Emergency Fees)

Example:
- Standard Cost: $50,000
- Premium Factor: 1.5x
- Expedited Shipping: $5,000
- Emergency Fees: $2,500
- Total Emergency Cost: $82,500
```

### ROI Calculation
```
Formula: ROI = (Opportunity Cost - Emergency Cost) / Emergency Cost × 100

Example:
- Opportunity Cost: $275,000
- Emergency Cost: $82,500
- ROI = ($275,000 - $82,500) / $82,500 × 100 = 233%
```
