# Manager Cycle ‚Äî Simple Task List (End-to-End)

**Purpose**: Execute one complete manager coordination cycle  
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes per cycle (was 2-3 hours with markdown reading)  
**Time Savings**: 1.5-2.5 hours via database queries  
**Frequency**: Daily (or when CEO requests direction update)

---

## ASSUMPTIONS (Pre-Set ‚Äî Don't Rehash)

- Dev agents: Interactive only (Manager-invoked)
- Live app agents: On-demand + nightly jobs (inventory reconcile 02:00 America/Los_Angeles)
- Canonical domain: `fm8vte-ex.myshopify.com`
- GA4 property: 339826228
- PII Card: Operator-only (city/region/country, postal prefix, masked email/phone, last-4 order ID, last tracking event, line items)

---

## 1) QUERY STATUS (< 1 min) [DATABASE-DRIVEN - NEW]

**Objective**: Get instant snapshot of all 17 agents (replaces 30min feedback reading)

**Steps**:

```bash
cd ~/HotDash/hot-dash

# Create output directory
mkdir -p artifacts/manager/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Query 1: Blocked tasks (< 1 sec)
echo "Querying blocked tasks..."
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-blocked-tasks.ts > artifacts/manager/$DATE/blocked-tasks.txt

# Query 2: Agent status (< 1 sec)
echo "Querying agent status..."
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-agent-status.ts > artifacts/manager/$DATE/agent-status.txt

# Query 3: Completed today (< 1 sec)
echo "Querying completed work..."
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/manager/query-completed-today.ts > artifacts/manager/$DATE/completed.txt

echo "‚úÖ Status queries complete (< 10 seconds total)"
echo "üìä Results:"
echo "   Blocked: artifacts/manager/$DATE/blocked-tasks.txt"
echo "   Status: artifacts/manager/$DATE/agent-status.txt"
echo "   Completed: artifacts/manager/$DATE/completed.txt"
```

**Output**: 3 query result files (instant status of all agents)

**Time**: < 10 seconds (vs 30 minutes reading markdown files)

**Acceptance**:

- All 3 queries run successfully
- Blocked tasks identified
- Agent status shows current work
- Completed tasks listed with metrics

---

## 2) CONSOLIDATE (10 min) [DATABASE-DRIVEN - NEW]

**Objective**: Review query results and identify actions (replaces 45min manual consolidation)

**Lanes**:

- customer-front, accounts, storefront
- inventory, analytics, seo-perf, risk, content
- devops, integrations, data, designer, product, support, ads, ai-knowledge, qa

**Steps**:

```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Review query outputs and create summary
cat > artifacts/manager/$DATE/status-summary.md << 'EOF'
# Agent Status Summary ‚Äî [DATE]

**Generated**: Database queries (< 10 seconds)
**Method**: query-blocked-tasks.ts, query-agent-status.ts, query-completed-today.ts
**Agents**: 17

---

## BLOCKERS (Auto-Generated)

[Paste output from blocked-tasks.txt]

---

## COMPLETED TODAY (Auto-Generated)

[Paste output from completed.txt]

---

## IN PROGRESS (Auto-Generated)

[Extract from agent-status.txt - look for üîµ in_progress status]

---

## ACTION ITEMS

From query results:
- Unblock: [List dependencies from blockedBy field]
- Review: [Agents with progress <50% and >4h stale]
- Coordinate: [Task dependencies]

---

## NEXT TASKS (From Direction Files)

[Manager determines from current progress and priorities]

EOF

# Replace [DATE] with actual date
sed -i "s/\[DATE\]/$DATE/g" artifacts/manager/$DATE/status-summary.md

# Paste query results into summary
sed -i "/\[Paste output from blocked-tasks.txt\]/r artifacts/manager/$DATE/blocked-tasks.txt" artifacts/manager/$DATE/status-summary.md

echo "üìù Review the summary and:"
echo "    - Identify blockers to unblock"
echo "    - Check agents with stale progress (>4h)"
echo "    - Only read markdown files for blocked agents (deep dive)"
```

**Output**: `artifacts/manager/<DATE>/status-summary.md` (auto-generated from database)

**Time**: < 1 minute (vs 45 minutes manual consolidation)

**Acceptance**: All blockers identified, completed work summarized, in-progress tracked

---

## 3) CONFLICT CHECK (15 min) ‚Äî ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP IF ANY

**Objective**: Compare against North Star + Growth Engine pack; PAUSE if conflicts found

**Steps**:

```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Check for new features not in pack or conflicts with North Star
echo "üîç Checking for conflicts..."

# Questions to answer:
# 1. Any new features built that conflict with North Star vision?
# 2. Any features from Growth Engine pack missing or delayed?
# 3. Any security model violations (PII handling, ABAC, Dev MCP ban)?
# 4. Any evidence requirements not followed (MCP JSONL, heartbeat)?

# If YES to any ‚Üí Create conflict report
cat > artifacts/manager/$DATE/design_conflicts.md << 'EOF'
# Design Conflict Report ‚Äî [DATE]

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICTS FOUND ‚Äî CEO Approval Required Before Proceeding

---

## CONFLICT 1: [Title]

**Where**: [File/feature]
**Issue**: [What conflicts with North Star or pack]
**Impact**: [P0/P1/P2]
**Options**:
- A) [Option 1]
- B) [Option 2]

**Recommendation**: [Manager's recommendation]

---

[Repeat for each conflict]

---

## CEO DECISION REQUIRED

Please approve approach for each conflict before I proceed with direction updates.

EOF

# If conflicts found:
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICTS FOUND - Saved to artifacts/manager/$DATE/design_conflicts.md"
echo "üõë PAUSING - Do NOT proceed to step 4 until CEO approves"

# If no conflicts:
echo "‚úÖ No conflicts found - Safe to proceed"
rm artifacts/manager/$DATE/design_conflicts.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Output**: `artifacts/manager/<DATE>/design_conflicts.md` (only if conflicts exist)

**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP RULE**: If conflicts exist, PAUSE here and present to CEO. Do NOT proceed to steps 4-7 until CEO confirms.

**Acceptance**: Either no conflicts (file deleted) OR conflict report created and CEO approval obtained

---

## 4) MARK DONE & CLEAN PLAN (30 min)

**Objective**: Check off completed tasks with evidence; remove duplicates; update statuses

**Steps**:

For each agent direction file (`docs/directions/<agent>.md`):

```bash
# Read current direction
AGENT="engineer"  # Replace for each agent

# Check feedback_consolidated.md for completed tasks
# Example: If feedback shows "ENG-029: PII redaction utility COMPLETE ‚úÖ"

# Update direction file:
# 1. Add ‚úÖ to completed task
# 2. Move to "COMPLETED" section
# 3. Update status line
# 4. Keep acceptance criteria (don't delete until validated)
```

**Manual Step**: For each agent:

1. Read their completed work from `feedback_consolidated.md`
2. Update their direction file:
   - ‚úÖ Mark completed tasks
   - Keep acceptance criteria
   - Update status line (e.g., "Phase 9: 2/3 complete")
3. Do NOT delete tasks until fully validated by QA/Designer

**Acceptance**: All completed tasks marked ‚úÖ with evidence links

---

## 5) BLOCKERS FIRST (30 min)

**Objective**: Verify each blocker (5/5 checks); PRESENT to CEO for assignment

**5-Point Blocker Verification**:

For each blocker, verify:

1. ‚úÖ **Access**: Do we have credentials/permissions? (Check vault, env vars)
2. ‚úÖ **Flags**: Are feature flags/env vars set correctly?
3. ‚úÖ **Runbook**: Is there a runbook for this operation?
4. ‚úÖ **Workaround**: Can we proceed with alternative approach?
5. ‚úÖ **Repro**: Can blocker be reproduced with minimal steps?

**Document Blockers**:

```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

cat > artifacts/manager/$DATE/blockers_for_ceo.md << 'EOF'
# Blockers for CEO Assignment ‚Äî [DATE]

## BLOCKER-001: [Title]
**Type**: [Credentials | Network | Dependency | Technical]
**Impact**: [What's blocked]
**ETA**: [Estimated hours to clear]
**Verification** (5/5):
- ‚úÖ Access: [Yes/No - details]
- ‚úÖ Flags: [Yes/No - details]
- ‚úÖ Runbook: [Yes/No - create if missing]
- ‚úÖ Workaround: [Yes/No - describe]
- ‚úÖ Repro: [Yes/No - steps]

**Recommended Actions**:
- Step 1: [Specific action]
- Step 2: [Specific action]
- Evidence: [Where logged]

**Recommended Owner**: [Agent name]
**Priority**: P0/P1/P2

---

[Repeat for each blocker]

EOF

echo "‚úÖ Blockers documented: artifacts/manager/$DATE/blockers_for_ceo.md"
```

**Manual Step**:

1. Run 5-point verification for each blocker
2. Document in `blockers_for_ceo.md`
3. **PRESENT to CEO** (in conversation, not in direction files)
4. CEO assigns blockers to team
5. **PROCEED to Step 6** (assign remaining work AS IF blockers handled)

**Key Change**: Manager does NOT assign blockers to agents. CEO assigns them separately. This enables parallel execution: team clears blockers while Manager assigns new direction.

**Acceptance**: All blockers verified (5/5) and presented to CEO

---

## 6) ASSIGN WORK (60 min) ‚Äî NO IDLE AGENTS

**Objective**: Reprioritize by Revenue √ó Confidence √ó Ease; ensure every lane has tasks

**Ranking Formula**:

```
Score = Expected_Revenue √ó Confidence √ó Ease
```

**Task Sizing**: 30-120 minutes per task (no multi-day tasks)

**Steps**:

```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Create lane assignment JSON
cat > reports/manager/lanes/$DATE.json << 'EOF'
{
  "cycle_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "total_agents": 17,
  "idle_agents": 0,
  "lanes": {
    "customer-front": {
      "agent": "ai-customer",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "AI-CUSTOMER-XXX",
          "title": "Task title",
          "duration_min": 120,
          "priority": "P0",
          "score": 850,
          "dependencies": []
        }
      ]
    },
    "inventory": {
      "agent": "inventory",
      "tasks": [...]
    },
    "analytics": {
      "agent": "analytics",
      "tasks": [...]
    }
    // ... all 17 agents
  }
}
EOF

echo "‚úÖ Lane assignments: reports/manager/lanes/$DATE.json"
```

**Manual Step**: For each agent:

1. Review their current work from `feedback_consolidated.md`
2. Assign next tasks (prioritized by score)
3. Ensure NO IDLE (even maintenance work counts)
4. Update their direction file with:
   - Next task ID
   - Objective (1-2 sentences)
   - Steps (3-5 bullet points)
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Duration estimate (30-120 min)
   - Dependencies (if any)

**Validation**: Every agent has ‚â•1 assigned task

**Acceptance**: All 17 agents have active work, no STANDBY/IDLE status

---

## 7) SUMMARY OUT (15 min)

**Objective**: Post ONE Cycle Summary (shipped, blockers cleared, Top-10 next)

- [ ] Step 5: All blockers have BLOCKER-CLEAR tasks with owners & ETAs
- [ ] Step 6: All 17 agents have assigned work (NO IDLE/STANDBY)
- [ ] Step 7: Cycle summary posted (one page, evidence included)

---

## OUTPUTS (Per Cycle)

**Required Files**:

**Updated Files**:

- `docs/directions/<agent>.md` (all 17 agents) ‚Äî updated with next tasks, marked completed work
- `feedback/manager/<DATE>.md` ‚Äî cycle summary appended

---

## STOP RULES

**STOP and present to CEO if**:

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Design conflicts found (Step 3)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical blocker cannot be cleared within 24 hours (Step 5)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è >3 agents have same blocker (systemic issue)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Any agent has been idle >4 hours (protocol violation)

**Do NOT proceed past that step until CEO confirms approach.**

---

## TIME BUDGET

| Step              | Duration | Cumulative |
| ----------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1. Collect        | 30 min   | 30 min     |
| 2. Consolidate    | 45 min   | 1h 15min   |
| 3. Conflict Check | 15 min   | 1h 30min   |
| 4. Mark Done      | 30 min   | 2h         |
| 5. Blockers       | 45 min   | 2h 45min   |
| 6. Assign Work    | 60 min   | 3h 45min   |
| 7. Summary        | 15 min   | 4h         |

**Total**: ~4 hours per cycle (can parallelize Step 4 & 5 to save 30 min)

---

## EXAMPLES

### Example: Blocker Verification (5/5)

**Blocker**: "DATA-006 indexes cannot be applied (network issue)"

**Verification**:

1. ‚úÖ **Access**: Supabase credentials in vault/occ/supabase/ ‚úÖ YES
2. ‚úÖ **Flags**: DATABASE_URL env var set ‚úÖ YES (but IPv6 unreachable in WSL2)
3. ‚úÖ **Runbook**: Migration application runbook exists ‚úÖ YES (docs/runbooks/database-migration-application.md)
4. ‚úÖ **Workaround**: Can apply via Dashboard SQL Editor or IPv4 pooler ‚úÖ YES
5. ‚úÖ **Repro**: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1"` fails with network unreachable ‚úÖ YES

**BLOCKER-CLEAR Task**: "Apply DATA-006 via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (Manager, 30 min, P0)"

---

### Example: Task Assignment (No Idle)

**Agent**: Designer  
**Last Status**: "Phase 7-8 validation complete, awaiting Engineer Phase 9"  
**Risk**: Goes IDLE if Engineer delayed

**Assigned Task**: "DES-018: Review Phase 1-8 accessibility compliance report, create remediation checklist (2h, P2)"

**Why**: Keeps Designer active with productive maintenance work while waiting for dependencies

---

## NOTES

**Don't Rehash Assumptions**: No need to re-explain PII Card, domains, schedules each cycle  
**Evidence Required**: Every completed task needs evidence link (commit, artifact, test result)  
**No Idle Rule**: EVERY agent gets assigned work, even if it's maintenance/documentation  
**Conflict = STOP**: Don't proceed if Step 3 finds conflicts ‚Äî CEO must approve first

---

**Next**: Execute this cycle, then repeat daily or when CEO requests direction update.
