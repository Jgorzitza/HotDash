## üîÑ QUICK UPDATE PROMPTS (Agent Already Oriented)

**When you've updated direction files and agent already running**:

```
Manager has provided updated direction, execute
```

**What this does**:
- Agent skips to Step 3 of startup checklist
- Reads `docs/directions/<agent>.md` (START HERE NOW section)
- Executes assigned task immediately
- No full startup needed

### Manager Shutdown:
```
Execute your shutdown checklist completely: ~/HotDash/hot-dash/docs/runbooks/manager_shutdown_checklist.md

### Agent Shutdown:
```
Provide manager feedback
```

**What this does**:
- Agent opens `~/HotDash/hot-dash/docs/runbooks/agent_shutdown_checklist.md`
- Follows Steps 5-6 (Log Session End + Performance Review)
- Writes to `feedback/<agent>.md` ONLY

---

## üìã STARTUP CHECKLIST VERIFICATION

Both agent and manager startup checklists contain:

### Step 1 (Navigate):
```bash
cd ~/HotDash/hot-dash
pwd  # Verify correct location
```

**Verified**: ‚úÖ All startup files navigate to workspace first

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED AGENT STARTUP ORDER

### Phase 1: Core Blockers (Start These First)
1. Engineer (fixing build + RLS)
2. Data (fixing RLS security)
3. QA (ready to test when build fixed)

### Phase 2: Support Team (Start When Phase 1 Working)
4. Deployment (preparing production)
5. Reliability (verifying RLS)
6. Engineer-Helper (standby for Engineer)

### Phase 3: Design & Integration (Start When UI Ready)
7. Designer (reviewing UI when built)
8. Integrations (monitoring MCP health)
9. QA-Helper (standby for QA)

### Phase 4: Paused (Don't Start Yet)
10-18. AI, Chatwoot, Enablement, Support, Marketing, Product, Compliance, Localization, Git-Cleanup
- All have clear "PAUSED" status in direction files
- Will notify when ready to activate

---

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

### DO NOT:
‚ùå Point agents directly to direction files (`docs/directions/<agent>.md`)
‚ùå Say "You are engineer, execute" without the startup document reference
‚ùå Skip the startup checklist for first launch

### DO:
‚úÖ Always reference the startup checklist document path
‚úÖ Let agents replace `<your-agent>` with their actual name
‚úÖ Use "Quick Update" prompt only when agent already oriented
‚úÖ Use shutdown prompts to get clean feedback
