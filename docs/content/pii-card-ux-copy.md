## 6. Hot Rodan Brand Voice Applications

### When to Use Brand Voice

‚úÖ **Use Hot Rodan Theme**:

- Success confirmations ("Pit stop complete! üèÅ")
- Resolution messages
- Positive feedback

‚ùå **Avoid Hot Rodan Theme**:

- Error messages (need clarity over creativity)
- Validation warnings
- Sensitive/escalation situations
- PII-related explanations (privacy is serious)

### Brand Voice Examples

**Success (Issue Resolved)**

```
Standard: "Issue resolved! ‚úì"
Hot Rodan: "Pit stop complete! üèÅ" or "Back on track! üèÅ"
```

**Success (Reply Sent)**

```
Standard: "Reply sent! üì®"
Hot Rodan: "Message away! üöÄ" (optional, test with operators)
```

**Draft Saved**

```
Standard: "Draft saved"
Hot Rodan: Keep standard (saving is routine, not celebratory)
```

---

## 7. Copy Standards

### Operator-First Language

‚úÖ **DO**:

- Use active voice: "Send Reply" not "Reply will be sent"
- Be specific: "Last 4 Order ID" not just "Order ID"
- Explain why: "Masked for privacy" not just "Masked"
- Show outcomes: "Customer will receive..." not just "Sent"

‚ùå **DON'T**:

- Use jargon without explanation
- Hide important information in tooltips
- Assume operators know privacy policies
- Use vague labels like "Details" or "Info"

### Clarity Principles

1. **Field labels tell what it is**: "Email Address"
2. **Badges/annotations tell status**: "(Masked)"
3. **Tooltips tell why**: "Full email visible to you only..."
4. **Help text tells how**: "Review and edit before sending..."

### Tone Guidelines

- **Confident**: "Send Reply" not "Try to Send"
- **Helpful**: Include next steps and context
- **Professional**: Formal for privacy/policy matters
- **Friendly**: Casual for routine actions (when appropriate)

## 8. Implementation Notes for Engineer

### Dynamic Content Tokens

Use these tokens in copy strings for dynamic insertion:

```typescript
{
  customerName;
} // e.g., "Sarah Johnson"
{
  orderLast4;
} // e.g., "3847"
{
  orderDate;
} // e.g., "Oct 15, 2025"
{
  maskedEmail;
} // e.g., "j***@d***.com"
{
  maskedPhone;
} // e.g., "***-***-1234"
{
  trackingNumber;
} // e.g., "1Z999AA10123456784"
{
  characterCount;
} // e.g., "1,847" (for validation)
```

### Copy Constants

Recommend creating a copy constants file:

```typescript
// app/config/copy/pii-card.ts
export const PII_CARD_COPY = {
  sectionHeaders: {
    customerDetails: "Customer Details",
    orderInformation: "Order Information",
    shippingStatus: "Shipping Status",
  },
  fieldLabels: {
    customerName: "Customer Name",
    email: "Email Address",
    phone: "Phone Number",
    // ... etc
  },
  tooltips: {
    maskedEmail:
      "Full email visible to you only. Customer replies show masked version.",
    // ... etc
  },
  // ... etc
};
```

### Internationalization (i18n) Ready

All copy strings are designed to be easily extracted for translation if needed in future. Avoid concatenation; use full sentence strings with tokens.
