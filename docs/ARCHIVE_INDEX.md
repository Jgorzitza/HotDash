# Archive Index — 2025-10-15

This index records files moved out of active docs to reduce noise and align with our governance policy (allowed paths). All items were archived under `docs/_archive/2025-10-15-misc/`.

- Scope: marketing, enablement, compliance/evidence, pilot, ops, strategy, testing, design drafts, dev notes, and other non-essential docs for today’s sprint.
- Kept active: NORTH_STAR.md, RULES.md, OPERATING_MODEL.md, runbooks/, directions/, specs/, integrations/, manager/, mcp/.

Rationale:
- CI policy enforces allowed markdown paths; noisy or off-scope docs impede PR review.
- All archived docs remain available for reference under `_archive/`.
- Any content needed later will be reintroduced into allowed locations (e.g., specs/ or integrations/) via a PR.
