## Efficiency Definition

**Operator Efficiency** = Output (tickets resolved) / Input (time spent)

**Measurement**: Time to complete common workflows before vs after dashboard

**Target**: 50% reduction in workflow completion time

## Measurement Method

### Before/After Timing Study

**Week 0 (Pre-Launch)**:
- Observe CEO complete 10 common workflows manually
- Time each step
- Calculate average time per workflow
- Document in baseline report

**Week 1-4 (During Pilot)**:
- Track same workflows using HotDash
- Measure time using dashboard analytics
- Calculate time savings per workflow
- Compare to baseline

**Data Source**: 
- Manual: Stopwatch observation (Week 0)
- Dashboard: Analytics timestamps (Weeks 1-4)

## MCP Tool Integration

### Supabase MCP - Workflow Timing

**Log workflow events**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_timings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workflow_name VARCHAR(50),
  operator_id UUID,
  started_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  duration_seconds INT,
  method VARCHAR(20), -- 'manual' or 'dashboard'
  date DATE
);
```

**Query efficiency gains**:
```sql
SELECT 
  workflow_name,
  AVG(CASE WHEN method = 'manual' THEN duration_seconds END) as manual_avg,
  AVG(CASE WHEN method = 'dashboard' THEN duration_seconds END) as dashboard_avg,
  AVG(CASE WHEN method = 'manual' THEN duration_seconds END) - 
    AVG(CASE WHEN method = 'dashboard' THEN duration_seconds END) as seconds_saved,
  ROUND(100.0 * (1 - AVG(CASE WHEN method = 'dashboard' THEN duration_seconds END) / 
    AVG(CASE WHEN method = 'manual' THEN duration_seconds END)), 2) as efficiency_gain_pct
FROM workflow_timings
WHERE date >= '2025-10-15'
GROUP BY workflow_name;
```
