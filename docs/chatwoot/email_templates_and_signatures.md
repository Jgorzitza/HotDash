## üìù Canned Responses (Chatwoot Templates)

### 1. Shipping Timeframe

**Short Code**: `/shipping`

**Template**:
```
Thanks for your order! Most orders ship within 1-2 business days. Once shipped, you'll receive a tracking number via email.

Standard shipping typically takes 3-5 business days. Expedited shipping options are available at checkout if you need your parts sooner.

Need it for a deadline? Let us know and we'll do our best to prioritize your order!
```

### 2. AN Sizing Help

**Short Code**: `/sizing`

**Template**:
```
Happy to help with AN fitting sizing!

AN fittings use a dash size system - here's the quick conversion:
‚Ä¢ AN-4 = 1/4 inch
‚Ä¢ AN-6 = 3/8 inch (most common for street hot rods)
‚Ä¢ AN-8 = 1/2 inch
‚Ä¢ AN-10 = 5/8 inch
‚Ä¢ AN-12 = 3/4 inch

Formula: Divide the AN dash number by 16 to get inches.

For your application, can you tell me:
1. What engine/horsepower?
2. Carburetor or fuel injection?
3. Mechanical or electric fuel pump?

This will help me recommend the perfect sizing!
```

---

### 3. Return Policy

**Short Code**: `/returns`

**Template**:
```
We accept returns within 30 days of purchase for unused items in original packaging.

Return Process:
1. Email us with your order number
2. We'll provide a return authorization and shipping label
3. Ship the items back (we cover return shipping for defects)
4. Refund processed within 3-5 business days of receipt

Items must be unused and in resalable condition. AN fittings that have been installed cannot be returned for health and safety reasons.

Need to exchange for a different size? We're happy to help with that!
```

### 4. Technical Support Escalation

**Short Code**: `/technical`

**Template**:
```
For technical fitment questions, we recommend consulting with our technical specialist who can provide personalized guidance for your specific application.

Our tech specialist can help with:
‚Ä¢ Complex fuel system design
‚Ä¢ High-horsepower applications (500+ HP)
‚Ä¢ Racing applications (drag, road race, off-road)
‚Ä¢ Specialized fuels (E85, methanol, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Custom fabrication projects

Would you like me to have our technical specialist reach out to you? If so, please provide:
1. Phone number (best way to reach you)
2. Brief description of your project
3. Any specific technical questions

We'll have them contact you within 24 hours!
```

---

### 5. Order Status Inquiry

**Short Code**: `/orderstatus`

**Template**:
```
I'd be happy to check your order status! 

Can you provide your:
‚Ä¢ Order number (starts with #), OR
‚Ä¢ Email address used for the order

Once I have that, I'll pull up your order details and let you know exactly where it is in the fulfillment process.
```

### 6. Installation Help

**Short Code**: `/installation`

**Template**:
```
We're here to help with your AN fitting installation!

For step-by-step guidance, check out our installation guide: [LINK TO GUIDE]

Quick tips:
‚Ä¢ No thread sealant needed - AN fittings use 37¬∞ flare seal
‚Ä¢ Hand-tight plus 1/4 to 1/2 turn with wrench
‚Ä¢ Use two wrenches to prevent twisting hose
‚Ä¢ Pressure test before final installation

Having a specific installation issue? Let me know what's happening and I'll walk you through it!
```

---

### 7. Warranty Information

**Short Code**: `/warranty`

**Template**:
```
All Hot Rod AN products are covered by our quality guarantee:

‚Ä¢ Lifetime warranty against manufacturing defects
‚Ä¢ 30-day satisfaction guarantee (unused items)
‚Ä¢ Free replacement for defective fittings
‚Ä¢ No-hassle warranty claims

If you believe you have a defective product:
1. Send photos of the issue
2. Include your order number
3. Describe what happened

We'll process a replacement immediately if it's a manufacturing defect.

Note: Warranty doesn't cover damage from improper installation, over-tightening, or incompatible applications.
```

---

### 8. Compatibility Question

**Short Code**: `/compat`

**Template**:
```
Great question about compatibility! AN fittings are standardized, but there are some important considerations:

For your specific application, can you provide:
‚Ä¢ What are you connecting? (carburetor, fuel pump, filter, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Thread type on the component? (NPT, ORB, or already AN?)
‚Ä¢ Hose type you're using? (braided stainless, push-lock, PTFE)

This will help me confirm compatibility and recommend any adapters you might need!

General rule: AN-to-AN connections are universal. Connecting to NPT or ORB threads requires an adapter.
```
