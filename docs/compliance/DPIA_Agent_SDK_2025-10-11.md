- **Personal Data Processed:** Customer names, email addresses, message content
- **Legal Basis:** Legitimate Interest (customer support) + Consent
- **High Risks Identified:** 3 (all mitigated)
- **Recommendation:** ✅ APPROVED with documented controls

### Processing Summary
- **Data Subjects:** Customers contacting support via email/chat
- **Volume:** Estimated 50-200 conversations/month (pilot)
- **Retention:** 14 days (transcripts), 1 year (decisions/analytics)
- **Third-Party Sharing:** OpenAI (AI processing), Supabase (storage)

**Impact:** HIGH (customer privacy breach)
**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enforces conversation ownership
- ✅ JWT authentication required for all access
- ✅ Service role limited to required tables only
- ✅ Audit logging tracks all access
- ✅ Encryption at rest and in transit

**Residual Risk:** LOW

#### Risk 2: PII Sent to OpenAI Without Consent
**Description:** Customer message content may contain sensitive PII sent to third-party AI provider

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (without sanitization)
**Impact:** HIGH (GDPR violation, customer trust)
**Overall Risk:** HIGH

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ LlamaIndex PII sanitizer removes emails, phone numbers, card data
- ✅ Privacy policy discloses AI-assisted support
- ✅ Customers can opt-out and request human-only support
- ✅ OpenAI enterprise with prompt retention opt-out (DPA pending)
- ✅ Regional endpoints (EU/US) for data residency

**Residual Risk:** LOW (pending DPA confirmation)

#### Risk 3: Retention Non-Compliance

**Likelihood:** LOW (with automation)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (regulatory violation)
**Overall Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Automated retention policies (pg_cron)
- ✅ Clear retention schedules documented
- ✅ Manual deletion procedures available
- ✅ Data minimization principle applied

- No auto-send capability
- Quality metrics tracked

**Residual Risk:** LOW (operational, not privacy)

### 3.3 Low Risks
