2. **Spear Phishing** - Targeted emails using personal information
3. **Whaling** - Phishing attacks targeting executives
4. **Smishing** - Phishing via SMS text messages
5. **Vishing** - Phishing via voice calls

---

### 2.2 Recognizing Phishing Emails

**Red Flag Checklist:**

- [ ] **Urgency** - "Act now!", "Account will be suspended!"
- [ ] **Fear tactics** - Threats, warnings, consequences
- [ ] **Requests credentials** - Asks for password, credit card, 2FA code
- [ ] **Suspicious sender** - Email doesn't match company domain
- [ ] **Generic greeting** - "Dear customer" instead of your name
- [ ] **Poor grammar** - Spelling errors, awkward phrasing
- [ ] **Unexpected attachment** - Files you didn't ask for
- [ ] **Mismatched URLs** - Link text says one thing, actual URL is different

**Example Phishing Email:**
```
From: shopify-security@shopifiy.com (NOTE: misspelling!)
Subject: URGENT: Your account will be suspended

Dear Shopify User,

Your account has been flagged for suspicious activity. To avoid suspension,
click here immediately to verify your account:

[Verify Account Now] ← This links to fake-shopify.com

You have 24 hours or your account will be permanently disabled.

Shopify Security Team
```

**Red Flags in Example:**
- ❌ Misspelling in email (shopifiy vs shopify)
- ❌ Generic greeting
- ❌ Urgent threat
- ❌ Requests verification (phishing for credentials)
- ❌ Time pressure

---

### 2.3 Real vs. Fake Email Comparison

**FAKE Email (Phishing):**
```
From: security@sh0pify.com (0 instead of o)
Subject: URGENT ACTION REQUIRED

Your Shopify account has been compromised. Click here to secure it now.

[Secure My Account] (links to fake-shopify-login.com)
```

**REAL Email (Legitimate):**
```
From: no-reply@shopify.com
Subject: Shopify Login Notification

Hi [Your Name],

We noticed a new login to your Shopify account from [Location]. 
If this was you, no action needed.

If this wasn't you, secure your account:
https://accounts.shopify.com/security

Need help? Visit Shopify Help Center.

Thanks,
The Shopify Team
```

**Differences:**
- ✅ Real email uses official @shopify.com
- ✅ Personal greeting with your name
- ✅ No urgent threats or pressure
- ✅ Legitimate URL (shopify.com, not look-alike)
- ✅ Provides help center link (not login link)

---

### 2.4 What to Do If You Receive Phishing

**Step-by-Step Response:**

1. **DON'T CLICK** any links or attachments
2. **DON'T REPLY** to the email
3. **CHECK** the sender's email (hover to see real address)
4. **FORWARD** to your manager with "SUSPECTED PHISHING" in subject
5. **DELETE** the email
6. **REPORT** to IT/security team

**If You Already Clicked:**
1. ❗ Report immediately (within minutes)
2. Don't panic - quick reporting helps
3. Change your password if you entered it
4. Manager will assess if incident response needed
5. Document what happened

---

### 2.5 Phishing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Shopify Account Suspension**
```
Email: "Your Shopify account will be suspended. Click to verify."
Action: DON'T CLICK → Forward to manager → Delete
```

**Scenario 2: CEO Urgent Request** (Whaling)
```
Email from "CEO": "I need you to buy gift cards urgently for client gifts."
Action: Verify via alternate channel (call CEO) → Don't send money → Report
```

**Scenario 3: IT Password Reset**
```
Email: "IT requires password update. Click here to reset."
Action: Don't click → Contact IT directly → Verify if legitimate
```

**Scenario 4: Customer Complaint Email**
```
Suspicious email claiming to be customer with attached "proof.pdf"
Action: Don't open attachment → Verify customer via official channels → Report if suspicious
```

**Scenario 5: Invoice Phishing**
```
Email: "Overdue invoice attached. Pay immediately."
Action: Don't open → Verify with accounting → Report suspicious invoice
```

## Training Module 4: Customer Data Handling (30 minutes)

### 4.1 What is Customer Data?

- Order information
- Conversation history

**Sensitive Data We DON'T Handle:**
- Payment card numbers (Shopify stores these)
- Passwords
- Social security numbers
- Health information

---

### 4.2 Data Protection Rules

**The Golden Rule:** Only access customer data when necessary for support.

**Data Handling Dos:**
- ✅ Access only assigned conversations
- ✅ Use data only for support purposes
- ✅ Close conversations when resolved
- ✅ Let retention policies handle deletion (14 days automatic)

**Data Handling Don'ts:**
- ❌ Browse customer records for curiosity
- ❌ Copy customer data to personal devices
- ❌ Share customer data on personal email/chat
- ❌ Discuss customer details in public
- ❌ Use customer data for non-support purposes

---

### 4.3 Customer Privacy Rights

**Customers Can Request:**

1. **Access** - "Show me my data" (30 days to respond)
2. **Delete** - "Delete my data" (14 days to respond)
3. **Rectify** - "Fix incorrect information" (7 days to respond)
4. **Export** - "Give me my data in portable format" (30 days)
5. **Opt-Out of AI** - "No AI assistance" (Immediate)

**How to Handle Privacy Requests:**
1. Recognize the request (subject line: "Privacy Request")
2. Follow DSR procedure in `docs/runbooks/data_subject_requests.md`
3. Escalate to compliance team
4. Don't process manually (compliance handles it)
5. Respond within timeline

**Response Template:**
```
Thank you for your privacy request. We've forwarded this to our compliance team who will respond within [timeline] days as required by law.
```

---

### 4.4 AI-Assisted Support

**How AI Works:**
1. Customer sends message
2. AI generates suggested reply (with PII removed)
3. **YOU review and approve** (or reject/edit)
4. Only then is reply sent

**Your Responsibilities with AI:**
- ✅ Always read AI suggestions before approving
- ✅ Edit for accuracy and tone
- ✅ Reject if inappropriate or incorrect
- ✅ Report recurring AI errors
- ✅ Inform customers AI is used (if asked)

**AI Safety:**
- Personal information removed before AI processing
- AI never sends automatically
- You always have final approval
- Customers can opt out anytime

**When to Reject AI:**
- Factually incorrect
- Inappropriate tone
- Missing context
- Privacy concern
- Better to write manually

---

### 4.5 Data Retention

**How Long We Keep Data:**
- Customer messages: 14 days
- Decision logs (audit): 1 year
- Analytics (aggregated): 180 days

**Deletion:**
- Automatic (pg_cron jobs)
- You don't need to delete manually
- UNLESS: Customer requests deletion (follow DSR procedure)

**Why These Periods:**
- 14 days: Enough for follow-up support
- 1 year: Legal requirement for audit trail
- 180 days: Performance monitoring and improvement

---
