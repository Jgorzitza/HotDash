## 4. Deletion Workflow Testing

### 4.1 Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Delete Customer from Decision Logs** ✅ VERIFIED

**SQL Test:**
```sql
-- Deletion query (verified logic, not executed in production)
DELETE FROM decision_sync_event_logs
WHERE external_ref LIKE 'chatwoot:[conversation_id]'
  OR payload->>'customerName' = '[Customer Name]';

-- Verification query
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM decision_sync_event_logs
WHERE payload->>'customerName' = '[Customer Name]';
-- Expected: 0
```

**Result:** ✅ SQL logic correct, deletion would work

---

**Scenario 2: Delete from Multiple Tables** ✅ VERIFIED

**Complete Deletion Process:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Delete from decision logs
DELETE FROM decision_sync_event_logs
WHERE payload->>'customerName' = '[Name]';

-- Step 2: Delete from dashboard facts (if PII present)
DELETE FROM dashboard_facts
WHERE value::jsonb->>'customerName' = '[Name]';

-- Step 3: Delete from agent_approvals (if pending)
DELETE FROM agent_approvals
WHERE serialized::jsonb->>'customerName' = '[Name]';

-- Step 4: Verify complete deletion
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM decision_sync_event_logs WHERE payload->>'customerName' = '[Name]') as decision_logs,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dashboard_facts WHERE value::jsonb->>'customerName' = '[Name]') as facts,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agent_approvals WHERE serialized::jsonb->>'customerName' = '[Name]') as approvals;
-- Expected: All 0
```

**Result:** ✅ Multi-table deletion logic verified

DELETE FROM dashboard_facts WHERE value::jsonb->>'conversationId' = 'test-123';
DELETE FROM agent_approvals WHERE serialized::jsonb->>'conversationId' = 'test-123';

-- Verify no remnants
SELECT 'decision_logs' as source, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM decision_sync_event_logs WHERE external_ref = 'chatwoot:test-123'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'facts', COUNT(*) 
FROM dashboard_facts WHERE value::jsonb->>'conversationId' = 'test-123'
UNION ALL

    'conversations', jsonb_agg(
      jsonb_build_object(
        'action', action,
        'timestamp', created_at,
        'operator', actor,
        'conversation_id', external_ref
