# Operator Privacy Notice Copy (Draft for Publication)

## Dashboard Usage Analytics
We collect limited operator telemetry (email, tile interactions, request IDs) to monitor uptime and improve the Operator Control Center. Analytics data is stored in Supabase for up to 180 days and is accessible only to authorized HotDash personnel. You can opt out at any time by toggling **Share usage analytics** off in Settings → Privacy or emailing privacy@hotdash.io.

## AI-Assisted Replies
When you request an AI suggestion, we send the relevant conversation context to our AI provider (Anthropic) after removing payment details, email addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive fields. Suggestions are optional—you decide whether to send, edit, or discard them. We retain AI interaction logs for up to 12 months to investigate misuse and satisfy audit requirements.

## Third-Party Processors
We use Shopify, Chatwoot, Supabase, Google Analytics, and Anthropic to deliver the Operator Control Center. Each processor operates under signed data protection agreements. Data may be transferred to the United States. Contact privacy@hotdash.io for the latest list of subprocessors or to request deletion.
