# Privacy Comms Sign-off Request Draft — 2025-10-12

Prepared outreach to marketing and support using the template at `docs/compliance/templates/privacy_comm_signoff_request.md`. Ready to send via email/Slack once final send window confirmed.

```
Subject: OCC privacy copy — request for launch confirmation (due 2025-10-13)

Hi <Marketing Lead>,

Thanks again for partnering on the privacy updates. Quick confirmation request so we can close the sprint item:

- Collateral: docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md (email/blog), docs/marketing/launch_faq.md
- Privacy callouts included: Shopify Admin scope, Supabase telemetry retention (180 days), Settings → Privacy controls.
- Planned send window: 2025-10-15 launch go/no-go (TBC).

Could you please reply "Confirmed" (or provide edits) so we can archive the acknowledgement in docs/compliance/evidence/operator_privacy_comms/ and log it in feedback/compliance.md?

Appreciate it!

Thanks,
Casey
```

Next Steps:
- Adapt the greeting and collateral list for the support lead, then deliver both messages through the appropriate channels.
- Archive responses in this directory upon receipt.
