Hi Google Cloud Support,

Checking in on our 2025-10-07 request for the GA MCP Data Processing Addendum and regional commitment letter (HotDash account). Could you share the ticket reference number and expected delivery date? We need the documents on file before enabling MCP in our production environment.

Thanks for the assist,
Casey
