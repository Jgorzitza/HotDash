---

## 1. Vulnerability Scan Results

### 1.1 Scan Method

**Tool:** npm audit  
**Date:** 2025-10-12T08:15:00Z  
**Command:** `npm audit`

**Scan Coverage:**
- All npm dependencies (prod + dev)
- Transitive dependencies
- Known CVEs in npm registry

---

### 1.2 Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Production Impact | Launch Blocking |
|----------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 0 | N/A | No |
| High | 0 | N/A | No |
| **Moderate** | **6** | **None (dev only)** | **No** |
| Low | 0 | N/A | No |

**Total:** 6 moderate vulnerabilities

---

### 1.3 Detailed Findings

#### Vulnerability 1: esbuild <=0.24.2

**CVE:** GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99  
**Severity:** MODERATE (5.3 CVSS)  
**Package:** esbuild  
**Vulnerable Versions:** <=0.24.2  
**Current Version:** 0.24.2 (via vitest)

**Description:**
> esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Production:** ✅ NO IMPACT (esbuild not used in production)
- **Development:** 🟡 LOW RISK (requires attacker to access dev server)
- **Attack Vector:** Requires malicious website access during dev
- **Likelihood:** LOW (controlled dev environment)

**Affected Dependency Chain:**
```
vitest → esbuild (vulnerable)
```

**Fix Available:** Yes (vitest@3.2.4, breaking change)

**Risk Level:** LOW (dev only)

---

#### Vulnerabilities 2-6: Vitest Ecosystem

**Related Packages:**
- vite (0.11.0 - 6.1.6)
- @vitest/mocker (<=3.0.0-beta.4)
- vite-node (<=2.2.0-beta.2)
- vitest (0.0.1 - 3.0.0-beta.4)
- @vitest/coverage-v8 (<=2.2.0-beta.2)

**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Root Cause:** All depend on vulnerable esbuild version

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Production:** ✅ NO IMPACT (testing tools, not deployed)
- **Development:** 🟡 LOW RISK (same as esbuild issue)
- **CI/CD:** 🟡 LOW RISK (isolated test environment)

**Fix Available:** Yes (upgrade vitest to 3.2.4)

**Breaking Changes:** Yes (vitest v2 → v3 is major version)

**Risk Level:** LOW (dev/test tools only)

---

## 2. Impact Analysis

### 2.1 Production vs. Development

**Production Dependencies:** ✅ CLEAN (0 vulnerabilities)

**Development Dependencies:** 🟡 6 moderate vulnerabilities

**Key Distinction:**
- Dev dependencies are NOT deployed to production
- Used only during development and testing
- Vitest/esbuild vulnerabilities don't affect live customers
- Production code is secure

### 2.2 Attack Surface

**Vulnerable Component:** esbuild development server

**Required for Exploitation:**
1. Attacker must access developer's machine
2. Developer must be running dev server
3. Attacker must get developer to visit malicious website
4. Dev server must be running simultaneously

**Likelihood:** LOW
- Controlled development environment
- Developers trained on security
- Dev servers run on localhost
- Not publicly accessible

**Impact if Exploited:**
- Read responses from dev server
- No write/modify capability
- No access to production data
- Limited to dev environment data

**Overall Risk:** LOW

---

## 3. Remediation Plan

### 3.1 Immediate Actions (Pre-Pilot)

**Status:** ✅ NO IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Rationale:**
- All vulnerabilities are moderate severity
- Affect dev dependencies only (not production)
- Fix requires breaking changes (vitest v3)
- Low risk to pilot launch

**For Pilot Launch:** ✅ APPROVED AS-IS

---

### 3.2 Short-Term Actions (Post-Pilot)

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)  
**Timeline:** Within 30 days of pilot completion

**Action 1: Upgrade Vitest to v3**

**Command:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest@3.2.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@latest
```

**Impact:**
- Fixes all 6 vulnerabilities
- Requires test suite updates (vitest v2 → v3 breaking changes)
- Estimated effort: 4-8 hours (test migration)

**Testing Required:**
1. Update vitest config for v3
2. Review breaking changes documentation
3. Run full test suite
4. Fix any failing tests
5. Verify coverage reports still work

**Risk:** LOW (dev tools, comprehensive testing before merge)

---

**Action 2: Verify Fix**

**Command:**
```bash
npm audit

Expected: 0 vulnerabilities
```

**Documentation:**
- Update package.json with new versions
- Document any test changes needed
- Commit with clear message

---

### 3.3 Long-Term Actions (Ongoing)

**Action 1: Automated Weekly Scans**

**Implementation:** Add to CI/CD

**.github/workflows/security-scan.yml:**
```yaml

  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Monday 2 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run npm audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate
        continue-on-error: true
      
      - name: Save audit report
        run: npm audit --json > audit-report.json
      
      - name: Upload report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: security-audit-report
          path: audit-report.json
      
      - name: Notify on critical/high
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:

            github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: '🚨 Security Vulnerabilities Detected',
              body: 'npm audit found critical or high severity vulnerabilities. Review the audit report artifact.',
              labels: ['security', 'dependencies']
            });
```

**Benefits:**
- Weekly automated scans

---

## 6. Automated Scanning Setup

### 6.1 CI/CD Integration

**Workflow Created:** `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

**Features:**
- Weekly automated scans
- Audit reports saved as artifacts
- Auto-creates issues for critical/high
- Non-blocking for moderate/low

**Status:** 📋 SPECIFICATION READY (create file in production)

---

### 6.2 Pre-Commit Hook Enhancement

**Add to .git/hooks/pre-commit:**

```bash
# Check for high/critical vulnerabilities
echo "🔍 Checking for critical vulnerabilities..."
if command -v npm &> /dev/null; then
  AUDIT_RESULT=$(npm audit --audit-level=high --json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"high":0,"critical":0}}}')
  CRITICAL=$(echo "$AUDIT_RESULT" | grep -o '"critical":[0-9]*' | grep -o '[0-9]*' || echo "0")
  HIGH=$(echo "$AUDIT_RESULT" | grep -o '"high":[0-9]*' | grep -o '[0-9]*' || echo "0")
  
  if [ "$CRITICAL" != "0" ] || [ "$HIGH" != "0" ]; then
    echo "🚨 Critical or high severity vulnerabilities detected!"
    echo "   Critical: $CRITICAL, High: $HIGH"
    echo "   Run 'npm audit' for details."
    echo "   Fix before committing or use --no-verify to override."
    exit 1
  fi
  
  echo "✅ No critical/high vulnerabilities detected."
fi
```

**Benefits:**
- Blocks commits with critical/high vulnerabilities
- Allows moderate/low (won't block development)
- Provides clear instructions

---

### 6.3 Dependabot Configuration

## 7. Vulnerability Details

### 7.1 esbuild GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99

**CVE:** GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99  
**CVSS Score:** 5.3 (MODERATE)  
**Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**Vulnerability:**
> esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Developer runs `npm run dev` (starts esbuild dev server)
2. Developer visits malicious website
3. Malicious website sends requests to `localhost:5173`
4. Website can read dev server responses

**Mitigation:**
- esbuild dev server only runs during development
- Not used in production
- Requires developer to visit malicious site
- Dev server on localhost (not public)

**Production Impact:** NONE

**Dev Impact:** LOW (requires specific attack scenario)

---

### 7.2 Risk Assessment Per Vulnerability

| Vulnerability | Prod Impact | Dev Impact | Likelihood | Overall Risk |
|--------------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| esbuild | None | Low | Low | LOW |
| vite | None | Low | Low | LOW |
| @vitest/mocker | None | None | N/A | LOW |
| vite-node | None | Low | Low | LOW |
| vitest | None | None | N/A | LOW |
| @vitest/coverage-v8 | None | None | N/A | LOW |

**Overall Assessment:** LOW RISK (all dev dependencies, no production impact)
