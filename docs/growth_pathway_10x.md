## Growth Goal

**Enable Hot Rod AN to grow from $1MM to $10MM annual revenue in 5-7 years**

**HotDash Role**: Unlock CEO time for revenue activities, provide growth insights

## Growth Levers

### Lever 1: CEO Time Reallocation (Immediate)

**Current**: CEO spends 62% of time on ops (25 hrs/week)  
**Target**: CEO spends 30% on ops (13 hrs/week)  
**Freed Time**: 12 hours/week → redirect to sales, marketing, partnerships

**Revenue Impact**: 12 hrs/week × $1,500/hr effective rate = $18K/week potential = $864K/year

---

### Lever 2: Inventory Optimization (Months 1-3)

**Problem**: Stockouts lose sales, overstock ties up cash  
**Solution**: Dashboard inventory alerts + demand forecasting

**Impact**:
- Reduce stockouts by 80% → +$50K/year sales capture
- Reduce overstock by 50% → free up $30K cash

---

### Lever 3: Customer Retention (Months 3-6)

**Problem**: Manual support is slow, customers churn  
**Solution**: AI approval queue = faster, better responses

**Impact**:
- CSAT improvement: 4.2 → 4.6
- Retention improvement: 75% → 82%
- LTV increase: +$150/customer × 1,000 customers = +$150K

---

### Lever 4: Operational Scalability (Year 1-2)

**Problem**: Can't scale operations without hiring  
**Solution**: Dashboard enables delegation to Ops Manager

**Impact**:
- Hire Ops Manager 12 months earlier ($1.5MM vs $2.5MM revenue)
- CEO focuses 100% on sales and growth
- Faster scaling: 30-50% growth vs 10-15%

---

**Revenue**: $1.7MM → $5.0MM (3x growth in 2 years)
