### Dashboard Overview

## Using the Knowledge Base

### 1. Searching for Answers

**To find an answer:**

1. Type your question in the search box
2. Use natural language (e.g., "How do I track my order?")
3. Filter by category if you know it (Orders, Shipping, etc.)
4. Review the results

**Search Tips:**

- Use customer's exact words when possible
- Try different phrasings if first search doesn't work
- Check multiple categories if unsure
- Look at confidence scores (higher = more reliable)

### 2. Understanding Article Information

Each article shows:

- **Question** — The customer question it answers
- **Answer** — The recommended response
- **Category** — Topic area (Orders, Shipping, Returns, etc.)
- **Tags** — Keywords for easier finding
- **Confidence** — How reliable the answer is (0-100%)
- **Usage** — How many times it's been used
- **Created** — When it was added

### 3. Using Articles in Responses

**When responding to customers:**

1. Search the KB for relevant articles
2. Read the suggested answer
3. Adapt the language to match the customer's tone
4. Add specific details (order numbers, dates, etc.)
5. Always verify the information is current

**Important:** Don't copy-paste blindly! Use KB articles as a guide, but personalize your response.
