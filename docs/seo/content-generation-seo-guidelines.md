## 1. Content Length Standards

### Why Length Matters

**Google's perspective**:

- <50 words = Thin content (penalty risk)
- 50-100 words = Minimal value
- 100-300 words = Good for specific topics
- 300+ words = Comprehensive, ranks well

**User perspective**:

- Too short = Feels incomplete, low trust
- Just right = Gets answer quickly
- Too long = TL;DR, high bounce rate

### Guidelines by Content Type

**Product Descriptions**:

- Minimum: 100 words
- Optimal: 150-250 words
- Maximum: 400 words

**Size Charts**:

- Minimum: 100 words
- Optimal: 150-200 words
- Include: Chart + how to measure + fit notes

**Installation Guides**:

- Minimum: 150 words
- Optimal: 250-400 words
- Include: Tools + steps + time + troubleshooting

**Warranty/Policy Content**:

- Minimum: 120 words
- Optimal: 180-250 words
- Include: Coverage + exclusions + claim process

**General Rule**: If explaining something important, aim for 200+ words with examples.

---

## 2. Readability Optimization

### Flesch Reading Ease Score

**Formula**: `206.835 - 1.015(words/sentences) - 84.6(syllables/words)`

**Target**: 60-80 (8th-9th grade level)

**Why 8th-9th grade?**:

- Average US adult reads at 8th grade level
- Ecommerce content should be accessible to all
- Technical products (skateboards) need simple explanations

### How to Improve Readability

**Shorter sentences**:

- ❌ Bad: "Our skateboards feature premium Canadian maple construction with advanced concave profiles designed specifically for street skating performance and enhanced durability under extreme conditions." (24 words)
- ✅ Good: "Our decks use premium Canadian maple. The concave design helps with flip tricks. Built to handle street skating abuse." (3 sentences, 8 words avg)

**Simpler words**:

- ❌ utilize → ✅ use
- ❌ facilitate → ✅ help
- ❌ optimal → ✅ best
- ❌ subsequently → ✅ then

**Break up paragraphs**:

- Maximum 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- Use bullet points for lists
- Add white space for scanning

**Check before publishing**:

```typescript
import { analyzeContent } from "~/services/seo/content-optimizer";

const analysis = await analyzeContent(url, html, targetKeyword);
if (analysis.readability.fleschScore < 60) {
  console.warn("Too hard to read. Simplify sentences.");
}
```

---

## 3. Keyword Optimization

### Keyword Density Rules

**Target Range**: 1-3% total

**Breakdown**:

- Primary keyword: 1-2% (e.g., "size chart" appears 2x in 100 words)
- Secondary keywords: 0.5-1% each
- Total: 2-3% combined

**Why 1-3%?**:

- <1% = Underoptimized, won't rank
- 1-3% = Optimal, natural language
- > 3% = Keyword stuffing, Google penalty

### Keyword Placement Strategy

**Priority locations** (in order):

1. **H2 heading** (most important for SEO)
2. **First paragraph** (first 100 characters)
3. **H3 subheadings** (2-3 times)
4. **Image alt text** (if relevant)
5. **Internal link anchor text** (1-2 times)

**Example** (size chart template):

```markdown
<h2>Skateboard Deck Size Guide</h2> ← Primary: "size guide" (synonym)

Find the perfect deck width for your skating style. Our sizing chart helps you choose based on height and shoe size. ← First paragraph, primary keyword

<h3>How to Use This Size Chart</h3> ← H3, keyword variation

<h3>Sizing Tips by Style</h3> ← H3, related keywords
```

**Keyword density**: "size" appears 4x, "chart/guide" 3x in ~150 words = ~2.3% ✅

### Keyword Variations (Use Synonyms)

**Don't repeat the same keyword**:

- ❌ "size chart, size chart, size chart" (boring, spammy)
- ✅ "size guide", "sizing chart", "measurement table", "fit guide"

**Skateboard-specific keywords**:

- Primary: skateboard, deck, board
- Variations: complete, setup, cruiser, longboard
- Technical: concave, wheelbase, nose, tail
- Usage: street skating, park skating, tricks

### Long-Tail Keywords (High Value)

**Why**: Less competition, higher intent, better conversion

**Examples**:

- "how to install skateboard trucks" (vs "trucks")
- "skateboard deck size for beginners" (vs "deck size")
- "52mm vs 54mm skateboard wheels" (vs "wheels")

**Implementation**: Include full questions/phrases in H3 headings

```markdown
<h3>How to Choose Skateboard Wheel Size</h3>

For street skating, 50-53mm wheels are ideal...
```

---

## 4. Heading Structure Best Practices

### Hierarchy Rules

```markdown
<h2>Main Topic</h2>
  <h3>Subtopic 1</h3>
    Content...
  <h3>Subtopic 2</h3>
    Content...
```

**Rules**:

- Never skip levels (H2 → H4 ❌)
- Only one H1 per page (usually product title - managed by Shopify theme)
- Start content sections with H2
- Use H3 for subsections
- H4 rarely needed

### Keyword in Headings

**Best practice**: Include primary or secondary keywords in 50-70% of headings

**Example** (Installation Guide):

- H2: "How to Install Skateboard Trucks" ✅ (primary keyword)
- H3: "Tools You'll Need" ✅ (related keyword)
- H3: "Step-by-Step Mounting Instructions" ✅ (secondary keyword)
- H3: "Common Installation Problems" ✅ (long-tail keyword)

**Avoid**:

- H2: "Getting Started" ❌ (generic, no keywords)
- H3: "Part 1" ❌ (not descriptive)

---

## 5. Internal Linking Strategy

### Link Density Target

**Optimal**: 2-5 internal links per 100 words

**Calculation**:

- 150-word content = 3-7 links
- 250-word content = 5-12 links
- 100-word content = 2-5 links

### Link Types & Purposes

**Product Links** (Cross-sell):

```markdown
Trucks sold separately. [Shop trucks →](/collections/trucks)
Recommended pairing: [ABEC-7 bearings](/products/bearings-abec-7)
```

**Educational Links** (Reduce bounce rate):

```markdown
New to skating? Read our [beginner's guide →](/pages/skateboard-basics)
[Watch installation video →](/pages/how-to-install-trucks)
```

**Category Links** (SEO juice):

```markdown
Browse all [skateboard decks](/collections/decks)
See our complete [wheel selection](/collections/wheels)
```

**Support Links** (Build trust):

```markdown
Questions? [Contact our team →](/pages/contact)
Read our [complete warranty policy →](/pages/warranty)
```

### Anchor Text Best Practices

**Descriptive anchors** (Good for SEO):

- ✅ "skateboard bearings"
- ✅ "deck sizing guide"
- ✅ "installation video tutorial"

**Generic anchors** (Weak for SEO):

- ❌ "click here"
- ❌ "read more"
- ❌ "this page"

**Example**:

```markdown
❌ For more information, click [here](/pages/sizing).
✅ Learn more in our [complete deck sizing guide →](/pages/sizing).
```

---

## 6. Image & Alt Text Optimization

### When to Include Images

**Required**:

- Size charts (visual diagram mandatory)
- Installation guides (step photos mandatory)
- Product dimensions (helpful but not mandatory)

**Not required**:

- Warranty information
- Text-only policies

### Alt Text Formula

**Pattern**: `{Product name} {what it shows} {relevant keyword}`

**Length**: 10-125 characters (optimal: 50-80)

**Examples**:

- ✅ "Skateboard deck size chart showing width and length measurements"
- ✅ "Step 2 of truck installation showing baseplate alignment"
- ✅ "Skateboard wheel dimensions diagram with 52mm diameter"
- ❌ "Image 1" (not descriptive)
- ❌ "Size chart" (missing product context)

### Image SEO Checklist

- [ ] Descriptive filename: `deck-size-chart.jpg` (not `IMG_1234.jpg`)
- [ ] Alt text 50-80 characters
- [ ] Includes product name
- [ ] Includes relevant keyword if natural
- [ ] File size optimized (<200KB)
- [ ] Modern format (WebP preferred, JPEG/PNG acceptable)

## 7. Content Templates - SEO-Optimized Versions

### Template: Size Chart

```markdown
<h2>Skateboard Deck Size Guide</h2>

Find your perfect deck size with our sizing chart. Deck width affects stability, flip speed, and overall feel.

| Deck Width | Rider Height | Shoe Size | Best For                    |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------- | --------------------------- |
| 7.5"-7.75" | 4'5"-5'2"    | 6-8       | Street, technical tricks    |
| 8.0"-8.25" | 5'3"-5'6"    | 9-10      | Street, park, all-around    |
| 8.5"-8.75" | 5'7"-6'0"    | 11-12     | Park, vert, cruising        |
| 9.0"+      | 6'0"+        | 13+       | Transition, bowl, stability |

**How to Measure**: Stand on the deck. Your toes should reach both edges without overhang. Too wide feels sluggish for tricks. Too narrow feels unstable.

**Between sizes?**

- Go narrower for flip tricks and street skating
- Go wider for bowls, ramps, and stability
- Most riders prefer 8.0"-8.25" for versatility

**Still unsure?** Check our [complete deck buying guide →](/pages/how-to-choose-skateboard-deck) or [contact us for recommendations →](/pages/contact).

<img src="/deck-size-chart.jpg" alt="Skateboard deck size chart comparing widths from 7.5 to 9 inches">

**Word Count**: 156 words ✅  
**Flesch Score**: ~72 ✅  
**Keyword Density**: 2.1% ✅  
**Internal Links**: 2 ✅  
**SEO Score**: 82/100 (B) ✅
```

### Template: Product Dimensions

```markdown
<h2>Wheel Specifications & Measurements</h2>

These street wheels are sized for optimal performance on ledges, gaps, and park obstacles.

**Wheel Specs**:

- Diameter: 52mm (perfect for street and park)
- Width: 32mm contact patch
- Durometer: 99A (hard, fast roll, smooth slides)
- Core: Standard (fits all bearings)
- Weight: 48g per wheel, 192g for set of 4

**Why These Specs Matter**:

52mm diameter provides quick acceleration without sacrificing top speed. The 99A hardness is ideal for smooth concrete - hard enough for speed but soft enough for grip. 32mm width gives you the right balance of stability and flip response.

**Recommended For**:

- Rider weight: 120-180 lbs
- Surfaces: Smooth concrete, skateparks
- Style: Street, park, technical skating

**What's Included**: Set of 4 wheels. [Mounted bearings →](/products/bearings-abec-7) sold separately.

**Compare sizes**: [50mm wheels →](/collections/wheels?filter=50mm) (slower, more control) | [54mm wheels →](/collections/wheels?filter=54mm) (faster, less pop)

**Word Count**: 142 words ✅  
**Flesch Score**: ~68 ✅  
**Keyword Density**: 2.8% ✅  
**Internal Links**: 3 ✅  
**SEO Score**: 79/100 (C+) ✅
```

### Template: Installation Guide

```markdown
<h2>How to Install Skateboard Trucks - Complete Guide</h2>

Mount your trucks properly for safe skating. This 10-minute installation guide covers everything you need.

<h3>Tools You'll Need</h3>

- Phillips screwdriver or [skate tool →](/products/skate-tool)
- 8 mounting bolts (included with trucks)
- Optional: 1/8" riser pads (prevents wheel bite)

<h3>Installation Steps</h3>

**Step 1: Orient Your Deck**  
Flip deck grip-side down. The nose (front) is slightly longer than tail. You'll see 8 pre-drilled holes.

**Step 2: Insert Bolts from Top**  
Push bolts through grip tape side down through holes. Use 1" bolts standard, 1-1/8" if adding risers.

**Step 3: Position Trucks**  
Align truck baseplates under deck with bolts coming through. Kingpin (large bolt) should face inward.

**Step 4: Hand-Tighten Nuts**  
Thread all 8 nuts by hand until snug. Don't fully tighten yet.

**Step 5: Final Tightening**  
Using skate tool, tighten in star pattern (not in sequence). This prevents deck warping. Tighten until you can't turn easily by hand.

**Step 6: Test It**  
Stand on board, rock side-to-side. No movement = properly mounted. Loose = tighten more.

**Installation Time**:

- First time: 10-15 minutes
- Experienced: 5 minutes

<h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>

- **Bolts too short?** Need 1-1/8" bolts when using riser pads
- **Wheel bite?** Add 1/8" [riser pads →](/products/riser-pads) for clearance
- **Stripped bolt?** Replace immediately, don't over-tighten

**Video Tutorial**: [Watch our 3-minute installation video →](/pages/truck-installation-video)

**Next Steps**: [Adjust truck tightness →](/pages/truck-setup) | [Install wheels & bearings →](/pages/wheel-installation)

**Word Count**: 261 words ✅

**Internal Links**: 6 ✅  
**SEO Score**: 86/100 (B) ✅

## 8. Automated Quality Control

### Integration with content-optimizer.ts

**Before Publishing**:

```typescript
import { analyzeContent } from "~/services/seo/content-optimizer";

async function validateContent(
  content: string,
  targetKeyword: string,
): Promise<boolean> {
  const url = "https://hotrodan.com/mock"; // Mock URL for analysis
  const analysis = await analyzeContent(url, content, targetKeyword);

  // Check against standards
  const passChecks = {
    readability: analysis.readability.fleschScore >= 60,
    keywords: analysis.keywords.isOptimal,
    headings: analysis.headings.hasProperStructure,
    score: analysis.overallScore.score >= 75,
  };

  // Log issues
  if (!passChecks.readability) {
    console.warn("❌ Readability too low:", analysis.readability.fleschScore);
  }
  if (!passChecks.keywords) {
    console.warn("❌ Keyword density off:", analysis.keywords.density + "%");
  }
  if (!passChecks.headings) {
    console.warn("❌ Heading structure invalid");
  }
  if (!passChecks.score) {
    console.warn("❌ SEO score too low:", analysis.overallScore.score);
    console.warn("Recommendations:", analysis.recommendations);
  }

  // Pass only if all checks pass
  return Object.values(passChecks).every((check) => check);
}

// Usage
const isValid = await validateContent(generatedContent, "size chart");
if (!isValid) {
  throw new Error("Content failed SEO quality check");
}
```

### Auto-Improvement (Future Enhancement)

```typescript
async function autoOptimizeContent(
  content: string,
  targetKeyword: string,
): Promise<string> {
  const analysis = await analyzeContent("mock", content, targetKeyword);
  let optimized = content;

  // Auto-fix heading structure
  if (!analysis.headings.hasProperStructure) {
    // Convert **Title** to <h2>Title</h2>
    optimized = optimized.replace(/\*\*([^*]+)\*\*:/g, "<h2>$1</h2>");
  }

  // Auto-add internal links
  if (analysis.links.internalLinks < 2) {
    // Append suggested links based on content type
    optimized += "\n\n[Related products →](/collections/all)";
  }

  return optimized;
}
```

## 9. Brand Voice + SEO = Perfect Balance

### Hot Rod AN Voice Guidelines

**Tone**: Knowledgeable but approachable, skateboarding insider

**Do's**:

- ✅ Use skateboarding terminology naturally ("pop", "flip tricks", "street skating")
- ✅ Address skaters directly ("your deck", "you'll need")
- ✅ Be confident ("This is the best size for...", not "might be okay")
- ✅ Share insider tips ("Pro tip:", "Since 2020 we've learned...")

**Don'ts**:

- ❌ Corporate jargon ("utilize", "facilitate", "leverage")
- ❌ Over-technical without explanation
- ❌ Passive voice ("it should be noted that...")
- ❌ Keyword stuffing that sounds robotic

### Balancing SEO & Voice

**Bad** (keyword stuffed, no voice):

> Our skateboard deck size chart shows skateboard deck sizing for all skateboard riders. Use our skateboard size chart to find skateboard deck width.

**Good** (natural keywords, strong voice):

> Find your perfect deck width with our sizing guide. Whether you skate street or park, the right width makes all the difference.

## 10. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Placeholder Content

**Problem**: [FILL IN], [STEP 1], [TIME] left in published content  
**Impact**: Zero SEO value, looks unprofessional  
**Fix**: Never publish with placeholders

### ❌ Mistake #2: Too Short

**Problem**: 30-50 word snippets  
**Impact**: Google sees as "thin content", won't rank  
**Fix**: Minimum 100 words, optimal 150+

### ❌ Mistake #3: Keyword Stuffing

**Problem**: "size chart" appears 8 times in 80 words (10% density)  
**Impact**: Google penalty, sounds spammy  
**Fix**: Use synonyms, keep density 1-3%

### ❌ Mistake #4: No Headings

**Problem**: Using **bold** instead of `<h2>` tags  
**Impact**: Google can't understand structure  
**Fix**: Always use semantic HTML headings

### ❌ Mistake #5: No Links

**Problem**: Content stands alone with zero internal links  
**Impact**: High bounce rate, lost SEO juice  
**Fix**: Add 2-5 contextual internal links

### ❌ Mistake #6: Generic Content

**Problem**: Could apply to any skate shop  
**Impact**: Won't rank for specific product searches  
**Fix**: Include product-specific details, Hot Rod AN personality
