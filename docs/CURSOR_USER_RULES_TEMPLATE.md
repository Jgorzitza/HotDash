- Document decisions with reasoning (ADRs)
- Consider maintenance burden in design choices
```

### For Security-Focused Users:

```markdown
# Security-First Approach

```markdown
# Performance Priority

- Prefer streaming over loading all at once
- Cache aggressively but invalidate correctly
- Monitor production metrics continuously
```

### For Accessibility Champions:

```markdown
# Accessibility First

## ðŸŽ¨ Hot Rod AN / CEO-Specific Preferences (Example)

```markdown
# Hot Rod AN Operator Mindset

- Professional but approachable

## Business Context
- Always consider ROI and operator efficiency
- Prioritize features that save operator time
- Think "what would a car shop operator need?"
- Balance automation with human oversight

## Decision-Making
- "AI suggests, you approve" principle
- No fully automated actions without human approval
- Transparency in AI recommendations
- Clear undo/rollback capabilities

## Evidence-First Culture

- Real data over assumptions
```

## ðŸ”„ How User Rules and Project Rules Work Together

### Hierarchy:

1. **Project Rules** (`.cursorrules` in repo)
   - Applies to: Everyone on the project
   - Contains: Project-specific standards, tools, processes
   - Committed to: Git (shared)

2. **User Rules** (in Cursor settings)
   - Applies to: Just you, across all projects
   - Contains: Personal preferences, style, workflows
   - Committed to: Nothing (personal)

### When They Conflict:

- **Project rules take precedence** for project-specific requirements
- **User rules apply** for personal style preferences
- Example: Project requires MCP tools (enforced), you prefer detailed comments (your choice)

## ðŸ“Š Recommended User Rules for HotDash Team

### For All Team Members:

```markdown
# HotDash Team Standards

## MCP Awareness
- Always check if MCP tool exists before using CLI
- Verify React Router 7 patterns with Context7 MCP
- Validate Shopify queries with Shopify MCP
- When in doubt, grep the codebase first

## Evidence Culture
- Include evidence paths in all work logs
- Screenshot critical flows
- Log metrics before/after changes
- Document decisions with reasoning

## Security Paranoia
- Treat all secrets as highly sensitive
- Redact before logging
- Reference vault paths, never hardcode
- Zero tolerance for committed secrets
```
