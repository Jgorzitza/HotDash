### Referral Process

```
"We're looking to help 3-5 more hot rod shops like yours. Who else in the hot rod community might benefit from HotDash?"
```

**Step 2: Make It Easy**
- Provide email template CEO can forward
- Or: Personal introduction via email/phone
- Or: Referral link (auto-credits referrer account)

**Step 3: Follow Up**

- Mention referrer: "Hot Rodan's CEO thought you'd benefit"
- Offer pilot pricing ($200-$300/month)

**Step 4: Credit Referrer**

## Viral Coefficient Target

**Formula**: Viral Coefficient = (% of customers who refer) × (avg referrals per customer) × (% referrals who convert)

**Example**:
- 60% of customers refer at least 1 peer
- Average 1.5 referrals per referring customer
- 40% of referrals convert to pilot

**Viral Coefficient**: 0.6 × 1.5 × 0.4 = **0.36**

**Goal by Month 6**: Viral coefficient >0.5 (sustainable WoM growth)  
**Stretch Goal**: Viral coefficient >1.0 (exponential growth)
