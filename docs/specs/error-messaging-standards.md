# Error Messaging Standards

**File:** `docs/specs/error-messaging-standards.md`  
**Owner:** Content Agent  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Purpose:** Standardized error messages with clear recovery steps

---

## Purpose

Comprehensive error messaging framework for HotDash. Defines 3 severity levels (Critical, Warning, Info) with clear, actionable messages and recovery steps. Ensures consistent error communication across the application.

---

## Error Message Principles

### Core Requirements

1. **Clarity Over Jargon**: Plain language, no technical codes
2. **Actionable Guidance**: Tell users what to do next
3. **Appropriate Urgency**: Match severity to actual risk
4. **No Blame**: Never blame the user
5. **Recovery Focus**: How to fix, not just what's wrong

### Voice Guidelines

- ‚úÖ **Professional**: Serious tone for errors
- ‚úÖ **Helpful**: Provide solutions, not just problems
- ‚úÖ **Honest**: Don't hide or minimize issues
- ‚úÖ **Clear**: Simple sentences, no ambiguity
- ‚ùå **No Hot Rodan Theme**: Errors need clarity, not creativity
- ‚ùå **No Humor**: Frustrated users don't want jokes

---

## Severity Levels

### 1. Critical (Red)

**Definition:** Blocks core functionality, immediate action required, data loss risk

**Visual Treatment:**

- Color: Red (#CC0000)
- Icon: ‚ö† or üö®
- Banner: Full-width persistent
- Sound: Alert tone (if enabled)

**Use For:**

- Data loss or corruption
- Security breaches
- Integration failures (Shopify disconnect)
- Payment processing errors
- Critical system outages

**Don't Use For:**

- Validation errors (use Warning)
- Network timeouts (use Warning)
- Missing optional data (use Info)

### 2. Warning (Yellow)

**Definition:** Impacts functionality but not blocking, attention needed soon, workarounds available

**Visual Treatment:**

- Color: Orange/Yellow (#FFA500)
- Icon: ‚ö†
- Banner: Top of section
- Toast: Optional
- Sound: Optional notification

**Use For:**

- Integration degraded (partial data)
- API rate limits approaching
- Validation errors
- Configuration issues
- Non-critical failures

**Don't Use For:**

- Total failures (use Critical)
- Informational messages (use Info)
- Success states (use Success toast)

### 3. Info (Blue)

**Definition:** Informational message, no action required or low priority, helpful context

**Visual Treatment:**

- Color: Blue (#0066CC)
- Icon: ‚Ñπ
- Banner: Subtle, dismissible
- Toast: Brief display
- Sound: None

**Use For:**

- Feature unavailable (not connected)
- Data limitations (historical not available)
- Suggestions and tips
- Status updates
- New feature announcements

**Don't Use For:**

- Errors requiring action (use Warning/Critical)
- Success messages (use Success toast)
