Title: AN‑Vision (Photo‑to‑Fitment)

What

- Web tool to snap a photo of hose end/fitting next to calibration card; estimate AN size/thread; propose adapters and kits.

Why

- Reduce returns and back-and-forth; brand moat with a "fitting scanner".

Build

- Client‑side inference (classical + lightweight ML) with checklist; server verifies and routes to chat for HITL when confidence low.

KPI

- Return rate ↓, time‑to‑answer ↓, attach rate ↑ on vision‑assisted sessions.
