### AI Team
**Last Update**: 2025-10-14T13:30:00Z  
**Status**: 🚨 **BLOCKED - Waiting for specifications**  
**Current Task**: Cannot start - missing detailed specs

**Progress Since 13:15Z**:
- ❌ No updates (still showing 13:30Z timestamp)
- ✅ Tasks 4-5 complete (evaluation dataset, health monitoring)
- 🚨 **BLOCKED**: Requesting detailed specs for Priority 1 tasks

**AI Agent's Request** (from feedback):
> "Request to Manager: Please provide detailed specifications for Priority 1 tasks in direction file or separate task document."

**Product Response**: **SPECIFICATIONS ALREADY EXIST!**

Product agent delivered 5 complete specification documents at 13:00Z:
1. ✅ `docs/specs/action-schema-specification.md` (24KB)
2. ✅ `docs/specs/recommender-requirements.md` (21KB) — **CONTAINS ALL AI NEEDS**
3. ✅ `docs/specs/growth-spec-roadmap.md` (20KB)
4. ✅ `docs/specs/acceptance-criteria-all-items.md` (19KB)
5. ✅ `docs/specs/operator-workflows.md` (38KB)

**Critical File**: `docs/specs/recommender-requirements.md` contains:
- SEO CTR Optimizer (complete input/output schemas)
- Metaobject Generator (content generation specs)
- Merch Playbook (sort optimization)
- Guided Selling (cross-sell logic)
- Core Web Vitals (performance detection)
- Learning loop integration

**Action Required**: Manager must notify AI agent to read `docs/specs/recommender-requirements.md` and proceed with implementation.

## 🚧 Critical Blockers

### Blocker 1: A4 (Execution Engine) — Engineer
**Status**: In progress (resumed 21:30Z)  
**Impact**: Blocks 30+ downstream items  
**Owner**: Engineer  
**Timeline**: Unknown (just restarted work)  
**Dependencies**: Must complete before AI can test recommenders

### Blocker 2: AI-Product Communication Gap
**Status**: 🚨 **NEW BLOCKER IDENTIFIED**  
**Impact**: AI agent idle for 2+ hours waiting for specs that exist  
**Owner**: Manager (coordination)  
**Timeline**: Can resolve in <5 minutes with direction update  
**Resolution**: Point AI agent to `docs/specs/recommender-requirements.md`

### Blocker 3: Data Pipelines (B4-B7) — Data Agent
**Status**: Not started (agent ready 21:29Z)  
**Impact**: Recommenders will have incomplete data  
**Owner**: Data agent  
**Timeline**: 10-13 hours for P0 tasks  
**Dependencies**: Chatwoot ETL critical for AI training

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 2 Hours)
1. ⚠️ **Manager**: Update AI agent direction to read `docs/specs/recommender-requirements.md`
2. ⚠️ **Engineer**: Focus on A4 (Execution Engine) - highest priority blocker
3. ⚠️ **Data**: Start Chatwoot ETL (needed for AI training)

### Short-term (Today)
1. Engineer completes A4 implementation
2. AI begins SEO CTR Recommender (C1)
