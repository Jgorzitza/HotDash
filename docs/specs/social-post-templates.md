## DON'TS ❌

### Content
- ❌ **Overuse brand terms** - Not every post needs "Hot Rodan" 5 times
- ❌ **Force automotive metaphors** - If it doesn't fit naturally, skip it

- ❌ **Spam followers** - More than 2 posts/day risks unfollows
- ❌ **Ignore analytics** - Review what works, adjust strategy

- ❌ **Delete negative feedback** - Address it professionally
- ❌ **Ignore mentions** - Monitor and respond to tags
