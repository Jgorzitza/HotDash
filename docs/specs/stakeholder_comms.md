- Prevents QA final approval workflow

**Owner**: Manager Agent (requires CEO decision on resolution strategy)

**Escalated**: 2025-10-20T01:05:00Z

**Resolution Required**: CEO decision on Option A/B/C (see Priority 1 above)

**Risk Level**: üî¥ CRITICAL ‚Äî Timeline blocked until resolved

---

#### BLOCKER #2: QA Final Approval (P0 - REQUIRED) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: Cannot deploy without QA GO (previous NO-GO had 4 P0 blockers)

**Impact**:

- Launch gate ‚Äî no production deployment without QA approval
- Need final retest after all PRs merged

**Owner**: QA Agent

**Dependencies**:

- PR #98 resolved ‚úÖ
- 10 agent PRs merged ‚è≥ (blocked by #1)
- Production app stable ‚úÖ

**Timeline**: 4-6 hours after dependencies met

**Risk Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH ‚Äî Required for launch

---

#### BLOCKER #3: Designer Visual Review (P1 - REQUIRED) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: Visual defects may impact user experience

**Impact**:

- Quality gate ‚Äî visual issues may delay launch
- 15 molecules to execute (visual review + fixes)

**Owner**: Designer Agent

**Dependencies**:

- Production app accessible ‚úÖ (unblocked 2025-10-20)

**Timeline**: 3-4 hours execution

**Risk Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM ‚Äî Quality gate, not blocker

---

#### BLOCKER #4: Pilot Smoke Tests (P1 - REQUIRED) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: Workflow validation incomplete

**Impact**:

- May discover end-to-end user workflow issues
- 11 remaining molecules (27% ‚Üí 100%)

**Owner**: Pilot Agent

**Dependencies**:

- Production app accessible ‚úÖ (unblocked 2025-10-20)

**Timeline**: 2-3 hours remaining

**Risk Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM ‚Äî Validation gate

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline to Launch

**Best Case** (Option A chosen, no new blockers):

- **Today**: PR #98 resolved (2 hours), 10 PRs created (3 hours)
- **Tomorrow**: Designer + Pilot + QA execution (8 hours)
- **Day 3**: QA GO, final deployment (4 hours)
- **Total**: 48-72 hours to production launch

**Realistic Case** (Option B chosen, minor issues found):

- **Today**: PR #98 manual resolution (4 hours), PRs created (3 hours)
- **Tomorrow-Day 3**: Agent execution + fixes (12-16 hours)
- **Day 4**: QA GO, deployment (4 hours)
- **Total**: 72-96 hours to production launch

**Worst Case** (New P0 blockers discovered):

- **Week 1**: Blocker resolution + hotfixes (3-5 days)
- **Week 2**: Re-execution + final QA (2-3 days)
- **Total**: 7-14 days to production launch
