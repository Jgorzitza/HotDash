## 🚧 Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: A4 (Execution Engine) Blocking Critical Path
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Blocks 30+ downstream items (all recommenders)  
**Probability**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: In progress (Engineer working on it)  
**Mitigation**:
- Engineer focused exclusively on A4
- QA tests provide clear acceptance criteria
- Daily progress tracking to catch delays early
- Fallback: MVP without some recommenders if needed

**Timeline Impact**: If A4 delays 2+ days, full scope at risk.

---

### Risk 2: Behind Week 1 Target
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Impact**: 8/14 complete vs 14/14 target (57% vs 100%)  
**Probability**: HIGH (already behind)  
**Status**: Active risk  
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on completing P0 items first
- Data team ready to execute B4-B7 in parallel
- Consider overtime if needed EOW
- Adjust Week 2 scope if Week 1 bleeds over

**Timeline Impact**: May compress Week 2 timeline.

---

### Risk 3: Team Coordination Overhead
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Impact**: 2+ hour delay due to AI-Product coordination gap  
**Probability**: MEDIUM (happened once already)  
**Status**: Mitigated  
**Mitigation**:
- Daily progress tracking catches gaps early
- Product agent monitors all team feedback files
- Manager receives daily updates
- Clear handoff procedures documented

**Timeline Impact**: Minimal if daily tracking continues.

---

### Risk 4: Data Quality for Recommenders
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Recommenders may have incomplete training data  
**Probability**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: Planned mitigation  
**Mitigation**:
- Chatwoot ETL scheduled (P0 critical)
- Data validation pipeline (B6)
- Can launch with partial data, improve over time
- Historical data import scheduled

**Timeline Impact**: Quality over speed - better to delay than launch bad data.

## 🚀 Next Week Preview (Week 2)

**Focus**: Recommender implementation (C1-C5) + Learning loop (F1-F3)

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ A4 (Execution Engine) must complete

- ✅ AI agent unblocked and ready

**Planned Deliverables**:
1. SEO CTR Optimizer (C1)
2. Metaobject Generator (C2)
3. Merch Playbook (C3)
4. Guided Selling (C4)
5. Core Web Vitals (C5)
6. Learning loop foundation (F1-F3)

**Estimated Effort**: 26-33 hours

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. ⚠️ **Engineer**: Prioritize A4 completion above all else
2. ⚠️ **Data**: Execute Chatwoot ETL and B4-B7 in parallel
3. ⚠️ **Product**: Continue daily progress tracking to catch delays
4. ⚠️ **Manager**: Monitor A4 progress daily, escalate if blocked >24h

### Strategic Decisions Needed
1. **Scope Adjustment**: If Week 1 bleeds into Week 2, which recommenders can we deprioritize?
   - Recommendation: C1 (SEO CTR) is highest ROI, must ship. C4-C5 can slide.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Should we add engineering resources to unblock A4?
   - Recommendation: Monitor until Wed; if still blocked, consider pairing.

3. **MVP Definition**: What's minimum viable for Week 3 launch?
   - Recommendation: Action system + 1-2 recommenders + manual approval queue.
