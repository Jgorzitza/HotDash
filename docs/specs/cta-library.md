**File:** `docs/specs/cta-library.md`  
**Owner:** Content Agent  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Purpose:** Library of call-to-action phrases with A/B testing recommendations

---

## Purpose

Comprehensive library of conversion-optimized CTAs (Call-to-Actions) organized by category with A/B testing recommendations and data-driven best practices. All CTAs follow Hot Rodan brand voice and operator-first language principles.

---

## CTA Writing Principles

### Core Rules
1. **Action-Oriented**: Start with verb (Shop, Get, Start, Discover)
2. **Specific**: Describe what happens ("Download Guide" not "Click Here")
3. **Value-Focused**: Emphasize benefit or outcome
4. **Urgent (When Appropriate)**: Time/quantity limits drive action
5. **Clear Expectations**: User knows exactly what will happen

### Voice Guidelines
- ✅ **Active Voice**: "Get Your Free Guide" not "Free Guide Available"
- ✅ **Second Person**: "Start Your" not "Start My"  
- ✅ **Benefit-Forward**: Lead with value, not features
- ✅ **Concise**: 2-5 words ideal, max 8 words
- ❌ **Generic**: "Click Here", "Learn More", "Submit"
- ❌ **Passive**: "Guide Can Be Downloaded"
- ❌ **Jargon**: "Initialize Workflow", "Leverage Assets"

### Analysis Questions

**For Each CTA:**
1. What's the click-through rate?
2. How does it compare to benchmark?
3. Which variant performs best?
4. Does performance vary by device?
5. Does placement affect performance?

**Optimization:**
```
If CTR < benchmark:
• Test more specific language
• Add urgency or benefit
• Increase contrast/size
• Improve placement

If CTR > benchmark but low conversion:
• Check landing page match
• Verify value proposition
• Remove friction points
• Test different landing page
```

**✅ DO Use:**
- Homepage hero ("Rev Up Your Operations")

```
Rev Up Your Garage
Get Race-Ready Tools
Tune Your Ride
```

**Product:**
```
Add to Garage
Get Pro Performance
Build Your Dream Ride
```

**Sale:**
```
Pit Stop Pricing — Save 30%
Full Throttle Savings
Rev Up for Less
```

**Success:**
```
Order Placed — Full Speed Ahead!
Added to Garage ✓
You're All Tuned Up!
```
