# Growth Engine Inventory Optimization (INVENTORY-104)

## Overview

Advanced inventory optimization system for Growth Engine phases 9-12, providing comprehensive inventory management with AI-driven insights, emergency sourcing logic, and performance optimizations.

## Features

### 1. Advanced ROP Calculations

**Seasonal Adjustments**
- Dynamic seasonal factors based on historical data
- Month-specific demand patterns (e.g., 1.3x in October, 1.4x in November)
- Confidence scoring based on data quality and volatility

**Optimization Parameters**
- Demand volatility analysis
- Vendor lead time optimization
- Safety stock calculations with Z-score adjustments
- Service level targeting (default 95%)

### 2. Emergency Sourcing Logic

**Opportunity-Cost Analysis**
- Expected Lost Profit = daily_velocity × unit_margin × lead_time
- Incremental Cost = (emergency_cost - primary_cost) × quantity
- Net Benefit = Expected Lost Profit - Incremental Cost

**Decision Criteria**
- Fast delivery (≤7 days) prioritized
- Positive net benefit required
- Minimum margin floor (20% default, CEO override available)

### 3. Virtual Bundle Stock Management

**Component Bottleneck Analysis**
- Identifies limiting components across bundle variants
- Calculates maximum possible bundle assemblies
- Provides component order recommendations

**Stock Optimization**
- Real-time virtual stock calculations
- Component availability tracking
- Automated reorder suggestions

### 4. Vendor Performance Analysis

**Reliability Scoring**
- On-time delivery rate (40% weight)
- Quality score (30% weight)  
- Cost competitiveness (30% weight)

**Performance Metrics**
- Average lead time tracking
- Delivery consistency analysis
- Cost optimization opportunities

**Recommendations**
- Lead time improvements
- Reliability enhancements
- Cost optimization strategies

### 5. Performance Metrics

**Optimization Score**
- Overall system performance (0-1 scale)
- Based on stockout risk, turnover, cost efficiency

**Cost Savings**
- Quantified savings from optimizations
- Emergency sourcing cost avoidance
- Inventory turnover improvements
