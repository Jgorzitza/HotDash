### Scenario 2: Payment Failure
**Detection**: Payment declined, customer may not know
**Action**: Generate "Payment issue" notification draft
**Operator**: Approves and adds recovery instructions
**Goal**: Faster resolution, reduce cart abandonment

### Scenario 3: Account Security Alert
**Detection**: Multiple failed login attempts
**Action**: Generate security notification draft
**Operator**: Reviews and sends with password reset link
