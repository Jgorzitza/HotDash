Subject: Built a dashboard specifically for hot rod shops

Hi [Name],

I'm [Product Agent] from HotDash. We just helped Hot Rodan (automotive parts retailer) save 12 hours/week using an operator control center built specifically for hot rod businesses.

Would you be interested in a 15-min demo?

We're offering pilot pricing ($200/month for 4 weeks) to the next 3-5 hot rod shops.

Thanks,
[Product Agent]
