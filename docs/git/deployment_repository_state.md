## Deployment Readiness

### âœ… Deployment Branch Health
- **Branch**: deployment/work
- **Last Commit**: 2025-10-12T17:30:03Z (integrations agent)
- **Status**: Clean, no conflicts
- **Ready for deployment**: Yes

### âœ… Repository Integrity
- **Git fsck**: PASSED (no corruption detected)
- **Dangling objects**: Present (normal for active development)
- **No secrets detected**: âœ… Verified

### âœ… Branch Currency
- All active branches updated within last 48 hours
- No stale branches (>7 days) requiring cleanup
- All branches have clear purposes and ownership

## Cleanup Actions Taken

### âœ… Completed Cleanup
1. **Removed obsolete remote**: `clean` remote removed (was pointing to non-existent repository)
2. **Verified deployment branch**: deployment/work exists and is healthy
3. **Confirmed repository health**: No corruption or conflicts detected

### ðŸ”„ Branches Ready for Future Cleanup
- **marketing/work**: Merged into main, can be deleted after PR merge confirmation
- **Old analysis branches**: Monitor codex/* branches for continued relevance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- **None required**: Repository is in excellent health

### Future Maintenance
- Monitor `codex/*` branches - consider archiving if analysis is complete
- Consider deleting `marketing/work` after confirming merge to main
- Set up automated cleanup for branches older than 30 days

### Repository Best Practices Status
- âœ… Clear branch naming convention followed
- âœ… Active development isolated to work branches
- âœ… Deployment branch properly maintained
- âœ… No force-push to shared branches
- âœ… Backup branches preserved for safety

## Next Review Date
- **Next audit**: 2025-10-20 (or after next deployment cycle)
- **Owner**: git-cleanup agent
- **Criteria**: Repository health, branch currency, deployment readiness
