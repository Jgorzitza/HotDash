# Growth Engine Knowledge Base Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the complete integration of Growth Engine documentation into the knowledge base system, providing comprehensive search capabilities and context recovery for all agents.

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Documentation Structure

The Growth Engine knowledge base is organized in a hierarchical structure:

```
docs/growth-engine/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md                           # Searchable content index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ getting-started.md                 # Initial setup guide
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ best-practices.md                  # Implementation best practices
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ growth-engine-support-features.md  # Feature documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ growth-engine-support-framework.md # Framework documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ growth-engine-troubleshooting.md   # Troubleshooting guide
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kb-integration-guide.md           # This integration guide
```

### 2. Search Integration

The knowledge base is integrated with the existing KB search system through:

- **Enhanced Query Generation**: Growth Engine-specific search queries
- **Content Indexing**: Comprehensive searchable content index
- **Context Recovery**: Prevents redoing work by finding existing solutions
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provides actionable recommendations based on search results

### 3. Agent Integration

All agents can access Growth Engine documentation through:

- **Pre-task Search**: Automatic KB search before task execution
- **Context-Aware Queries**: Intelligent query generation based on task content
- **Evidence Logging**: All KB searches are logged for audit trail
- **Recommendation System**: Automated recommendations for implementation

## Search Capabilities

### 1. Phase-Based Search

Search by Growth Engine phases:

```bash
# Search for Phase 9 (MCP Evidence System)
npx tsx scripts/agent/kb-search.ts ENG-001 "MCP Evidence Implementation" engineer

## Implementation Details

### 1. KB Integration Service

The `app/services/kb-integration.server.ts` service provides:

```typescript
// Enhanced query generation for Growth Engine
function generateSearchQueries(
  taskTitle: string,
  taskDescription: string,
  assignedAgent: string
): string[] {
  const queries: string[] = [];
  
  // Growth Engine specific search
  if (taskTitle.toLowerCase().includes('growth engine') || 
      taskTitle.toLowerCase().includes('growth-engine')) {
    queries.push('Growth Engine implementation patterns and best practices');
    queries.push('Growth Engine troubleshooting and common issues');
    queries.push('Growth Engine integration with existing systems');
  }
  
  // ... other query generation logic
}
```

### 2. Search Script Integration

The `scripts/agent/kb-search.ts` script provides:

```typescript
// Pre-task KB search workflow
export async function preTaskKBSearch(
  taskId: string,
  taskTitle: string,
  taskDescription: string,
  assignedAgent: string
): Promise<KBContextSearch> {
  // Perform comprehensive KB search
  const searchResults = await searchTaskContext(
    taskId,
    taskTitle,
    taskDescription,
    assignedAgent
  );
  
  // Log results for audit trail
  await logKBSearch(taskId, searchResults, assignedAgent);
  
  return searchResults;
}
```

### 3. Test Integration

The `scripts/test-kb-integration.ts` script provides:

```typescript
// Comprehensive testing of KB integration
async function testKBIntegration() {
  // Test documentation structure
  // Test KB integration service
  // Test search functionality
  // Test content coverage
  // Test agent integration
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Agent Task Execution

Before executing any task, agents automatically search the KB:

```bash
# Agent starts task
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/agent/start-task.ts PILOT-001

# KB search is automatically performed
