## LlamaIndex MCP Capabilities

### What LlamaIndex MCP Provides

**1. Knowledge Base Indexing**:
- Ingests documents (policies, FAQs, troubleshooting guides)
- Creates semantic embeddings for fast retrieval
- Supports multiple document formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML)

**2. Semantic Search**:
- Natural language query ‚Üí relevant documents
- Ranked by relevance score
- Returns document chunks with citations

**3. MCP Integration**:
- Exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Available to all agents (Support, CX, Sales)
- Consistent interface for knowledge retrieval

**4. Query Tools**:
- `query_support`: Search knowledge base for support queries
- `query_policy`: Search policy documents
- `query_faq`: Search FAQ database

### Current Issues

**query_support Tool Error** (‚ö†Ô∏è P1):
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')"
- Impact: Tool shows 100% error rate
- Status: AI agent assigned to debug
- Timeline: 1-2 hours to fix
- Workaround: Other query tools functional

---

## Approval Queue Iterations (Post-Pilot)

### Phase 1 (Pilot): Full Human Oversight
- **All queries** require human approval
- Four actions: Approve, Edit, Escalate, Reject
- Operator sees full context + AI draft
- Learning loop: Track edits and rejections

### Phase 2 (Month 2): Confidence-Based Approval
- **High-confidence queries** (>90%) auto-approved
- Medium-confidence (70-90%) require approval
- Low-confidence (<70%) escalate to senior operator
- Operator can override confidence thresholds

### Phase 3 (Month 3): Smart Routing
- Simple queries (order status, tracking) ‚Üí auto-approved
- Complex queries (refunds, escalations) ‚Üí require approval
- Operator can flag query types for always-approve or always-review
- Machine learning improves routing over time

### Phase 4 (Month 4+): Full Automation
- 80-90% of queries auto-approved
- Operator monitors queue, intervenes only when needed
- Focus shifts to edge cases and complex issues
- Continuous learning from operator feedback
