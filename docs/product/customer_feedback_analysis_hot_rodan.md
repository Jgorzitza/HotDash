**Value**: Mobile-first approach enables on-the-go monitoring

---

**4. SEO Pulse Tile**:

---

### Constructive Feedback (What Needs Improvement)

**1. Tile Ordering**:
> "I wish Sales Pulse was at the top. I have to scroll to find it every time."

**Issue**: Fixed tile order doesn't match CEO's priorities  
**Solution**: Tile reordering (Quick Win #1, Week 2)  
**Priority**: P0

---

**2. Mobile UI**:
> "The tiles are a bit small on my phone. Hard to read the numbers while on the go."

**Issue**: Mobile responsiveness needs improvement  
**Solution**: Mobile UI optimization (Quick Win #2, Week 2)  
**Priority**: P0

---

**3. Performance**:

**Solution**: Performance optimization (Quick Win #3, Week 2)  
**Priority**: P0

---

**4. Historical Data**:
> "I want to see how sales trended over the last 7 days, not just today. Context matters."

### Feature Requests (What's Missing)

**1. Profit Margin Tracking** (P1):

**Details**: Calculate profit (revenue - cost), display profit margin %  
**Effort**: 8 hours (Data team to implement cost tracking)  
**Timeline**: Week 3  
**Value**: HIGH (revenue alone doesn't tell full story)

---

**2. Inventory Alerts** (P2):
> "I want to be notified when stock drops below 10 units. Right now I have to check manually."

**Details**: Push notifications or email alerts for low stock  
**Effort**: 16 hours (notification system + threshold config)

**Timeline**: Week 4  
**Value**: MEDIUM (nice-to-have for analysis)

---

**5. Shopify Action Buttons** (P2):
> "If I see a low-stock item, I should be able to reorder directly from the dashboard."

**Details**: Quick action buttons (reorder, update pricing, etc.)  
**Effort**: 20+ hours (Shopify API integration, action workflows)  
**Timeline**: Month 2  
**Value**: MEDIUM (convenience, but can use Shopify admin)

---
