# Feature Priority Matrix v2

**Version**: 2.0 (Updated for Hot Rodan pilot)  
**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Owner**: Product Agent  
**Purpose**: Prioritize features based on CEO requests, technical debt, and user value  
**Framework**: RICE Score (Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence √ó Ease)  

---

## Overview

**Goal**: Make data-driven decisions about what to build next

**Why Priority Matrix Matters**:
- Limited engineering time (1 engineer)
- CEO has many requests (can't do everything)
- Technical debt competes with features
- Need to maximize CEO value quickly

**Decision Framework**: RICE Score + CEO Request Override

---

## üéØ Prioritization Framework: RICE Score

**Formula**: `RICE = (Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence) / Effort`

### Reach (How many users affected?)
For Hot Rodan pilot (1 CEO user):
- **10**: CEO uses daily (every session)
- **7**: CEO uses weekly (multiple times)
- **4**: CEO uses monthly (occasionally)
- **1**: CEO uses rarely (edge case)

### Impact (How much does this improve experience?)
- **10**: Transformative (saves hours/week, prevents major issues)
- **7-9**: Significant improvement (saves 30+ min/week)
- **4-6**: Moderate improvement (saves 10-30 min/week)
- **1-3**: Minor improvement (nice to have)

### Confidence (How sure are we this will work?)
- **10**: CEO explicitly requested (validated need)
- **8-9**: Strong evidence from analytics/feedback
- **5-7**: Hypothesis based on assumptions
- **1-4**: Speculative (no validation)

### Effort (How hard to build?)
- **1**: < 4 hours (quick win)
- **2**: 4-8 hours (half day)
- **3**: 1-2 days
- **5**: 3-5 days (week)
- **8**: 1-2 weeks
- **13**: 2-4 weeks (epic)

### RICE Score Interpretation
- **‚â•50**: P0 - Do immediately (this week)
- **25-49**: P1 - Do soon (Week 2-3)
- **10-24**: P2 - Do later (Month 2)
- **<10**: Backlog - Maybe never

## üö® CEO Request Override

**Rule**: If CEO explicitly requests a feature, it becomes P0 regardless of RICE score

**Why**: CEO is the customer, CEO knows their pain, CEO adoption is critical

**Process**:
1. CEO requests feature: "I need X"
2. Product documents request (use template below)
3. Product calculates RICE with CEO multiplier:
   - Confidence = 10 (CEO validated)
   - Impact = CEO's stated impact (usually 8-10)
4. Product prioritizes as P0 or P1 based on effort
5. Product communicates timeline to CEO

**Example**:
> CEO: "I need to see profit margin on the Sales Pulse tile"

**RICE Calculation**:
- Reach: 10 (CEO uses daily)
- Impact: 8 (CEO stated need)
- Confidence: 10 (CEO requested)
- Effort: 3 (1-2 days to add)
- **RICE: (10 √ó 8 √ó 10) / 3 = 267** ‚Üí P0

**Timeline**: 1-2 days ‚Üí Add to this week's sprint

## üîß Technical Debt Prioritization

**Technical debt competes with features for engineering time**

### When to Prioritize Tech Debt

**Prioritize tech debt if**:
- ‚úÖ Blocks future features (refactor required first)
- ‚úÖ Causes frequent bugs (stability issue)
- ‚úÖ Impacts CEO-facing performance (slow loading)
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerability (compliance risk)
- ‚úÖ Prevents scaling (will break with more users)

**Defer tech debt if**:
- ‚ùå Doesn't impact CEO experience
- ‚ùå Can be worked around easily
- ‚ùå Low risk of breaking
- ‚ùå Purely internal "nice to have"
- ‚ùå Only matters at 100+ users

### Current Technical Debt Items

| # | Tech Debt Item | CEO Impact | Risk | Effort | Priority |
|---|----------------|------------|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Database query optimization | High (slow tiles) | Medium | 3 | P0 |
| 2 | Error handling improvements | High (crashes) | High | 2 | P0 |
| 3 | Test coverage expansion | Low | Low | 5 | P2 |
| 4 | Code refactoring (clean up) | None | Low | 8 | Backlog |
| 5 | Documentation updates | None | Low | 3 | Backlog |

**Rule**: Tech debt with "High CEO Impact" or "High Risk" = P0/P1

---

## üíé User Value Categories

### High Value (CEO saves hours/week)
**Characteristics**:
- Automates manual work
- Prevents costly mistakes
- Provides early warnings
- Enables fast decisions

**Examples**:
- Smart reorder alerts (prevents stockouts = $$$)
- Anomaly detection (catches issues early)
- Approval queue (fast decisions)
- Performance optimization (daily use)

**Priority**: P0-P1 (do first)

---

### Medium Value (CEO saves minutes/day)
**Characteristics**:
- Improves convenience
- Reduces friction
- Personalizes experience
- Increases engagement

**Examples**:
- Tile customization (personalization)
- Weekly email summary (re-engagement)
- Mobile polish (convenience)
- Onboarding tour (reduces learning curve)

**Priority**: P1-P2 (do after high value)

---

### Low Value (Nice to have)
**Characteristics**:
- Rarely used
- Not CEO-facing
- Low frequency need
- Speculative benefit

**Examples**:
- Advanced analytics (CEO doesn't need complexity)
- Custom reports (low frequency)
- API access (CEO won't use directly)
- White-label branding (not pilot need)

**Priority**: P2-Backlog (do much later or never)

## üéØ Prioritization Examples

### Example 1: CEO Request (High Priority)

**Request**: "I need to see profit margin, not just revenue"

**RICE Calculation**:
- Reach: 10 (CEO uses Sales Pulse daily)
- Impact: 9 (CEO needs this for pricing decisions)
- Confidence: 10 (CEO explicitly requested)
- Effort: 3 (1-2 days to add margin calculation)
- **RICE: (10 √ó 9 √ó 10) / 3 = 300** ‚Üí P0

**Decision**: Add to this week's sprint, target 2-day completion

---

### Example 2: Team Suggestion (Medium Priority)

**Suggestion**: "Add sparkline charts to tiles"

**RICE Calculation**:
- Reach: 10 (affects all tiles)
- Impact: 5 (nice visual improvement, not critical)
- Confidence: 6 (hypothesis, not validated)
- Effort: 5 (3-5 days to implement)
- **RICE: (10 √ó 5 √ó 6) / 5 = 60** ‚Üí P1

**Decision**: Add to Week 2-3 roadmap, after CEO requests

---

### Example 3: Technical Debt (High Priority)

**Debt**: "Database queries slow, tiles load >5 seconds"

**Assessment**:
- CEO Impact: High (CEO notices slow loading)
- Risk: Medium (could get worse with more data)
- Effort: 3 (1-2 days to optimize)
- **Priority: P0** (impacts CEO experience)

**Decision**: Fix this week, before adding new features

---

### Example 4: Low-Value Feature (Backlog)

**Suggestion**: "Add API access for third-party integrations"

**RICE Calculation**:
- Reach: 1 (CEO won't use API directly)
- Impact: 7 (could be valuable for integrations)
- Confidence: 4 (speculative, no validation)
- Effort: 13 (2-4 weeks to build API)
- **RICE: (1 √ó 7 √ó 4) / 13 = 2** ‚Üí Backlog

**Decision**: Defer indefinitely, focus on CEO-facing features
