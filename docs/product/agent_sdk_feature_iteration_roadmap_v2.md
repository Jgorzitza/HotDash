## Phase 2 Features (Month 1-2: November-December 2025)

### Category 1: Approval Queue UX Enhancements

**Based on Expected Pilot Feedback**:

#### Feature 2.1: Bulk Actions
**Problem**: Operators reviewing 10-15 drafts/hour need faster workflow

**Solution**:
- Select multiple high-confidence drafts (>90%) and approve all at once
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+A (approve), Ctrl+E (edit), Ctrl+X (escalate), Ctrl+R (reject)
- Bulk confidence filter: "Show me all >95% confidence drafts"
- Quick select: "Select all >90% confidence"

**Success Metric**: Drafts reviewed per hour increases from 15 → 20 (33% improvement)

**Timeline**: Week 1 post-pilot (November 11-15, 2025)

**Effort**: 2-3 days (Engineer)

---

#### Feature 2.2: Inline Editing
**Problem**: Switching between review and edit modes is slow

**Solution**:
- Edit draft text directly in approval card (no modal/separate page)
- Track changes highlighted (AI text vs operator edits)
- Learning loop captures inline edits for training
- Undo/redo functionality
- Auto-save drafts

**Success Metric**: Edit time reduced from 2 min → 1 min average (50% improvement)

**Timeline**: Week 2 post-pilot (November 18-22, 2025)

**Effort**: 3-4 days (Engineer + Designer)

---

#### Feature 2.3: Quick Response Templates
**Problem**: Common edits (adding empathy, adjusting tone) are repetitive

**Solution**:
- Preset templates: "Add apology", "Add empathy", "Make more concise", "Add urgency"
- One-click template application
- Custom templates per operator
- Template library shared across team

**Success Metric**: 30% of edits use templates, saving 30 seconds per edit

**Timeline**: Week 3 post-pilot (November 25-29, 2025)

**Effort**: 2 days (Engineer)

---

#### Feature 2.4: Smart Queue Sorting
**Problem**: Operators want to prioritize urgent/high-value tickets

**Solution**:
- Sort by: Confidence (high/low), Urgency (VIP customers, time-sensitive), Complexity (simple first)
- Filter by: Query type, Customer tier, Confidence range
- Save custom views per operator
- Default view: High confidence + High urgency first

**Success Metric**: Operators handle urgent tickets 50% faster

**Timeline**: Week 4 post-pilot (December 2-6, 2025)

**Effort**: 2-3 days (Engineer)

---

### Category 2: AI Quality Improvements

#### Feature 2.5: Source Citation Display
**Problem**: Operators want to verify AI's information sources

**Solution**:
- Display knowledge base sources used (policy docs, FAQs, product specs)
- Link to original documents
- Highlight relevant excerpts
- Confidence score per source

**Success Metric**: Operator trust increases (satisfaction: 70% → 80%)

**Timeline**: Week 1-2 post-pilot (November 11-22, 2025)

**Effort**: 3 days (Engineer)

---

#### Feature 2.6: Confidence Score Breakdown
**Problem**: Operators don't understand why confidence is high/low

**Solution**:
- Show confidence factors: Query clarity (90%), KB coverage (80%), Policy match (95%)
- Explain low confidence: "Missing product specification" or "Ambiguous customer intent"
- Suggest improvements: "Add customer order number for higher confidence"

**Success Metric**: Operators understand confidence scores (reduce "why is this low?" questions by 80%)

**Timeline**: Week 2-3 post-pilot (November 18-29, 2025)

**Effort**: 3-4 days (Engineer + AI)

---

#### Feature 2.7: Learning Loop Feedback
**Problem**: Operators want to teach AI from their edits

**Solution**:
- When operator edits draft, ask: "Should AI learn from this edit?" (Yes/No)
- If Yes, capture edit as training example
- Show operator: "AI learned from 15 of your edits this week"
- Monthly report: "Your edits improved AI accuracy by 5%"

**Success Metric**: AI accuracy improves 5-10% per month from operator feedback

**Timeline**: Week 3-4 post-pilot (November 25 - December 6, 2025)

**Effort**: 4-5 days (Engineer + AI)

---

### Category 3: Performance Optimizations

#### Feature 2.8: Faster Draft Generation
**Problem**: 5-second draft generation feels slow

**Solution**:
- Optimize LlamaIndex queries (parallel search)
- Cache frequent queries (order status, tracking)
- Preload customer context when ticket arrives
- Target: <2 seconds draft generation

**Success Metric**: Draft generation time reduced from 5s → 2s (60% faster)

**Timeline**: Week 1-2 post-pilot (November 11-22, 2025)

**Effort**: 3-4 days (Engineer + AI)

---

#### Feature 2.9: Approval Queue Latency Reduction
**Problem**: Target <30 seconds approval latency

**Solution**:
- Optimize UI rendering (lazy load, virtualization)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Reduce API calls (batch requests)
- Prefetch next 5 drafts in queue

**Success Metric**: Approval latency reduced from 45s → 20s (55% faster)

**Timeline**: Week 2-3 post-pilot (November 18-29, 2025)

**Effort**: 3 days (Engineer)

---

## Phase 3 Features (Month 3-4: January-February 2026)
