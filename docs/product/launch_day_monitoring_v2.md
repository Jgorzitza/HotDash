## üìä Real-Time Monitoring Queries

### Query 1: CEO Activity Summary

**Purpose**: Check if CEO is using the dashboard

**SQL**:
```sql
-- CEO Activity Today
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as total_sessions,
  MIN(login_at) as first_login_time,
  MAX(CASE WHEN logout_at IS NOT NULL THEN logout_at END) as last_logout_time,
  AVG(session_duration_seconds) as avg_session_seconds,
  SUM(session_duration_seconds) as total_time_seconds,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT device_type, ', ' ORDER BY device_type) as devices_used,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type = 'mobile') as mobile_sessions,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type = 'desktop') as desktop_sessions
FROM dashboard_sessions
WHERE customer_id = 'hot-rodan'
  AND DATE(login_at) = CURRENT_DATE
  AND user_id LIKE '%ceo%'; -- Adjust to actual CEO user_id
```

**Expected Day 1**:
- `total_sessions`: ‚â•1 (ideally 2-3)
- `first_login_time`: Within 2 hours of launch email
- `avg_session_seconds`: 300-600 (5-10 minutes)
- `total_time_seconds`: ‚â•300 (5+ minutes total)

**Red Flags**:
- `total_sessions` = 0 after 2 hours ‚Üí CEO not logging in
- `avg_session_seconds` < 60 ‚Üí CEO not engaging
- `total_sessions` = 1 and `avg_session_seconds` < 120 ‚Üí Quick bounce

---

### Query 2: Tile Engagement

**Purpose**: See which tiles CEO is using

**SQL**:
```sql
-- Tile Usage Today
SELECT 
  tile_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_interactions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as sessions_with_tile,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE interaction_type = 'view') as views,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE interaction_type = 'click') as clicks,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE interaction_type = 'expand') as expands,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE interaction_type = 'refresh') as refreshes,
  MIN(interaction_at) as first_interaction,
  MAX(interaction_at) as last_interaction
FROM tile_interactions
WHERE customer_id = 'hot-rodan'
  AND DATE(interaction_at) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY tile_name
ORDER BY total_interactions DESC;
```

**Expected Day 1**:
- All 5 tiles have ‚â•1 view
- Top 2-3 tiles have clicks/expands (CEO exploring)
- At least 1 refresh (CEO checking for updates)

**Red Flags**:
- 0 tile interactions ‚Üí Dashboard not loading or CEO not exploring
- Only 1 tile viewed ‚Üí CEO stuck or confused
- No clicks/expands ‚Üí CEO just glancing, not engaging

**Tiles to Track**:
1. `sales-pulse` - Daily sales metrics
2. `inventory-watch` - Low stock alerts
3. `fulfillment-flow` - Order processing
4. `cx-pulse` - Customer support metrics
5. `seo-pulse` - SEO traffic anomalies

---

### Query 3: Approval Queue Activity

**Purpose**: Check if CEO is using approval queue

**SQL**:
```sql
-- Approval Actions Today
SELECT 
  approval_type,
  COUNT(*) as total_actions,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE action = 'approve') as approved,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE action = 'reject') as rejected,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE action = 'defer') as deferred,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE action = 'edit') as edited,
  AVG(time_to_decision_seconds) as avg_decision_seconds,
  MIN(time_to_decision_seconds) as fastest_decision_seconds,
  MAX(time_to_decision_seconds) as slowest_decision_seconds
FROM approval_actions
WHERE customer_id = 'hot-rodan'
  AND DATE(approved_at) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY approval_type
ORDER BY total_actions DESC;
```

**Expected Day 1**:
- ‚â•1 approval action (CEO trying feature)
- `avg_decision_seconds`: 10-60 (quick decisions)
- Mix of approve/reject (CEO exploring options)

**Red Flags**:
- 0 approvals ‚Üí Approval queue empty or CEO not finding it
- `avg_decision_seconds` > 300 ‚Üí CEO confused or hesitant
- All deferred ‚Üí CEO not confident to take action

---

### Query 4: Error Tracking

**Purpose**: Catch bugs immediately

**SQL**:
```sql
-- Check application logs for errors
-- (This depends on your logging setup - adjust as needed)

-- If using Supabase Edge Functions logs:
SELECT 
  created_at,
  level,
  message,
  metadata
FROM edge_function_logs
WHERE level IN ('error', 'fatal')
  AND created_at > CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- If using custom error tracking table:
SELECT 
  error_type,
  error_message,
  stack_trace,
  user_id,
  created_at
FROM error_logs
WHERE created_at > CURRENT_DATE
  AND customer_id = 'hot-rodan'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Expected Day 1**: 0 errors

**Red Flags**:
- Any error with `level = 'fatal'` ‚Üí P0 bug
- Repeated errors (>3 same error) ‚Üí Systematic issue
- Errors during CEO session ‚Üí CEO experiencing bugs
