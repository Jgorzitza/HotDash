## Current Manual Support Workflow (Before Agent SDK)

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Ticket Arrives** (0 min)
- Customer sends email or chat message
- Ticket created in support system (Chatwoot/Zendesk)
- Notification sent to operator
- Ticket enters queue

**Step 2: Operator Reads Ticket** (1-2 min)
- Operator opens ticket
- Reads customer message
- Identifies query type (order status, refund, product question, etc.)
- Assesses urgency and complexity

**Step 3: Context Gathering** (5-10 min)
- **Shopify Admin Lookup** (2-3 min):
  - Search for customer by email
  - Find order history
  - Check order status, tracking, fulfillment
- **Product Catalog Search** (1-2 min):
  - Look up product details
  - Check inventory availability
  - Verify pricing and specifications
- **Policy Review** (2-5 min):
  - Review refund policy
  - Check shipping policy
  - Verify warranty terms
- **Previous Ticket History** (1-2 min):
  - Check if customer has contacted before
  - Review past issues and resolutions

**Step 4: Draft Response** (5-15 min)
- Compose email/chat response
- Include relevant information (order status, tracking, policy details)
- Add personalization (customer name, order number)
- Proofread for accuracy and tone
- Add links or attachments if needed

**Step 5: Send Response** (1 min)
- Send email or chat message
- Update ticket status
- Add internal notes
- Set follow-up reminder if needed

**Step 6: Follow-Up** (0-30 min, if needed)

## Time Savings Calculation

### Per-Ticket Time Savings

**High-Automation Queries** (40% of tickets):
- Current: 8-9 min
- With Agent SDK: 1-2 min
- Savings: **6-7 min per ticket**

**Medium-Automation Queries** (40% of tickets):
- Current: 19-21 min
- With Agent SDK: 5-8 min
- Savings: **11-16 min per ticket**

**Low-Automation Queries** (20% of tickets):
- Current: 36 min
- With Agent SDK: 20-25 min
- Savings: **11-16 min per ticket**

### Daily Time Savings (Per Operator)

**Assumptions**:
- Operator handles 25 tickets/day (average)
- 40% high-automation (10 tickets)
- 40% medium-automation (10 tickets)
- 20% low-automation (5 tickets)

**Calculations**:
- High-automation: 10 tickets × 6.5 min = 65 min saved
- Medium-automation: 10 tickets × 13.5 min = 135 min saved
- Low-automation: 5 tickets × 13.5 min = 68 min saved
- **Total Daily Savings**: 268 min = **4.5 hours per day**

**Current Workday**: 6.5 hours on tickets
**With Agent SDK**: 2 hours on tickets (4.5 hours saved)
**Efficiency Gain**: **69% more efficient**

## Capacity Increase

### Current Capacity (Manual)
- **Tickets Per Day**: 20-30 tickets
- **Time Per Ticket**: 45 min average
- **Total Time**: 6.5 hours/day

### New Capacity (With Agent SDK)
- **Time Per Ticket**: 15 min average (with AI assistance)
- **Available Time**: 6.5 hours/day (same)
- **New Capacity**: 26 tickets/day (current) → **40-50 tickets/day** (with AI)
- **Capacity Increase**: **50-90%**

**Alternative Use of Time Savings**:
- Handle same 25 tickets in 2 hours (instead of 6.5 hours)
- Use 4.5 hours for:
  - Proactive customer outreach
  - Knowledge base improvements
  - Training and mentorship
  - Complex problem-solving
  - Customer success initiatives

- 1,125 hours × $32/hour = **$36,000/year saved per operator**

**Alternative: Capacity Increase Value**:
- 50% more tickets handled = 50% more revenue supported
- If operator supports $500K revenue/year → $250K additional revenue capacity
- Assuming 20% margin → **$50K additional profit potential**

### ROI Calculation (Conservative)

**Option 1: Time Savings Focus**
```
Annual Savings: $36,000 (time saved)
Annual Cost: $7,200 (Agent SDK)
Net Savings: $28,800
ROI: ($28,800 / $7,200) × 100% = 400% ROI
```

**Option 2: Capacity Increase Focus**
```
Annual Value: $50,000 (additional revenue capacity)
Annual Cost: $7,200 (Agent SDK)
Net Value: $42,800
ROI: ($42,800 / $7,200) × 100% = 594% ROI
```

**Payback Period**: 2.4 months (Agent SDK pays for itself in < 3 months)

---

### 10-Operator Team ROI

**Total Annual Savings** (Time Savings Focus):
- 10 operators × $28,800 = **$288,000/year**
- Total Agent SDK cost: 10 × $7,200 = $72,000/year
- Net savings: $216,000/year

**Total Annual Value** (Capacity Increase Focus):
- 10 operators × $42,800 = **$428,000/year**
- Total Agent SDK cost: $72,000/year
- Net value: $356,000/year

**3-Year ROI**:
- Time Savings: $648,000 saved
- Capacity Increase: $1,068,000 value created

## Workflow Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Agent SDK (Manual)

**Ticket Arrives** → Operator reads (2 min) → Context gathering (8 min) → Draft response (12 min) → Send (1 min) → **Total: 23 min**

**Operator Workload**:
- 25 tickets/day × 23 min = 575 min = **9.6 hours/day** (overloaded!)
- Reality: Operators handle 20-25 tickets/day in 6.5 hours (rushed, stressed)

---

### After Agent SDK (Automated)

**High-Automation Ticket** (40%):
**Ticket Arrives** → Agent SDK auto-drafts (5 sec) → Operator reviews (30 sec) → Approve (10 sec) → **Total: 45 sec**

**Medium-Automation Ticket** (40%):
**Ticket Arrives** → Agent SDK auto-drafts (5 sec) → Operator reviews (2 min) → Edit (2 min) → Approve (10 sec) → **Total: 4.5 min**

**Low-Automation Ticket** (20%):
**Ticket Arrives** → Agent SDK researches (10 sec) → Operator writes (15 min) → AI proofreads (10 sec) → Send (1 min) → **Total: 16 min**

**Operator Workload**:
- 10 high-automation × 0.75 min = 7.5 min
- 10 medium-automation × 4.5 min = 45 min
- 5 low-automation × 16 min = 80 min
- **Total: 132.5 min = 2.2 hours/day** (comfortable, sustainable)

**Time Freed Up**: 6.5 hours - 2.2 hours = **4.3 hours/day**
