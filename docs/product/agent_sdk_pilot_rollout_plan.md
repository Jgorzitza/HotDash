### Traffic Allocation

**Week 1 (10% Traffic)**:
- Pilot operators handle 10% of incoming tickets via Agent SDK
- Remaining 90% handled manually (normal process)
- Focus: High-automation queries only (order status, tracking, product info)
- Goal: Build confidence, identify bugs, refine UI

**Week 2 (30% Traffic)**:
- Pilot operators handle 30% of incoming tickets via Agent SDK
- Remaining 70% handled manually
- Focus: Add medium-automation queries (refunds, recommendations, shipping)
- Goal: Test at scale, measure time savings, validate ROI

**Post-Pilot (50-80% Traffic)**:
- All 10 operators handle 50-80% of tickets via Agent SDK
- Remaining 20-50% handled manually (complex queries)
- Focus: Full automation capabilities
- Goal: Achieve target metrics, maximize ROI

---

### Query Types (Pilot Scope)

**Week 1 Queries** (High-Automation Only):
- ✅ Order status ("Where is my order?")
- ✅ Tracking number ("What's my tracking number?")
- ✅ Product information ("Does this part fit my car?")
- ❌ Refunds (not yet)
- ❌ Recommendations (not yet)
- ❌ Technical support (not yet)

**Week 2 Queries** (Add Medium-Automation):

- Emphasize "AI assists, not replaces"
- Collect feedback daily
- Address concerns immediately
- Celebrate wins publicly

---

### Risk 2: Low AI Accuracy

**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Start with high-automation queries only

---

### Risk 3: Approval Queue Bottleneck

**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Target <60 second approval latency
- Optimize UI for speed
