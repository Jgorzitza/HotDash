## üîß Technical Implementation

### Fixes Applied:

1. **OpenAI Configuration** (`buildIndex.ts`, `query.ts`):
   - Added `Settings.embedModel` (text-embedding-3-small)
   - Added `Settings.llm` (gpt-4o-mini)

2. **Index Persistence** (`buildIndex.ts`):
   - Implemented `storageContextFromDefaults` with `persistDir`
   - Persists to: doc_store.json, index_store.json, vector_store.json

3. **Query Caching** (`cache.ts`, `query.ts`):
   - 5-minute TTL for repeated queries
   - Automatic cleanup every 60 seconds
   - Cache key includes query + parameters

4. **Schema Corrections** (all loaders):
   - Fixed `support_curated_replies` schema (message_body)
   - Fixed `decision_sync_events` table name and columns
   - Fixed `observability_logs` table name
   - Added flexible ordering columns

5. **Zod v3 Compatibility** (`collector.ts`, `schema.ts`):
   - Fixed type-only imports
   - Fixed z.record() signatures

## üìà Quality Assurance

### Golden Dataset Created:

**File**: `scripts/ai/llama-workflow/eval/hotrodan-qa-dataset.jsonl`  
**Test Cases**: 60 (exceeded 50+ target by 20%)

**Coverage Areas**:
- Company information & policies: 8 cases
- Product specifications: 15 cases
- Technical sizing & selection: 12 cases
- Installation procedures: 8 cases
- Application guidance: 10 cases
- Troubleshooting: 7 cases

**Quality Thresholds**:
- BLEU score: >0.3 (n-gram overlap)
- ROUGE-L: >0.4 (structural similarity)
- Citation accuracy: >80% (required sources present)

- [ ] Run golden dataset evaluation
- [ ] Measure cache hit rates
- [ ] Review query patterns
- [ ] Update test cases based on production usage

### Monthly Tasks:
- [ ] Expand golden dataset to 100+ cases
- [ ] Optimize chunk sizes if needed
- [ ] Review and update knowledge sources
- [ ] Performance tuning based on production metrics

### As Needed:
- [ ] Add new hotrodan.com content (when site updated)
- [ ] Index curated support replies (when Support provides content)
- [ ] Analyze production query patterns (when traffic available)
- [ ] Optimize for common queries (based on usage data)
