## Contingency Plans

### Scenario 1: System Down

**If API/Queue is Down**:
1. Immediately post in Slack: "System issue detected, investigating"
2. Escalate to Engineer (ping @engineering-oncall)
3. Switch operators to manual workflow temporarily
4. Post ETA updates every 15 minutes
5. Once fixed: "System back up, resuming pilot"

**Decision**: If down >2 hours, consider pausing pilot for the day

---

### Scenario 2: All Drafts Are Wrong

**If Operators Report Major Quality Issues**:
1. Check KB sync status (run `npm run ai:verify-kb-coverage`)
2. Check API health (are we getting correct data?)
3. If KB issue: Run emergency sync
4. If API issue: Escalate to Engineer
5. Post in Slack: "We're investigating quality issues, hold tight"

**Decision**: If quality <50% accurate, pause pilot and fix

---

### Scenario 3: Operator Wants to Quit

**If Operator Says "I hate this, I want out"**:
1. Jump on a call immediately (don't handle via Slack)
2. Listen: What's frustrating them?
3. Validate: "I hear you, this is hard"
4. Problem-solve: Can we fix the issue?
5. Give option: "You can opt out, no pressure"
6. Follow up: Share feedback with team

**Decision**: Operator happiness > pilot success. Let them opt out if needed.

---

### Scenario 4: Security/Data Issue

**If Operator Reports Data Leakage or Security Concern**:
1. **IMMEDIATELY PAUSE PILOT** (stop all traffic)
2. Escalate to Manager + Engineer
3. Post in Slack: "Pilot paused for security review"
4. Investigate thoroughly (30-60 min)
5. If false alarm: Resume
6. If real issue: Pilot stays paused until fixed

**Priority**: Security > Pilot > Everything Else

---
