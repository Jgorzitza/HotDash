# Video Script: Notifications & Integrations

## Duration
90–110 seconds

## Outline
1. **Opening (0:00–0:10)** — Position notifications as the safety net for SLA breaches and integration health.
2. **Configure Alerts (0:10–0:45)** — Navigate to Settings → Notifications, toggle desktop/email/SMS, set quiet hours, send a test.
3. **Integration Health (0:45–1:15)** — Jump to Settings → Integrations, reconnect Publer, confirm Chatwoot `/rails/health` status, highlight alert banners when services fail.
4. **Wrap (1:15–1:30)** — Direct viewers to troubleshooting table if an integration keeps failing.

## Narration Highlights
- Remind operators HIGH risk alerts bypass quiet hours automatically.
- Encourage monthly verification of integration tokens before campaign pushes.
- Note that reconnecting Publer rehydrates social approvals in seconds.

## Capture Checklist
- Show quiet hours dialog and the success toast for "Send test".
- Display a disconnected integration banner and the reconnect flow.
- Include the help center link from the integration card.
