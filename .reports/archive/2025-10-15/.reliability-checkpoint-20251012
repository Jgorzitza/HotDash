✅ RELIABILITY AGENT - ACTIVE & PRODUCTIVE
Session: 2025-10-12T02:49:00Z
=================================================================

STATUS: Active - Resumed work after launch gates progress (5/7 complete)

=================================================================
TASKS COMPLETED (2/3)
=================================================================

✅ Task C: Performance Baseline Documentation
   - Staging latency: 587ms avg (under 800ms target)
   - Chatwoot response: 308ms (excellent)
   - Fly resource usage documented
   - Baseline report created
   - Evidence: reports/reliability/2025-10-12-performance-baseline.md

✅ Task 1: Local Supabase Readiness
   - Supabase running and healthy
   - DATABASE_URL verified (local Supabase)
   - Prisma migrations working
   - occ-log edge function operational
   - Canonical toolkit compliant

=================================================================
PENDING TASKS
=================================================================

⏭️ Task 3: ?mock=0 Latency Optimization
   - Current: 587ms (good)
   - Target: <300ms (optimal)
   - Requires: Deployment coordination

=================================================================
NORTH STAR ALIGNMENT
=================================================================

✅ IMPROVED - Focused on practical launch work:
  - Performance baselines for post-launch monitoring
  - Local dev environment verification
  - Avoided premature optimization
  - Evidence-based work

Lesson Applied: Check every task against North Star mission
Mission: "Trustworthy operator-first control center in Shopify Admin"

=================================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES (Unchanged)
=================================================================

⚠️ Chatwoot worker: 512MB → OOM risk → needs 2GB
   Status: Pending approval (requires remote change)

⚠️ Staging DB: Fly Postgres (canonical toolkit violation)
   Status: Escalated to manager

=================================================================
