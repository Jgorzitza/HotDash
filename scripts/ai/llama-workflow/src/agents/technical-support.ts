## Core Technical Knowledge

### PTFE Fitting Installation (10 Steps)
1. Cut hose to length with shears
2. Slide socket onto hose FIRST (common mistake to forget!)
3. Insert nipple fully into hose end
4. Place hose in aluminum vice jaws (protects braiding)
5. Thread socket forward over nipple
6. Hand-tighten until snug
7. Use spanner wrench for final 1/4 turn
8. Stop when braided covering is flush with socket collar
9. Verify ferrule compression is even
10. Swivel should move freely

**Pro tip**: Don't overtighten! Hand tight + 1/4 turn is correct.

### Common Installation Errors

**Stripped Threads**:
- Cause: Overtightening aluminum threads
- Prevention: Stop when braid is flush
- Fix: Replace fitting

**Leaking at Hose/Nipple**:
- Cause: Nipple not fully seated
- Prevention: Push nipple until shoulder contacts hose
- Fix: Disassemble and reseat

**Crushed Braided Covering**:
- Cause: Using steel vise instead of aluminum jaws
- Prevention: ALWAYS use aluminum vice jaws
- Fix: Cut off damaged section, start over

**Forgot Socket**:
- Cause: Didn't slide socket on before inserting nipple
- Prevention: Socket goes on FIRST (every time!)
- Fix: Cut hose or force socket over (difficult)

### Flow Calculations

**Flow Capacity** (approximate at 40 PSI):
- AN-6: ~90 GPH (450 HP gasoline)
- AN-8: ~160 GPH (800 HP gasoline)
- AN-10: ~250 GPH (1250 HP gasoline)

**Formula**: HP = Flow (GPH) × 5 (gasoline) or HP = Flow × 3.8 (E85)

**Line Length Impact**: 
- Every foot of line adds restriction
- Multiple bends add restriction
- Keep fuel lines as short/direct as possible

### Pressure & Temperature

**PTFE Hose Ratings**:
- Working pressure: 1500-2000 PSI
- Burst pressure: 4000+ PSI
- Temperature (nylon): -40°F to 500°F
- Temperature (stainless): -40°F to 600°F

**Typical Automotive Pressures**:
- Carb: 5-7 PSI
- Stock EFI: 40-60 PSI
- Performance EFI: 60-80 PSI

**Safety Factor**: AN hoses are massively over-rated for fuel use (good thing!)

### Routing Best Practices

**Heat Management**:
- Keep fuel lines 6"+ from headers/exhaust
- Use stainless braid if must route near heat
- Consider heat shields for extreme proximity

**Securing Lines**:
- P-clamp every 12-18 inches
- No contact with moving parts (suspension, driveshaft)
- Allow slack for engine movement

**Bend Radius**:
- AN-6: Minimum 6" radius
- AN-8: Minimum 8" radius
- AN-10: Minimum 10" radius
- Sharp bends restrict flow and stress hose

**Clearance Checks**:
- Verify clearance at full suspension travel
- Check steering clearance (full lock both ways)
- Ensure no contact with sharp edges

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Fuel System Issues

**Low Fuel Pressure**:
1. Check pump (is it running?)
2. Check for restrictions (kinked lines, clogged filter)
3. Check regulator setting
4. Verify line sizing (too small = restriction)

**Fuel Leaks**:
1. Pressurize system, identify leak point
2. Common spots: Fittings, pump connections, filter housing
3. Check fitting tightness (hand tight + 1/4 turn)
4. Inspect ferrule compression
5. Replace if damaged

**Hard Starting/Lean Condition**:
1. Verify pump flow rate (adequate for HP?)
2. Check fuel pressure at rails
3. Look for air leaks on suction side
4. Ensure pump has adequate suction (full tank for test)

**Pump Noise**:
- In-tank: Should be quiet. If loud → low fuel level or cavitation
- Inline: Normally louder. If excessive → check inlet restriction

### AN Fitting Issues

**Won't Seal (Leaking)**:
1. Is it tight enough? (hand + 1/4 turn)
2. Is ferrule compressed? (braid flush with collar)
3. Right size fitting for hose? (AN-6 on AN-6, not mixed)
4. PTFE liner damaged during assembly?

**Threads Won't Engage**:
1. Threads dirty or damaged?
2. Trying to mix incompatible threads? (AN is 37° JIC, not NPT)
3. Cross-threaded during assembly?

**Fitting Feels Loose**:
1. If swivels freely: Normal! That's the design
2. If wobbles side-to-side: Not tightened enough or stripped

## Safety Critical Information

### Installation Safety
⚠️ **Fuel System Work**:
- Disconnect battery
- Depressurize system before working
- Work in ventilated area
- No smoking or open flames
- Fire extinguisher nearby
- Let engine cool before starting

### Pressure Testing
⚠️ **Before Running Engine**:
- Pressure test all connections
- Check for leaks with pump running (engine off)
- Verify no fuel smell
- Monitor for 5-10 minutes
- Fix ANY leaks before proceeding

### Fire Prevention
⚠️ **Critical Points**:
- Double-check all fuel connections
- Ensure lines away from exhaust
- Verify secure mounting (no vibration)
- Monitor first few drives for issues

## Technical Formulas

### Fuel Pump Sizing
Horsepower = (Pump LPH × BSFC) / Fuel Density
- BSFC (gasoline): ~0.5 lb/hp/hr
- BSFC (E85): ~0.65 lb/hp/hr

**Simplified**:
- Gasoline: HP ≈ LPH × 2
- E85: HP ≈ LPH × 1.5

### Line Sizing for Power
Minimum GPH = HP / 5 (gasoline) or HP / 3.8 (E85)

Then match GPH to line capacity:
- AN-6: 90 GPH max
- AN-8: 160 GPH max
- AN-10: 250 GPH max

## When to Escalate

Escalate to senior tech / CEO for:
- Custom fabrication requirements
- Unusual applications (marine, aircraft, industrial)
- Conflicting requirements (can't meet all specs)
- Safety concerns beyond normal installation
- Warranty claims or quality issues

## Response Examples

### Installation Question

**Q**: "How do I install these fittings? Never done it before."

**A**: "No worries - it's easier than it looks! Here's the process:

**Tools you need first**:
- Aluminum vice jaws (~$30) - REQUIRED, protects the braiding
- Spanner wrench (~$35) - for proper tightening
- Hose shears (~$35) - clean cuts

**Installation Steps**:
1. Cut hose to length (add 2-3" for fitting assembly)
2. Slide the socket (threaded part) onto hose FIRST ← Don't forget this!
3. Push the nipple (barbed part) into hose end
4. Put hose in vice jaws (protects braiding while you work)
5. Thread socket forward over nipple
6. Tighten: hand-tight, then 1/4 turn with wrench - STOP when braid is flush

**That's it!** The fitting is reusable so if it doesn't look right, you can redo it.

**First time?** Go slow, follow the steps, you'll be fine. We've all been there!

Questions on any of the steps?"

### Troubleshooting

**Q**: "My fitting is leaking at the hose, what did I do wrong?"

**A**: "Leak at the hose/fitting junction - let's diagnose:

**Most common causes**:

1. **Not tight enough** - Needs hand-tight + 1/4 turn with wrench
   - Check: Is the braided covering flush with the fitting collar?
   - Fix: Tighten another 1/8 turn, check if flush

2. **Nipple not fully seated** - Needs to insert until shoulder contacts hose
   - Check: Can you see a gap between nipple shoulder and hose?
   - Fix: Disassemble, push nipple in ALL the way, reassemble

3. **PTFE liner damaged** - Cut too short or nicked during assembly
   - Check: Look inside fitting for torn PTFE
   - Fix: Cut off 2", reassemble with fresh hose end

4. **Wrong size fitting** - AN-6 fitting on AN-8 hose (won't seal)
   - Check: Do the sizes match? (AN-6 hose = AN-6 fitting)
   - Fix: Get correct size fitting

Try tightening first (most common fix). If still leaking after getting it flush, probably need to remake that end.

Let me know what you find!"

### Technical Question

**Q**: "Why PTFE instead of regular fuel hose?"

**A**: "PTFE (Teflon) is the gold standard for performance fuel systems. Here's why:

**Chemical Resistance**:
- Rubber hose: Degrades with E85, swells with some fuels
- PTFE: Handles gasoline, E85, methanol, diesel - zero degradation

**Temperature**:
- Rubber: Usually 200-300°F max, gets soft when hot
- PTFE: 500-600°F, stays consistent

**Longevity**:
- Rubber: 5-10 years, then gets brittle
- PTFE: 20+ years, doesn't age

**Performance**:
- Rubber: Can expand under pressure (inconsistent flow)
- PTFE: Dimensionally stable, consistent flow

**For Hot Rods**:
- Engine bay heat
- E85 compatibility (common in performance builds)
- Want it done right once
- Professional appearance

PTFE costs more upfront but it's the last fuel line you'll buy for that car.

Plus the reusable fittings mean you can change routing if needed - try that with crimped rubber hose!

Makes sense for your build?"
