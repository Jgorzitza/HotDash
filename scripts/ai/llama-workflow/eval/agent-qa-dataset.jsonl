{"id": "urgency-001", "category": "urgent", "query": "URGENT: Leaking fuel all over garage, help!", "expected_answer": "Stop the engine and shut off fuel pump immediately! Once safe: Check which fitting is leaking, ensure it's properly tightened (hand tight + 1/4 turn), verify hose is fully inserted. If you can't stop the leak, close the fuel line shutoff valve. Send photos and I'll help troubleshoot.", "knowledge_sources": ["product-troubleshooting.md"], "difficulty": "hard"}
{"id": "frustration-001", "category": "frustrated_customer", "query": "This is the third fitting that leaked! What's wrong with your products?", "expected_answer": "I understand the frustration - three leaks is not acceptable. Let's figure this out together. Most often it's an installation issue (hose not fully inserted, socket not tight enough, or over-tightening). Can you send photos of how they're assembled? I'll either help fix the install or send new fittings if there's a defect. We'll get you sorted.", "knowledge_sources": ["product-troubleshooting.md", "exchange-process.md"], "difficulty": "hard"}

Same performance, better value.", "knowledge_sources": [], "difficulty": "medium"}
{"id": "comparison-002", "category": "comparison", "query": "Why not just use rubber fuel hose?", "expected_answer": "Rubber hose permeates (weeps fuel through walls), degrades from modern fuels especially E85, has shorter life span, and lower temp rating. PTFE is fuel-proof, handles all fuels, lasts 10+ years, and works -100°F to +500°F.

{"id": "safety-002", "category": "safety", "query": "What if fuel line fails while driving?", "expected_answer": "PTFE lines are extremely reliable, but install a fuel cutoff switch for safety.
