REASONING:
1. Speed to launch - Zero infrastructure setup, can deploy today
2. Lower risk - Managed service handles ClickHouse + MinIO + Redis
3. Cost effective - ~$50/month vs managing 3 additional services on Fly.io
4. Can migrate later - If we need self-hosted, can migrate after launch

IMPLEMENTATION:
- SPECIALAGENT001: Sign up for Langfuse Cloud
- Get API keys and configure in environment
- Wire LLM Gateway to Langfuse Cloud API
- Test with sample traces
- Deploy to production

MIGRATION PATH (if needed later):
- Export traces from Langfuse Cloud
- Deploy self-hosted Langfuse on Fly.io
- Import traces
- Switch API endpoint

TIMELINE: Can be done today, unblocks SPECIALAGENT001 immediately.`,
