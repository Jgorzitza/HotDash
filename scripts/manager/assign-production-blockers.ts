IMPACT: SPECIALAGENT001 blocked on LLM Gateway infrastructure.

OPTIONS:
1. Fly-native: Deploy ClickHouse + MinIO on Fly.io
   - Pros: Full control, no external dependencies
   - Cons: More infrastructure to manage
   
2. Langfuse Cloud: Use managed Langfuse service
   - Pros: Zero infrastructure, fast setup
   - Cons: Monthly cost, less control
   
3. Hybrid: Managed ClickHouse/MinIO + Fly Redis
   - Pros: Balance of control and convenience
   - Cons: Multiple vendors
