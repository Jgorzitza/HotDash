      "question": "How to implement Clean Up Console Logging? What are the steps and requirements?",
      "answer": "To implement clean-up console logging, you should follow these steps and requirements:\n1. **Log Shutdown with Self-Assessment**: At the end of your workday, you need to log your shutdown status using the `logDecision()` function. This includes providing a self-assessment of your work.\n   Example code snippet:\n   ```typescript\n   import { calculateSelfGradeAverage } from \"~/services/decisions.server\";\n   const grades = {\n     progress: 5, // 1-5: Progress vs DoD\n     evidence: 4, // 1-5: Evidence quality\n     alignment: 5, // 1-5: Followed North Star/Rules\n     toolDiscipline: 5, // 1-5: MCP-first, no guessing\n     communication: 4, // 1-5: Clear updates, timely blockers\n   };\n   await logDecision({\n     scope: \"build\",\n     actor: \"<your-actor>\", // Replace with your specific actor (e.g., support, product)\n     action: \"shutdown\",\n     status: \"in_progress\", // or 'completed' if all tasks done\n     progressPct: 75, // Overall daily progress\n     rationale: \"Daily shutdown - {X} tasks completed, {Y} in progress\",\n     durationActual: 6.5, // Total hours today\n     payload: {\n       dailySummary: \"{TASK-A} complete, {TASK-B} at 75%\",\n       selfGrade: {\n         ...grades,\n         average: calculateSelfGradeAverage(grades),\n       },\n       retrospective: {\n         didWell: [\"Used MCP first\", \"Good test coverage\"],\n         toChange: [\"Ask questions earlier\"],\n         toStop: \"Making assumptions\",\n       },\n       tasksCompleted: [\"{TASK-ID-A}\", \"{TASK-ID-B}\"],\n       hoursWorked: 6.5,\n     },\n   });\n   ```\n2. **Markdown Backup (Optional)**: You can also write detailed notes to a markdown file for your records, but this is not mandatory. The primary method of logging is through the database.\n3. **Immediate Logging**: Ensure that you log your progress immediately when tasks start, complete, or if you encounter blockers. This is crucial for real-time visibility to your manager and other agents.\n4. **Use of `logDecision()`**: This function is mandatory for all logging actions, including task completions and shutdowns. It ensures that your work is recorded in the database, which is the primary method for tracking progress.\n5. **Manager Visibility**: Your manager can query the database to see your status instantly, so ensure that your logs are accurate and timely.\nBy following these steps, you will maintain clean and structured logging, which is essential for effective communication and tracking within the team [Source 1][Source 2][Source 3][Source 4][Source 5][Source 7].",

      "question": "What are the best practices for engineer agent when working on Clean Up Console Logging?",
      "answer": "The best practices for engineers when working on cleaning up console logging include the following:\n1. **Log Progress Immediately**: Use the `logDecision()` function to log your progress as you work. This should be done immediately when the task status changes (e.g., when starting, completing, or encountering a blocker) and every two hours if the task is still in progress [Source 3].\n2. **Follow Tool-First Rule**: Always pull documentation and use the appropriate tools before writing any code. This ensures that you are following the latest guidelines and practices [Source 4].\n3. **Structured Logging**: Ensure that all logging is structured and follows the required format. This allows managers and other agents to see the status of tasks and any blockers in real-time [Source 5].\n4. **Avoid Console Logs**: When cleaning up, ensure that no sensitive information or unnecessary console logs are left in the code. Follow the protocol that prohibits freehand HTTP or secrets in logs [Source 3].\n5. **Document Evidence**: Create MCP Evidence JSONL files for any code changes made during the cleanup process. This is a new requirement for tracking changes and ensuring compliance [Source 4].\n6. **Complete Tasks Before Moving On**: Focus on completing the current task before starting a new one. This helps maintain clarity and ensures that all tasks are properly logged and documented [Source 2].\n7. **Communicate Blockers**: If you encounter any blockers, log them immediately and communicate with your manager to propose next steps. This ensures that issues are addressed promptly [Source 7].\nBy adhering to these practices, engineers can effectively manage the cleanup of console logging while maintaining compliance with operational protocols.",

      "question": "Common issues and solutions when implementing Clean Up Console Logging",
      "answer": "Common issues and solutions when implementing Clean Up Console Logging include:\n1. **Improper Logging Structure**:\n   - **Issue**: Logs may not follow the required structured format, making it difficult for the Manager to track progress.\n   - **Solution**: Ensure that all logging uses the `logDecision()` method with the correct parameters, including status updates (e.g., 'in_progress', 'completed', 'blocked') and relevant metadata [Source 1].\n2. **Delayed Logging**:\n   - **Issue**: Logging status changes only at the 2-hour interval can lead to a lack of real-time visibility for the Manager.\n   - **Solution**: Log status changes immediately for critical updates (e.g., when a task is started, completed, or blocked) to provide timely information [Source 1].\n3. **Failure to Signal Manager**:\n   - **Issue**: Not using the `logDecision()` call can result in the Manager not being informed of the current status.\n   - **Solution**: Always use `logDecision()` for status updates, as it automatically signals the Manager and updates their visibility into your work [Source 2].\n4. **Markdown Files for Logging**:\n   - **Issue**: Relying on markdown files for logging can lead to missed updates and lack of visibility.\n   - **Solution**: Use the database logging method exclusively via `logDecision()`, as it ensures that the Manager can access the latest status quickly [Source 1].\n5. **Local Environment Cleanup**:\n   - **Issue**: Failing to clean up local environments (e.g., leaving terminals open or `.env` files staged) can lead to security risks.\n   - **Solution**: Follow the local clean-up checklist to close terminals and ensure sensitive files are not staged before shutdown [Source 2].\n6. **Blocked Tasks Not Logged**:\n   - **Issue**: Not logging when a task is blocked can prevent the Manager from understanding the workflow's status.\n   - **Solution**: Use the `logDecision()` method to log blocked tasks, including details about the blocker and the task ID that is causing the blockage [Source 10].\nBy addressing these common issues with the outlined solutions, the implementation of Clean Up Console Logging can be more effective and aligned with the team's operational standards.",
