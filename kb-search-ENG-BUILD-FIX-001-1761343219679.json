      "answer": "To implement the \"Fix Build Failures\" task involving `package.json` and `analytics.ts`, follow these steps and requirements:\n### Steps to Implement\n1. **Git Setup**:\n   - Navigate to the project directory and ensure you are on the correct branch:\n     ```bash\n     cd /home/justin/HotDash/hot-dash\n     git fetch origin\n     git checkout manager-reopen-20251021\n     git pull origin manager-reopen-20251021\n     ```\n2. **Implement Action Attribution Service**:\n   - Create a new service file `app/services/analytics/action-attribution.ts`.\n   - Implement the GA4 Data API query to track action ROI and re-rank the action queue.\n   - Ensure the custom dimension `hd_action_key` is created in GA4 (this is a prerequisite).\n3. **Update `package.json`**:\n   - Ensure that all necessary dependencies for the analytics service are included in `package.json`. This may involve adding packages related to Google Analytics and any other required libraries.\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Write unit tests for the new service to ensure it functions correctly.\n   - Mock Google Analytics Data API responses for testing purposes.\n   - Test for rate limiting (1 request per second) to comply with GA4 API limits.\n5. **Progress Reporting**:\n   - Use the `logDecision()` function to report progress every 2 hours or at task milestones. This includes:\n     - Starting the task\n     - Providing updates on progress\n     - Marking the task as completed with relevant details.\n### Requirements\n- **Dependencies**: Ensure that the GA4 custom dimension `hd_action_key` is created by DevOps before starting the implementation.\n- **MCP Evidence**: Log every MCP call in the required JSONL format.\n- **Heartbeat NDJSON**: Append to the heartbeat file every 15 minutes for tasks exceeding 2 hours.\n- **Testing**: Ensure all unit tests pass and that the implementation adheres to the coding standards (e.g., using `Response.json()` instead of `json()`).\n### Additional Notes\n- Follow the execution order strictly, starting with the Action Attribution Service (ANALYTICS-017) and then proceeding to the Search Console Storage (ANALYTICS-018).\n- Ensure that you document any blockers or questions in the feedback files as specified.\nBy following these steps and meeting the outlined requirements, you will be able to successfully implement the necessary fixes for build failures related to `package.json` and `analytics.ts`.",

      "question": "What are the best practices for engineer agent when working on Fix Build Failures (package.json + analytics.ts)?",
      "answer": "The best practices for an engineer agent working on fixing build failures related to `package.json` and `analytics.ts` include the following steps:\n1. **Immediate Start**: Begin working immediately after completing the startup checklist. Do not wait for manager approval or report readiness to start [Source 1].\n2. **Log Progress**: Use `logDecision()` to log your progress as you work. This should be done at least every two hours or at task milestones [Source 11].\n3. **Follow Development Workflow**: Ensure that all tasks are molecule-sized (≤ 2 days) and that issues are created for all work. Adhere to the branching model and commit style guidelines [Source 2].\n4. **Use MCP Tools**: Always pull Context7 MCP documentation before starting any task. This is mandatory for all development work [Source 10]. Ensure that you log every MCP call in the designated JSONL files [Source 7].\n5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request. This includes unit tests for any new features or fixes [Source 12].\n6. **Evidence and Reporting**: Maintain a record of evidence for all changes made, including MCP Evidence JSONL files and heartbeat NDJSON files for tasks that exceed two hours [Source 10]. \n7. **React Router Compliance**: When working with React Router, ensure to use `Response.json()` instead of `json()` to avoid violations [Source 12].\n8. **Escalate Blockers**: If you encounter any blockers that prevent progress for more than 10 minutes, log the issue with exact error/output and mention the manager in the relevant issue [Source 1].\nBy adhering to these practices, the engineer agent can effectively address build failures and contribute to the project's success.",

      "question": "UI component implementation and design patterns",
      "answer": "The implementation and design patterns for the UI components, specifically the CX Escalation Modal and the PII Card, follow a structured approach that emphasizes accessibility, visual design, and functional requirements.\n### CX Escalation Modal Integration\n1. **UI Layout**:\n   - The modal features a split layout with two sections: Public Reply and PII Card, ensuring clear visual separation and hierarchy. On mobile devices, the layout stacks vertically.\n2. **Public Reply Section**:\n   - Contains a draft reply text area, displays redacted customer data, and includes prominent approve/reject buttons. A preview of the customer view is also provided.\n3. **PII Card Section**:\n   - Displays full customer details with a warning banner indicating that this information is operator-only and not sent to the customer. The section includes all necessary customer details and is designed with accessibility in mind.\n4. **Validation Logic**:\n   - Implements validation to prevent unmasked PII from being included in public replies, with clear error messages and disabled buttons when validation fails.\n5. **Accessibility**:\n   - Focus management, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and labels are all considered to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.\n### PII Card Component\n1. **Design Requirements**:\n   - The PII Card is designed using Polaris components, including a warning banner, sections for order details, customer contact, shipping address, tracking information, and line items displayed in a responsive DataTable.\n2. **Accessibility Features**:\n   - The component includes ARIA labels for screen readers, ensuring that all interactive elements are accessible. The color contrast meets WCAG AA standards.\n3. **Masking Functions**:\n   - Functions are implemented to mask sensitive information such as email, phone, address, and order ID, ensuring that only necessary information is displayed while maintaining privacy.\n4. **Testing and Validation**:\n   - Unit tests are conducted to ensure that all components render correctly and that masking functions work as intended, with no full PII being exposed in outputs.\n### Conclusion\nThe implementation of these UI components adheres to a comprehensive design pattern that prioritizes user experience, accessibility, and security. The use of Polaris components and adherence to WCAG standards ensures that the application is both functional and inclusive for all users.",

      "question": "How does Fix Build Failures (package.json + analytics.ts) integrate with the Growth Engine architecture?",
      "answer": "The integration of \"Fix Build Failures\" (package.json + analytics.ts) with the Growth Engine architecture is part of the broader effort to enhance the analytics capabilities within the Growth Engine framework. This integration is aligned with the completion of various analytics tasks, which include social, SEO, ads, and growth metrics, as well as the implementation of features such as CSV exports, multi-project aggregation, trend forecasting, and anomaly detection.\nThe Growth Engine architecture, effective from October 21, 2025, emphasizes security and evidence requirements for continuous integration (CI) processes. Specifically, it mandates the inclusion of MCP Evidence JSONL files and Heartbeat NDJSON files in pull requests (PRs) to ensure compliance with the new standards. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the analytics data and ensuring that all changes are properly documented and validated before merging into the main codebase [Source 1][Source 2].\nAdditionally, the integration of analytics components like analytics.ts is designed to support the orchestration of various agents within the Growth Engine, including specialist agents that run in the background to keep data fresh and provide insights. This orchestration model is essential for enabling real-time analytics and reporting, which are key features of the Growth Engine [Source 2][Source 6].\nIn summary, the \"Fix Build Failures\" initiative contributes to the Growth Engine architecture by enhancing analytics capabilities, ensuring compliance with security and evidence requirements, and supporting the overall orchestration of agents that drive data-driven decision-making within the system.",
