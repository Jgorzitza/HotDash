      "answer": "To implement the Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init, follow these steps and requirements:\n### Steps:\n1. **Coordinate Migration Strategy**:\n   - Address the Supabase migration history mismatch by coordinating with the Manager and Data agent. Choose a strategy to either pull the remote schema, repair migration history, or manually reconcile the migrations [Source 1].\n2. **Configure Secrets**:\n   - Ensure that the required secrets for Supabase and other services are configured in GitHub Secrets. There are 15 secrets needed, including 5 for Supabase [Source 1].\n3. **Daily Branch Setup**:\n   - Make sure you are working on the correct daily branch as announced by the Manager. Fetch the latest changes and check out the current branch [Source 4][Source 10].\n4. **MCP Tools Verification**:\n   - Verify that you have the necessary MCP tools set up before writing any code. This includes ensuring that you are using the correct APIs and libraries [Source 4].\n5. **Implement Changes**:\n   - Make the necessary code changes for the AccountsSubAgent. Follow the conventional commit style for your changes, ensuring to include the agent name in the commit message [Source 6].\n6. **Testing and Validation**:\n   - Run the required tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to ensure that your changes work as expected. Use the commands provided to format, lint, and test your code [Source 6].\n7. **Pull Request Creation**:\n   - Create a pull request with a clear objective, linked task ID, and updated documentation as necessary. Ensure that all checks pass before merging [Source 6].\n### Requirements:\n- **Migration Coordination**: You must resolve the migration history mismatch before proceeding with any database changes [Source 1].\n- **Secrets Configuration**: All required secrets must be configured to test workflows that depend on them [Source 1].\n- **Daily Branch**: All agents must work on the same daily branch coordinated by the Manager [Source 10].\n- **MCP Tools**: Ensure that you have the correct MCP tools for development [Source 4].\n- **Testing**: All changes must be tested and validated before merging into the main branch [Source 6].\nBy following these steps and ensuring all requirements are met, you can successfully implement the Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init.",

      "question": "What are the best practices for engineer agent when working on Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init?",
      "answer": "The best practices for engineers working on the Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init include:\n1. **Follow the Operating Model**: Adhere to the guidelines outlined in the operating model, particularly regarding agent orchestration and the roles of different agents. Ensure that the Accounts Sub-Agent is utilized correctly for order lookups, refunds, and exchanges, while the Storefront Sub-Agent handles inventory queries and product details [Source 1][Source 2].\n2. **Use the MCP Tools**: Always pull documentation from the MCP tools before writing any code. Prioritize using the Shopify Dev MCP for Polaris and Shopify APIs, and refer to other MCPs as needed [Source 7].\n3. **Log Progress**: As you work on tasks, log your progress immediately using the `logDecision()` function. This helps maintain transparency and allows for better tracking of work done [Source 4].\n4. **Start Working Immediately**: After completing the startup checklist, begin working on your assigned tasks without waiting for approval. This includes implementing features and moving on to the next task as soon as one is completed [Source 4].\n5. **Coordinate with Other Agents**: Ensure proper coordination with other agents, especially when dependencies exist. For example, data tables must be completed before starting inventory or integration tasks [Source 3][Source 11].\n6. **Maintain Quality Gates**: Ensure that all work passes through quality gates, including validation by designers and proper testing of functionalities before moving to the next phase [Source 6].\n7. **Handle Blockers Promptly**: If you encounter any blockers, log them immediately and escalate if they persist for more than 10 minutes. This ensures that issues are addressed quickly and do not hinder progress [Source 4].\n8. **Follow the Handoff Pattern**: Adhere to the established handoff pattern for agent interactions, ensuring that requests are properly triaged and handled by the appropriate sub-agent [Source 11].\nBy following these best practices, engineers can effectively contribute to the development and maintenance of the Fix AccountsSubAgent Module while ensuring compliance with the overall operational framework.",

      "question": "Common issues and solutions when implementing Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init",
      "answer": "When implementing the Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init, you may encounter several common issues along with their respective solutions:\n1. **Supabase Migration History Mismatch (CRITICAL)**:\n   - **Issue**: There is a discrepancy between the migrations on the remote and local directories, with remote having 53 migrations not present locally and vice versa.\n   - **Impact**: This mismatch prevents safe pushing of migrations to the staging database.\n   - **Required Action**: Coordination between the Manager and Data agent is necessary to devise a migration strategy.\n   - **Options**:\n     - Pull the remote schema (safer option).\n     - Repair the migration history (riskier).\n     - Manual reconciliation (safest but time-consuming) [Source 1].\n2. **Secrets Configuration Pending (MEDIUM)**:\n   - **Issue**: There are 15 secrets that need to be configured, which include secrets for Supabase, Publer, Shopify, Notifications, and Fly.io.\n   - **Impact**: Workflows that require these secrets cannot be tested.\n   - **Required Action**: The Manager must configure the GitHub Secrets.\n   - **Status**: A verification script is ready to assist with this configuration [Source 1].\n3. **GitHub Actions Billing Issue (CRITICAL)**:\n   - **Issue**: A billing issue with GitHub Actions is blocking CI/CD processes, staging deployment, and branch protection.\n   - **Impact**: This issue can halt progress on the project.\n   - **Required Action**: The Manager needs to address this issue promptly [Source 9].\n4. **Data Migrations Must Be Applied**:\n   - **Issue**: Certain phases of development are blocked until the necessary data migrations are applied.\n   - **Impact**: This can delay the implementation of features that depend on these migrations.\n   - **Required Action**: Ensure that all required migrations are applied before proceeding with dependent tasks [Source 12].\nBy addressing these issues with the outlined solutions, you can facilitate a smoother implementation of the Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init.",

      "answer": "The integration of the Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init within the Growth Engine architecture is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources. However, it can be inferred that the Accounts Sub-Agent plays a critical role in the Growth Engine's agent orchestration model. This sub-agent is responsible for handling customer account-related tasks such as order lookups, refunds, and exchanges, utilizing the Customer Accounts API with write access [Source 1].\nThe Growth Engine architecture emphasizes an interactive agent model where sub-agents, including the Accounts Sub-Agent, own requests and execute necessary queries (like Shopify GraphQL) to return structured data. This data is then processed and redacted by the front-end agents before being sent to the customer, ensuring compliance with privacy standards [Source 11].\nFor a more specific understanding of how the Fix AccountsSubAgent Module-Scope Supabase Init integrates with the Growth Engine, additional details or documentation would be required, as the current sources do not provide that information directly.",
