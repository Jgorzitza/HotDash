# Template Specs (Liquid/JSON)

## Page Layout
- Headline with model/engine context
- Compatibility table (facts pulled from metaobjects)
- Product blocks with availability and returns/shipping excerpts
- How-to snippets (steps, tools)
- FAQ/Q&A extracted from chat (curated)

## Internal Linking
- Up-links to the hub (AN Hose 101).
- Side-links to related PDPs and adjacent guides.
- Anchor text mirrors user queries and synonyms (e.g., `-6AN`, `AN6`).

## Performance
- Images: â‰¤150 KB for hero; responsive sizes; lazy-load galleries.
- Defer non-critical scripts; no layout shift on product price blocks.
