      "question": "How to implement Dark Mode Implementation? What are the steps and requirements?",
      "answer": "To implement Dark Mode in the HotDash application, follow these steps and requirements:\n1. **Design Specifications**: Ensure that the Dark Mode implementation adheres to the design specifications outlined in the design library located at `/docs/design/`. This includes matching the visual elements and interactions as specified in the 57 design files.\n2. **Settings Page Integration**:\n   - Add a theme selector in the Appearance tab of the Settings page, allowing users to choose between Light, Dark, and Auto themes.\n   - Ensure that the selected theme is applied to the root element of the application and persists to the database for user preferences.\n3. **Accessibility Compliance**: Verify that the Dark Mode implementation complies with WCAG 2.2 AA standards. This includes checking color contrast ratios to ensure readability and usability for all users.\n4. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the Dark Mode functions correctly across different devices and screen sizes. Use Chrome DevTools for responsive testing and accessibility audits.\n5. **Designer Validation**: Obtain sign-off from the designer to confirm that the Dark Mode matches the design specifications and meets accessibility requirements.\n6. **Documentation and Evidence**: Document the implementation process and gather evidence of compliance with design specs and accessibility standards. This includes screenshots and validation documents.\n7. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure that all quality gates are met, including passing accessibility tests and performance benchmarks.\n8. **Governance**: Link issues related to the Dark Mode implementation and ensure that all CI checks are green before merging the changes.\nBy following these steps, you can successfully implement Dark Mode in the HotDash application while adhering to the required standards and specifications [Source 1][Source 4][Source 5][Source 6].",

      "question": "What are the best practices for engineer agent when working on Dark Mode Implementation?",
      "answer": "The best practices for engineers when working on Dark Mode implementation include:\n1. **Implement a Dark Color Palette**: Ensure that a suitable dark color palette is designed and integrated into the application.\n2. **Theme Toggle in Settings**: Provide a toggle option in the settings to allow users to switch between Light and Dark modes. This feature should already be in place as part of Phase 6.\n3. **Persist User Preferences**: Make sure that the user's theme preference (Light/Dark/Auto) is saved and persists across sessions, which involves updating the user_preferences table in the database.\n4. **WCAG AA Contrast Verification**: Conduct thorough checks to ensure that the color contrast in Dark Mode meets the WCAG AA standards for accessibility. This is crucial for ensuring that all users can comfortably use the application regardless of their visual abilities [Source 2][Source 10].\n5. **Testing and Validation**: After implementation, the Dark Mode feature should be validated by designers and QA to ensure it meets design specifications and accessibility standards [Source 10].\nBy following these practices, engineers can effectively implement Dark Mode while ensuring a good user experience and compliance with accessibility standards.",

      "question": "Common issues and solutions when implementing Dark Mode Implementation",
      "answer": "Common issues and solutions when implementing Dark Mode include:\n1. **Color Contrast**: Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors is crucial for readability. Use tools to check color contrast ratios against WCAG guidelines.\n2. **Visual Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent visual design across different components in both light and dark modes can be challenging. Utilize design tokens to ensure uniformity in colors and styles.\n3. **User Preferences**: Allowing users to select their preferred theme (Light/Dark/Auto) and ensuring that this preference persists across sessions is essential. Implement a theme selector in the settings page and save user preferences in the database.\n4. **Accessibility**: Dark mode should comply with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.2 AA). This includes ensuring that all elements are navigable via keyboard and screen readers can accurately announce content.\n5. **Testing Across Devices**: Dark mode should be tested on various devices and screen sizes to ensure a responsive design. Use responsive breakpoints and conduct thorough user acceptance testing (UAT).\n6. **Performance**: Dark mode implementations can sometimes lead to performance issues if not optimized. Monitor performance benchmarks and optimize rendering where necessary.\nThese issues and solutions are derived from best practices in UI/UX design and accessibility standards, as indicated in the project documentation [Source 1][Source 2][Source 6].",

      "question": "How does Dark Mode Implementation integrate with the Growth Engine architecture?",
      "answer": "The integration of Dark Mode Implementation with the Growth Engine architecture is part of Phase 6, which focuses on \"Settings & Personalization.\" This phase includes features such as drag and drop functionality, theme settings (which would encompass Dark Mode), and tile visibility options. The completion of this phase is essential for enhancing user experience through personalization features, including the ability to switch to Dark Mode [Source 1]. \nHowever, specific details on how Dark Mode is technically implemented within the Growth Engine architecture are not provided in the available sources. Thus, while we know it is part of the personalization features, the exact integration mechanics remain unspecified.",
