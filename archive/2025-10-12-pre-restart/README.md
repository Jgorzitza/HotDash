# Archive: 2025-10-12 Pre-Restart Cleanup

**Archived**: 2025-10-12  
**Reason**: Pre-restart cleanup - creating fresh direction/feedback files for all agents

## What's Archived

**Direction Files** (`directions/`):
- All 18+ agent direction files as of 2025-10-12
- Includes completed tasks, paused tasks, expanded task lists
- Preserved for historical reference

**Feedback Files** (`feedback/`):
- All agent feedback logs as of 2025-10-12
- Includes performance reviews, self-assessments, comprehensive updates
- Complete session history preserved

## Why Archive?

**Problem**: Direction and feedback files had grown very large (some 483+ lines) with:
- Completed tasks still listed
- Paused tasks marked "execute"
- Multiple expansions (2x, 5x, 10x)
- Outdated documentation confusing agents
- Hard to find current, active tasks

**Solution**: Fresh start with clean, focused direction files (10-15 launch-critical tasks only)

## How to Reference

If agents or Manager need historical context:
- Archived direction: `archive/2025-10-12-pre-restart/directions/{agent}.md`
- Archived feedback: `archive/2025-10-12-pre-restart/feedback/{agent}.md`

**Note**: Active direction is ALWAYS in `docs/directions/{agent}.md` (not archive)

## What's Different Post-Archive

**New Direction Files**:
- Non-negotiables at top (6 iron rules)
- Focused task lists (10-15 launch-critical tasks max)
- Clean structure (no completed/paused tasks)
- Git workflow embedded
- Standardized shutdown/startup processes

**New Feedback Files**:
- Fresh start from 2025-10-12
- Links to archive for historical context
- Clean logging going forward
