- Notes: Created artifact scaffolding at artifacts/{deploy,integrations,audits,tmp}. All outputs captured for evidence; no secrets printed.

## 2025-10-11T01:52:18Z â€” Task 1 partial attempt + blocker escalation
- Attempt: Local verification (Supabase status, env export, npm run setup, prisma status)
- Outcome: Command session aborted (exit 130). Avoiding further retries to prevent loops.
- Evidence:
  - Planned logs (some may be empty due to abort):
    - artifacts/deploy/supabase-status-20251011T015218Z.log
    - artifacts/deploy/npm-setup-20251011T015218Z.log
    - artifacts/deploy/prisma-migrate-status-20251011T015218Z.log
- Blocker: Terminal session interruption prevented completing npm run setup and prisma checks.
- Escalation to Manager: Request guidance on proceeding with Task 1 verification under current terminal constraints. I will resume once an uninterrupted window is confirmed.

## 2025-10-11T02:00:56Z â€” Task 2 Sanitized history (Complete)
- Commands executed:
  - git --no-pager fetch --all --prune â†’ artifacts/deploy/git-fetch-20251011T012241Z.log
  - git --no-pager grep -nE 'postgresql://|postgres://' â†’ artifacts/deploy/dsn-grep-20251011T012241Z.log
- Result summary: Only canonical placeholder DSNs found in docs/feedback/README areas; no live Supabase DSNs detected in source code. See log for matched lines.
- Next: Proceeding to Task 3 (Runbook parity) review without modifying manager-owned direction docs. Capturing any required doc/script diffs separately via PR if needed.

## 2025-10-11T02:02:00Z â€” Task 3 Runbook parity review
- Files reviewed (read-only):
  - scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh
  - docs/deployment/env_matrix.md
  - docs/deployment/chatwoot_fly_runbook.md
- Findings:
  - Staging deploy script auto-sources vault bundles and promotes env for non-interactive Shopify CLI deploys; smoke and artifacts are captured. No Fly Postgres references detected.
  - Env matrix aligns with Supabase session pooler and sslmode=require; secret names match staging workflow inputs.
  - Chatwoot Fly runbook specifies Supabase DSN with sslmode=require and Upstash Redis; includes bootstrap and smoke steps. Alignment looks correct.
- Action: No file changes proposed. Marking Task 3 review as completed; moving to Task 4 next (secrets mirroring) when ready to execute.

## 2025-10-11T07:13:59Z â€” Overnight task execution (per docs/directions/overnight/2025-10-11.md)
- Context: Manager added overnight execution plan with auto-run enabled. Executed deployment-specific tasks.
- Completed tasks:
  1. Env matrix parity check (read-only)
    - Command: `grep -nE "SUPABASE_|SHOPIFY_|CHATWOOT_" docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`
    - Output: artifacts/deployment/20251011T071410Z/env-matrix-grep.txt
  2. Runbook parity sweep (no edits)
    - Command: `rg -n "Supabase|sslmode=require|Upstash|session token" docs/deployment/`
    - Output: artifacts/deployment/20251011T071410Z/runbook-parity.txt
  3. Secret mirroring command plan (do not execute)
    - Drafted gh secret set commands with placeholders (Supabase DSN, Chatwoot Redis/API, GA MCP bundles)
    - Plan: artifacts/deployment/20251011T071448Z/gh-secrets-plan.md
    - Note: Per manager update, embed/session tokens excluded from mirroring plan
  4. Fly memory scaling plan (do not execute)
    - Generated scaling commands for 2GB Chatwoot web/worker and machines
    - Plan: artifacts/deployment/20251011T071508Z/fly-memory-plan.md
    - Both CLI commands and fly.toml options documented for morning review
- Next steps: await morning review of plans before executing scaling or mirroring.

## 2025-10-11T14:13:42Z â€” ðŸš¨ URGENT: GA MCP HTTP Server Destruction (Complete)
- **Context**: Destroyed unused `hotdash-analytics-mcp` Fly.io app per manager priority 1 task
- **Rationale**: 
  - Cursor uses local stdio GA MCP (working perfectly)
  - HotDash app will use Direct Google Analytics API (not MCP)
  - Server was suspended but still billable (~$4-6/month)
  - No functionality depends on this server
  - Cost savings: $50-70/year
- **Commands executed**:
  1. Status check: `~/.fly/bin/fly status -a hotdash-analytics-mcp`
     - Result: App existed, state=stopped, 1 machine in ord region
  2. Destruction: `~/.fly/bin/fly apps destroy hotdash-analytics-mcp --yes`
     - Result: âœ… "Destroyed app hotdash-analytics-mcp"
  3. Verification: `~/.fly/bin/fly apps list | grep analytics`
     - Result: âœ… No output (exit code 1), app completely removed
- **Evidence path**: Command outputs logged inline (no artifacts directory created per local policy)
- **Credential source**: vault/occ/fly/api_token.env
- **References**: 
  - Direction: docs/directions/deployment.md (lines 46-74)
  - Context: GoogleMCP-FINAL-PROJECT-SUMMARY.md (lines 318-338)
  - Timeline: Completed within 24-hour requirement
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Server destroyed, verified gone, cost savings active
