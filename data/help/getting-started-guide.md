## üì¶ Inventory Management

### Key Concepts

- AI calculates based on sales velocity and lead time

**Safety Stock**

- Accounts for demand variability

**EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)**
- Optimal order quantity to minimize costs
- Balances ordering costs vs. holding costs

### Inventory Alerts
- **Low Stock** - Below reorder point
- **Out of Stock** - Zero inventory
- **Overstock** - Excess inventory (slow-moving)
- **Reorder Recommended** - AI suggests purchase order

### Approving Purchase Orders
1. Review AI recommendation
2. Check:
   - Quantity makes sense
   - Supplier is correct
   - Lead time is accurate
   - Budget allows
3. Approve or adjust quantity
