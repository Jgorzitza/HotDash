---

**Meaning:** Package moving through carrier network

**What's Happening:**

### Unusual Tracking Patterns

- Tracking not updating (package still moving)

**Action:**
- Wait 7 days total
- Then contact carrier for investigation
- Contact us - we'll open carrier case
- We'll send replacement if not resolved in 10 days

#### Multiple Delivery Attempts

**Status:** Shows 2+ delivery attempts

**Why:**

**Solutions:**
- Pick up at carrier facility
- Sign online for "authority to leave"
