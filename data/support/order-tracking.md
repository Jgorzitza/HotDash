## Tracking FAQs

**Q: Why does my tracking say "Label Created" but hasn't moved?**  
A: Carrier has received shipping information but hasn't picked up package yet. Usually picks up within 24 hours.

**Q: Can I change delivery address after shipping?**  
A: Possibly. Contact carrier directly ASAP. Some carriers offer "delivery intercept" service (fees may apply).

**Q: My tracking says "Exception" - what does that mean?**  
A: Unexpected event (weather, address issue, etc.). Usually resolved within 1-2 days. Contact carrier if concerned.

**Q: Can I pick up my package instead of waiting for delivery?**  
A: Yes. Contact carrier after first delivery attempt to arrange hold for pickup at local facility.

**Q: How accurate are the estimated delivery dates?**  
A: Usually very accurate, but not guaranteed. Weather, carrier delays, or high volume can affect dates.

**Q: My package shows delivered to wrong city - what happened?**  
A: Usually a carrier scanning error. Package often arrives at correct address. Wait 24-48 hours or contact carrier.
