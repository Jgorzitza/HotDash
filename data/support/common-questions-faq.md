## Product Selection

### Q6: What size AN hose do I need for my application?
**A:** It depends on your horsepower and fuel system:
- **400-600 HP (NA):** AN-6 supply, AN-6 return
- **600+ HP (NA):** AN-8 supply, AN-6 return
- **Turbo/Supercharged:** AN-8 supply minimum
- **800+ HP:** AN-10 supply, AN-8 return

For specific recommendations, email your engine specs to support@hotrodan.com

---

### Q7: What's the difference between nylon braided and stainless braided hose?
**A:**
- **Nylon Braided:** Lighter weight, more flexible, easier to route, comes in multiple colors, slightly less durable to abrasion
- **Stainless Braided:** Heavier, more rigid, maximum abrasion resistance, show-quality appearance, silver only

Both have the same PTFE inner liner and performance. Choose based on your preferences and application!

---

### Q8: What do the numbers mean? (AN-6, AN-8, AN-10)
**A:** AN sizes refer to the dash size:
- **AN-6:** 6/16" or 3/8" inner diameter
- **AN-8:** 8/16" or 1/2" inner diameter  
- **AN-10:** 10/16" or 5/8" inner diameter

Higher number = larger hose = more fuel flow capacity

---

### Q9: Can I mix and match hose colors?
**A:** Absolutely! Many customers use different colors to identify different lines:
- Red = fuel supply
- Blue = fuel return
- Black = general purpose
- Purple/Yellow/Green = personal preference or system identification

---

### Q10: What fittings do I need for my hose?
**A:** For each hose end, you need:
1. **Hose end fitting** (straight, 45째, or 90째) - attaches to hose
2. **Adapter fitting** (if needed) - connects hose end to your component

Check your component port type (AN, NPT, ORB, etc.) and order matching adapters. Our bundle deals include hose + 8 fittings for complete setups!

---

### Q11: What's the difference between reusable and push-on fittings?
**A:** All our PTFE hose fittings are **reusable**:
- Can be removed and reinstalled multiple times
- Require proper assembly with ferrule
- More labor-intensive but better long-term value
- Professional-grade quality

We don't carry push-on fittings as they're not compatible with PTFE hose.

---

## Installation & Technical

### Q12: Do I need special tools to install AN fittings?
**A:** Helpful but not always required:
- **Essential:** Sharp AN hose cutting shears (Part #: HRA-CUT-001)
- **Recommended:** Adjustable spanner wrench (Part #: HRA-WRENCH)
- **Optional:** Vice jaws (Part #: HRA-VICE) for easier assembly
- **Not needed:** Thread sealant (AN fittings use flare seal, not threads)

Many customers successfully install with just the cutting shears and standard wrenches.

---

### Q13: Do I use thread sealant on AN fittings?
**A:** **NO!** Never use thread sealant (Teflon tape, pipe dope, etc.) on AN fittings. They use a **flare seal** design, not a thread seal. Using sealant can cause leaks and damage.

**DO use sealant on:**
- NPT fittings (tapered pipe threads)
- Not on AN (straight threads with flare)

---

### Q14: How tight should I make AN fittings?
**A:** Torque specifications:
- **AN-6:** 25-30 ft-lbs
- **AN-8:** 30-35 ft-lbs
- **AN-10:** 35-40 ft-lbs

Assembly tip: Hand-tighten until snug, then use wrench to turn an additional 1/4 to 1/2 turn. Do NOT over-tighten!

---

### Q15: My fitting is leaking - what should I do?
**A:** Check these common causes:
1. **Under-torqued:** Tighten to proper torque spec
2. **Over-torqued:** Disassemble, inspect for damage, reassemble
3. **Cross-threaded:** Disassemble, start threads by hand carefully
4. **Missing O-ring:** For ORB fittings, check O-ring is present and lubricated
5. **Damaged flare:** Inspect hose end for damage

See our [Product Troubleshooting Guide](product-troubleshooting.md) for detailed help.

---

### Q16: Can I cut the hose to custom length?
**A:** Yes! Our hose is sold by the foot and you can cut it to any length you need. 

**Important:**
- Use proper AN hose cutting shears (never a knife or regular scissors)
- Cut straight across, not at an angle
- Custom-cut hose cannot be returned (safety policy)

**Tip:** Measure carefully and add 2-3 inches extra for fitting installation.

---

### Q17: What's the minimum bend radius for PTFE hose?
**A:**
- **AN-6:** 2.5" minimum bend radius
- **AN-8:** 3.0" minimum bend radius
- **AN-10:** 3.5" minimum bend radius

Going below minimum radius will kink the hose and restrict flow. Use 45째 or 90째 fittings to avoid sharp bends!

---

### Q18: Will PTFE hose work with E85 fuel?
**A:** Yes! PTFE (Teflon) is **100% compatible** with:
- E85 and ethanol fuels
- Gasoline (all grades)
- Diesel
- Methanol
- Most racing fuels

PTFE is the gold standard for fuel system compatibility.

---

### Q19: Can I use this hose for brake lines, transmission coolers, or other applications?
**A:** While PTFE hose CAN be used for many applications, we specifically recommend and sell it for **fuel systems**. 

For other applications:
- **Brake lines:** Use DOT-approved brake line
- **Transmission:** Our hose works but check temperature ratings
- **Power steering:** Usually fine but verify pressure ratings
- **Coolant:** Not recommended (too hot for braided hose comfort)

Contact us if you have a specific non-fuel application question.
