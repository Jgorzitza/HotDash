## PTFE Hose Issues

### Issue: Hose is Kinked or Bent
**Symptoms:** Reduced flow, visible kink in hose line  
**Causes:**
- Bent beyond minimum bend radius
- Improper routing
- Hose too short for application

**Solutions:**
1. Check minimum bend radius for your hose size:
   - AN-6: 2.5" minimum
   - AN-8: 3.0" minimum
   - AN-10: 3.5" minimum
2. Use 45° or 90° fittings to avoid sharp bends
3. Order longer hose if needed
4. Replace kinked hose (do not attempt to straighten)

**Prevention:** Plan routing before cutting hose, use angled fittings

---

### Issue: Hose End is Frayed or Damaged
**Symptoms:** Loose braiding, exposed inner liner, difficult fitting assembly

**Causes:**
- Cut with wrong tool
- Dull cutting blade
- Too much force during cutting

**Solutions:**
1. Use proper AN hose cutting shears (Hot Rod AN Part #: HRA-CUT-001)
2. Make clean, straight cuts
3. Trim away any loose braiding with sharp scissors
4. If inner PTFE liner is damaged, cut 1/2" off and retry

**Prevention:** Always use sharp, proper cutting tools designed for braided hose

---

### Issue: Hose is Stiff or Hard to Route
**Symptoms:** Difficult to bend, resists installation

**Causes:**
- Cold temperature (PTFE becomes stiffer)
- Brand new hose (not broken in)

**Solutions:**
1. Warm hose to room temperature before installation
2. Gently flex hose back and forth to increase flexibility
3. Use heat gun on LOW setting (max 150°F) for 30 seconds if needed
4. Consider using nylon braided hose instead of stainless for tighter bends

**Note:** PTFE hose stiffness is normal and does not affect performance

## AN Fitting Problems

### Issue: Fitting Won't Thread onto Hose End
**Symptoms:** Fitting stops before fully engaging, cross-threading

**Causes:**
- Fitting and hose sizes don't match
- Ferrule not seated properly
- Cross-threaded during initial assembly
- Wrong fitting type (ORB vs. AN)

**Solutions:**
1. Verify sizes match:
   - AN-6 hose = AN-6 fittings
   - AN-8 hose = AN-8 fittings
   - AN-10 hose = AN-10 fittings
2. Ensure ferrule is pushed all the way onto hose
3. Start threads by hand - never force with wrench
4. Check for cross-threading - back out and restart
5. Use proper assembly technique (see installation guide)

**Prevention:** Double-check part numbers before installation, thread by hand first

---

### Issue: Fitting Leaks After Installation
**Symptoms:** Fuel/fluid dripping from fitting connection

**Causes:**
- Under-torqued fitting
- Over-torqued fitting (damaged threads or seal)
- Missing or damaged O-ring (ORB fittings)
- Improper assembly
- Thread sealant used where not needed

**Solutions:**
1. Check torque specifications:
   - AN-6: 25-30 ft-lbs
   - AN-8: 30-35 ft-lbs
   - AN-10: 35-40 ft-lbs
2. For ORB fittings, inspect O-ring:
   - Replace if cut, pinched, or missing
   - Lubricate O-ring with clean oil
3. Do NOT use thread sealant on AN fittings (flare seal)
4. Ensure fitting is not cross-threaded
5. Check if fitting is fully engaged before torquing

**Prevention:** Follow proper torque specs, use new O-rings, avoid over-tightening

---

### Issue: Fitting Seized or Won't Come Apart
**Symptoms:** Cannot remove fitting, stuck threads

**Causes:**
- Over-torqued during installation
- Corrosion from dissimilar metals
- Thread galling (aluminum to aluminum)

**Solutions:**
1. Apply penetrating oil and let sit overnight
2. Use heat (150-200°F max) to expand fitting
3. Use proper size wrench - do not round off hex
4. Apply steady pressure while turning (no jerking)
5. For seized ORB fittings, replace the fitting

**Prevention:** Use anti-seize on aluminum threads, follow torque specs

---

## Fuel Pump Issues

### Issue: Fuel Pump Not Priming
**Symptoms:** No fuel flow when key turned on, no pump sound

**Causes:**
- No power to pump
- Blown fuse
- Faulty relay
- Bad ground connection
- Pump failure

**Solutions:**
1. Check fuse box for blown pump fuse
2. Test for 12V at pump connector with key on
3. Check ground connection (clean and tight)
4. Listen for pump prime (2-3 second whir when key turned on)
5. Bypass relay to test pump directly
6. If no sound and 12V present, pump may be bad

**Prevention:** Use proper gauge wiring, ensure clean connections

---

### Issue: Low Fuel Pressure
**Symptoms:** Engine runs lean, pressure gauge reads low

**Causes:**
- Clogged fuel filter
- Weak pump
- Voltage drop (undersized wiring)
- Restricted fuel line
- Regulator set too low

**Solutions:**
1. Replace fuel filter (first step)
2. Check voltage at pump under load (should be 13-14V)
3. Verify fuel line size is adequate:
   - EFI systems: -6 AN minimum (return style)
   - EFI systems: -8 AN minimum (returnless)
4. Check regulator settings
5. Test pump output with pressure gauge

**Common Filter Replacement:** Every 10,000 miles or annually

---

### Issue: Fuel Pump is Noisy
**Symptoms:** Whining, grinding, or loud humming

**Causes:**
- Low fuel level (cavitation)
- Clogged pre-filter/sock
- Air in fuel system
- Failing pump
- Pump not submerged (in-tank pumps)

**Solutions:**
1. Keep fuel tank over 1/4 full
2. Check pre-filter/sock for debris
3. Bleed air from fuel system
4. Verify pump is fully submerged (in-tank)
5. If noise persists, pump may be failing

**Prevention:** Regular filter changes, keep tank above 1/4 full

## Leak Detection & Resolution

### Step 1: Locate the Leak
- Wipe area clean and dry
- Turn on fuel pump (key on, engine off)
- Watch for fuel seepage
- Check all fittings, connections, and hose ends
- Use paper towel to find small leaks

### Step 2: Identify Leak Type

**Fitting Connection Leak:**
- Tighten to proper torque spec
- If still leaking, disassemble and inspect
- Look for damaged threads or cross-threading

**Hose End Leak:**
- Check if ferrule is properly seated
- Verify fitting is fully engaged on hose
- Replace if hose is damaged at connection

**O-Ring Leak (ORB Fittings):**
- Inspect O-ring for damage
- Replace O-ring
- Lubricate new O-ring before assembly

**Hose Body Leak:**
- Inspect for punctures or cuts
- Check for kinks causing pressure buildup
- Replace hose section if damaged

### Step 3: Fix and Retest
1. Make repair
2. Wipe area clean again
3. Pressurize system
4. Check for leaks
5. Run engine and recheck at operating pressure
6. Mark repair date on fuel system diagram

**Safety:** Always depressurize fuel system before working on fittings!

## Installation Problems

### Issue: Can't Get Fitting to Seal
**Problem:** Tried tightening but still leaks

**Solution:**
1. Disassemble completely
2. Inspect flare seat on fitting
3. Check hose end for damage
4. Ensure fitting is AN type (not NPT or ORB) where AN connection needed
5. Verify you're using matching AN dash sizes
6. Reassemble with proper technique

**Proper Assembly:**
1. Hand-thread fitting until snug
2. Mark fitting position with paint pen
3. Tighten to torque spec with wrench
4. Check that fitting moved only 1/4 to 1/2 turn from hand-tight

---

### Issue: Stripped Threads
**Problem:** Fitting spins freely, won't tighten

**Solution:**
- For hose-end fitting: Cut off fitting and use new one
- For component (pump, regulator, etc.): Use thread repair kit or replace component
- Never use damaged fittings - safety risk

**Prevention:** Start all fittings by hand, never force

---

### Issue: Wrong Parts Ordered
**Problem:** Parts don't fit as expected

**Solution:**
1. Verify all part numbers against order
2. Check installation guide for correct fitment
3. Take photos and email support@hotrodan.com
4. We'll help identify correct parts
5. Easy exchanges available (see refund policy)

**Common Mix-ups:**
- AN-6 vs. AN-8 sizing
- ORB vs. AN fitting types
- Straight vs. 45° vs. 90° angles
- Male vs. female ends

---

## Compatibility Issues

### Issue: Fitting Doesn't Match Component Port
**Problem:** Threads don't match between fitting and component

**Common Scenarios:**
1. **NPT to AN:** Need adapter (Part #: HRA-NPT-AN6/8/10)
2. **ORB to AN:** Need adapter (Part #: HRA-ORB-AN6/8/10)
3. **Metric to AN:** Need specialty adapter (Part #: HRA-METRIC-AN6)
4. **Quick-disconnect to AN:** Need adapter (Part #: HRA-QD-AN6)

**Solution:** Identify both thread types and select correct adapter from our catalog

---

### Issue: Hose Size Not Adequate for Application
**Problem:** Pressure drop, poor engine performance

**Guidelines:**
- **Naturally aspirated 400-600 HP:** -6 AN supply, -6 AN return
- **Naturally aspirated 600+ HP:** -8 AN supply, -6 AN return
- **Forced induction (turbo/supercharger):** -8 AN supply minimum
- **High HP (800+ HP):** -10 AN supply, -8 AN return

**Solution:** Upgrade to larger hose size if needed
