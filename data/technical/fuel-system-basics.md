## Fuel System Components

### 1. Fuel Tank
**Function:** Stores fuel and provides clean supply to pump  
**Key Features:**
- Baffles (prevent fuel starvation in corners)
- Vented cap (allows air in as fuel leaves)
- In-tank filter/sock (prevents debris from reaching pump)

**Hot Rod Considerations:**
- Original tank vs. fuel cell
- Capacity for intended use
- Mounting location and safety

---

### 2. Fuel Pump
**Function:** Moves fuel from tank to engine at required pressure and volume

**Types:**
- **In-tank (submersible):** Quieter, cooler operation, fuel-cooled
- **Inline (external):** Easier to access, higher flow rates available
- **Mechanical:** Engine-driven, works with carburetors

**Key Specifications:**
- **Flow rate (LPH or GPH):** How much fuel pump moves
- **Pressure rating (PSI):** Maximum output pressure
- **Voltage requirements:** Usually 12V, some 13.5V optimal

**Sizing Guidelines:**
| Engine HP | Fuel Type | Minimum LPH | Recommended Pump |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 400-600 HP | Gas | 190-255 LPH | Walbro 255 / Spectra 190 |
| 600-800 HP | Gas | 255-340 LPH | Walbro 255 / Aeromotive 340 |
| 800+ HP | Gas | 340+ LPH | Aeromotive 340 / Dual pumps |
| Turbo/Supercharged | Gas | +20% over NA | Size for boost HP |
| E85 | Ethanol | +30% over gas | Larger pump needed |

---

### 3. Fuel Filter
**Function:** Removes contaminants before fuel reaches engine

**Types:**
- **Pre-pump (sock/screen):** Protects pump from large debris
- **Post-pump (inline):** Catches fine particles before injectors/carb
- **High-pressure:** For EFI systems (typically -6 AN ports)

**Replacement Schedule:**
- Every 10,000 miles for street cars
- Every season for race cars
- Immediately if pump noise increases
- After any fuel tank work

---

### 4. Fuel Pressure Regulator
**Function:** Maintains constant fuel pressure to engine

**Types:**
- **Return style:** Excess fuel returns to tank (better for high HP)
- **Returnless:** No return line (simpler, OEM style)
- **Deadhead:** Regulator at pump (older systems)

**Pressure Requirements:**
- **Carbureted:** 5-7 PSI
- **TBI (throttle body injection):** 10-15 PSI
- **Port EFI:** 40-45 PSI base (58 PSI with boost)
- **Direct injection:** 500+ PSI (requires special pump)

---

### 5. Fuel Lines
**Function:** Transport fuel from tank to engine

**Material Options:**
- **Steel hardline:** Most durable, requires bending
- **AN braided hose:** Flexible, reusable fittings, professional grade
- **Rubber hose:** Budget option, degrades with ethanol
- **PTFE braided hose:** Best option - E85 compatible, durable, reusable

**Why PTFE for Performance:**
- ✅ Compatible with all fuels (gas, E85, methanol, racing fuel)
- ✅ Withstands high pressure (1500+ PSI)
- ✅ Resists heat (engine bay temperatures)
- ✅ Reusable fittings (rebuild-friendly)
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Lasts lifetime with proper installation

---

## Fuel Line Sizing

### AN Sizing Explained
**AN (Army-Navy) Standard:**
- AN number = hose ID in 16ths of an inch
- AN-6 = 6/16" = 3/8" ID
- AN-8 = 8/16" = 1/2" ID
- AN-10 = 10/16" = 5/8" ID

### Sizing for Horsepower

**Return-Style Systems:**
| Horsepower | Supply Line | Return Line |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Up to 400 HP | AN-6 (3/8") | AN-6 (3/8") |
| 400-650 HP | AN-6 or AN-8 | AN-6 |
| 650-850 HP | AN-8 (1/2") | AN-6 or AN-8 |
| 850+ HP | AN-10 (5/8") | AN-8 (1/2") |
| 1000+ HP | AN-10 or dual AN-8 | AN-8 or AN-10 |

**Returnless Systems:**
- Use one size larger than return-style recommendation
- 400-600 HP: AN-8 minimum
- 600+ HP: AN-10 minimum

**Forced Induction (Turbo/Supercharger):**
- Add 20-30% to horsepower for sizing
- Always go larger if in doubt
- Boost increases fuel demand significantly

**Reality:** Line must match pump and engine demand. Oversized lines can cause:
- Fuel pressure regulation issues
- Slower pressure response
- More fuel in system (harder to tune)
- Unnecessary weight and cost

**Right sizing = matching flow capacity to engine demand**

---

### Myth: "I need a huge fuel pump for my build"
**Reality:** Pump should flow 20-30% more than engine maximum demand
- Oversized pumps waste electrical power
- Can cause pressure control problems
- Cost more and are heavier
- Use the sizing chart above

---

### Myth: "Rubber hose is fine for performance builds"
**Reality:** Rubber hose degrades with:
- Ethanol fuels (E85)
- High temperatures
- Pressure pulsations
- Time (dry rot)

**PTFE braided hose lasts longer, handles all fuels, and is safer long-term**

---

### Myth: "AN fittings are just for looks"
**Reality:** AN fittings provide:
- Reusable connections (rebuild-friendly)
- Leak-free flare seals
- Standardized sizing
- Professional reliability

- Usually leaded (check local regulations)
- Excellent with PTFE systems
- May require jetting changes

**Methanol:**
- Extremely corrosive
- Requires stainless or PTFE everything
- 2x the fuel volume of gasoline
- Special safety considerations

---

## Calculating Fuel System Requirements

### Step 1: Determine Horsepower
- Naturally aspirated: Advertised HP
- Forced induction: Add boost HP
- Example: 500 HP engine + 8 PSI boost = ~650 HP total

### Step 2: Calculate Fuel Flow Required
**Formula:** HP ÷ BSFC = LPH  
(BSFC = Brake Specific Fuel Consumption)

**Typical BSFC Values:**
- Naturally aspirated gas: 0.5
- Forced induction gas: 0.55
- E85: 0.65
- Methanol: 1.0

**Example:** 650 HP forced induction on gas  
650 ÷ 0.55 = 1182 lb/hr ÷ 6.25 = 189 LPH minimum

**Add 20-30% safety margin:** 189 × 1.25 = 236 LPH → **Use 255 LPH pump**

### Step 3: Size Fuel Lines
Reference the sizing chart above based on total horsepower

### Step 4: Select Regulator
- Match to fuel type (gas vs. E85)
- Ensure flow capacity exceeds demand
- Choose return vs. returnless based on system design

## Fuel System Pressure Drop

### Understanding Pressure Drop
- Every foot of line creates resistance
- Fittings and filters add restriction
- Longer/smaller lines = more pressure drop

**Pressure Drop Factors:**
- **Line diameter:** Bigger = less drop
- **Line length:** Shorter = less drop
- **Fitting count:** Fewer = less drop
- **Filter restriction:** Clean = less drop

**Typical Pressure Drops:**
- 10 feet of AN-6: ~2 PSI at 255 LPH
- 10 feet of AN-8: ~0.8 PSI at 255 LPH
- Each 90° fitting: ~0.3-0.5 PSI
- Dirty filter: 2-5 PSI

**Minimizing Pressure Drop:**
- Use shortest practical line length
- Minimize fitting count
- Use largest practical line size
- Replace filters regularly
- Use smooth-bore fittings

---
