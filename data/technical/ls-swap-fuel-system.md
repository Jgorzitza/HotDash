### Fuel Line Routing for LS Swaps

**Engine Bay Routing:**
1. **Enter through firewall:** Low on driver or passenger side
2. **Route along frame rail:** Away from exhaust
3. **Cross to fuel rail:** Use 45° fittings to avoid kinks
4. **Return line:** Route alongside supply, back to tank
5. **Secure every 12-18":** Use P-clamps (not zip ties)

**Common Routing Challenges:**
- **Headers in the way:** Route lines UNDER frame, not over exhaust
- **Tight firewall space:** Use 90° fittings to clear
- **Crossmember interference:** May need to notch or rerout
- **AC lines:** Keep fuel lines separated from refrigerant lines

**Pro Tips:**
- Measure twice, order once
- Add 2-3 feet extra for routing flexibility
- Use 45° and 90° fittings liberally to avoid kinks
- Pre-fit lines before cutting to length

---

### Wiring the Fuel Pump

**Circuit Requirements:**
- **Wire gauge:** 12 AWG minimum for 255 LPH, 10 AWG for 340 LPH
- **Relay:** 30A automotive relay (SPST is fine)
- **Fuse:** 20-30A at battery (depends on pump)
- **Ground:** Direct to chassis, clean connection
- **Trigger:** From ECU fuel pump output or oil pressure switch

**Relay Wiring:**
```
Pin 30: +12V from battery (through fuse)
Pin 87: To fuel pump (+12V output)
Pin 86: Ground
Pin 85: Trigger from ECU or oil pressure switch
```

**Safety Feature:** Oil pressure switch ensures pump stops if engine stalls (prevents fire)

---

### Fuel Pressure Regulator Install

**Mounting Location:**
- Near fuel rail (keeps regulated fuel close to injectors)
- Easy access for adjustment
- Vacuum line can reach intake manifold
- Return line can route back to tank

**Vacuum Reference:**
- Connect to intake manifold vacuum port
- Maintains consistent injector pressure differential
- Use 1/8 NPT port on intake
- 3/16" or 1/4" vacuum line

**Initial Setup:**
- Set base pressure to 58 PSI (key on, engine off, vacuum line disconnected)
- Verify pressure drops to 43-45 PSI at idle (vacuum line connected)
- Pressure should return to 58 PSI at WOT

## Tuning & Testing

### Initial Fuel Pressure Setup

**Step 1: Static Pressure (Key On, Engine Off)**
1. Turn key to ON (don't start engine)
2. Fuel pump should prime for 2-3 seconds
3. Check pressure gauge: Should read 58 PSI
4. If not, adjust regulator

**Step 2: Idle Pressure (Engine Running, Vacuum Applied)**
1. Start engine and let idle
2. Pressure should drop to 43-45 PSI (with vacuum connected)
3. This is correct - manifold vacuum pulls pressure down
4. If wrong, check vacuum line connection

**Step 3: WOT Pressure (Full Throttle)**
1. Rev engine or drive car at WOT
2. Pressure should return to 58 PSI (no vacuum at WOT)
3. If pressure drops, pump may be undersized

**Boost Pressure (Forced Induction):**
- Pressure should rise 1:1 with boost
- Example: 10 PSI boost = 68 PSI fuel pressure (58 + 10)
- Regulator must have boost reference port

---

### Fuel System Testing

**Leak Test:**
1. Pressurize system (key on, engine off)
2. Inspect every fitting and connection
3. Fix any leaks before starting engine
4. Retest after running engine to temperature

**Flow Test:**
1. Disconnect return line at tank
2. Run into graduated container
3. Pump should flow rated capacity
4. If low, check for restrictions

**Pressure Test Under Load:**
1. Drive car hard or dyno pull
2. Monitor fuel pressure continuously
3. Pressure should remain stable
4. Any drop indicates inadequate flow

- Configure fuel pump prime time

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptoms: Engine Won't Start

**Fuel System Checks:**
1. Does pump prime when key turned on? (listen for whir)
2. Is there fuel pressure? (check gauge)
3. Are injectors getting signal? (test light or multimeter)
4. Is there fuel in tank? (obvious but worth checking)

**If No Pump Prime:**
- Check ECU is providing trigger signal
- Test relay operation
- Verify fuse not blown
- Check all electrical connections

---

### Symptoms: Engine Starts but Dies

**Common Causes:**
1. **Low fuel pressure** → Check regulator setting
2. **Air in lines** → Prime system several times
3. **Injectors not firing** → Check injector power and signal
4. **MAF sensor unplugged** → Verify all sensors connected

---

### Symptoms: Poor Performance or Misfires

**Fuel-Related Causes:**
1. **Clogged filter** → Replace filter
2. **Weak pump** → Test fuel pressure under load
3. **Wrong pressure** → Verify 58 PSI base, 43-45 idle
4. **Injectors dirty** → Run fuel system cleaner or service injectors

## FAQs: LS Swap Fuel Systems

**Q: Can I use my stock fuel pump for an LS swap?**  
A: If it's from an LS vehicle and rated 190+ LPH, yes for mild builds (up to 450 HP). For 500+ HP, upgrade to Walbro 255.

**Q: Do I need a return-style system?**  
A: Not required, but recommended for 600+ HP and all boosted applications. Better tunability and reliability.

**Q: What fuel pressure should I run?**  
A: 58 PSI base (key on, vacuum line off). 43-45 PSI at idle (vacuum connected). This matches factory LS spec.

**Q: Can I use rubber fuel line?**  
A: Not recommended. Rubber degrades with E85 and heat. PTFE braided hose is safer, lasts longer, and handles all fuels.

**Q: What size fuel line for a 500 HP LS3?**  
A: AN-6 supply and AN-6 return (return-style), or single AN-8 (returnless). Both work fine for 500 HP.

**Q: Do I need a bigger fuel pump for E85?**  
A: Yes. E85 requires 30% more fuel volume. 500 HP on E85 needs pump sized for 650 HP on gas.

**Q: How do I know if my pump is big enough?**  
A: Monitor fuel pressure at WOT. If it drops below 55 PSI, pump is maxed out. Upgrade to larger pump.

**Q: Can I use existing fuel lines from my old engine?**  
A: Only if they're metal or PTFE. Replace rubber lines. Verify size is adequate for your power level.
