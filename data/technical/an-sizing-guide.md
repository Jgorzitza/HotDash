## AN Size Chart

### Understanding AN Dash Sizes

**AN Number = Inner Diameter in 16ths of an Inch**

| AN Size | Fraction | Decimal | Common Use |
|---------|----------|---------|------------|
| AN-3 | 3/16" | 0.1875" | Oil lines, small fluid lines |
| AN-4 | 1/4" | 0.250" | Oil return, power steering |
| AN-6 | 3/8" | 0.375" | Fuel supply/return (up to 600 HP) |
| AN-8 | 1/2" | 0.500" | Fuel supply (600-850 HP) |
| AN-10 | 5/8" | 0.625" | Fuel supply (850+ HP), oil supply |
| AN-12 | 3/4" | 0.750" | High HP fuel, dry sump oil |
| AN-16 | 1" | 1.000" | Extreme HP applications |

**Most Common for Hot Rods:**
- **AN-6:** Fuel lines for most street/strip builds
- **AN-8:** Fuel lines for big power or simplified routing
- **AN-10:** Fuel lines for 800+ HP builds

## Fuel Line Sizing by Application

### Naturally Aspirated Engines

**400-500 HP:**
- **Supply:** AN-6
- **Return:** AN-6
- **Why:** Adequate flow, cost-effective, easy to route

**500-650 HP:**
- **Supply:** AN-6 or AN-8 (AN-8 preferred)
- **Return:** AN-6
- **Why:** AN-8 provides headroom for growth

**650-850 HP:**
- **Supply:** AN-8
- **Return:** AN-6 or AN-8
- **Why:** AN-8 reduces pressure drop

**850+ HP:**
- **Supply:** AN-10
- **Return:** AN-8
- **Why:** High flow capacity needed

---

### Forced Induction (Turbo/Supercharger)

**Rule of Thumb:** Size fuel system for total HP with boost, not engine displacement

**Example:**
- 500 HP engine + 10 PSI boost = ~700 HP total
- Size fuel system for 700 HP
- Supply: AN-8, Return: AN-6

**Boost Fuel Demands:**
- 8 PSI boost: +40% fuel demand
- 12 PSI boost: +60% fuel demand
- 16 PSI boost: +80% fuel demand

**Recommendation:** Use return-style system for all boosted applications

---

### E85 Ethanol Fuel

**Critical:** E85 requires 30% more fuel volume than gasoline

**Sizing Adjustment:**
- Calculate for gasoline HP
- Multiply by 1.3
- Size for resulting number

**Example:**
- 600 HP on gasoline normally needs AN-6 or AN-8
- 600 HP on E85: 600 × 1.3 = 780 HP worth of fuel
- Use AN-8 or AN-10 for E85

**Additional E85 Requirements:**
- PTFE lines required (rubber fails with ethanol)
- Larger fuel pump (+30% flow)
- Larger injectors (+30%)
- Compatible fuel system components

---

## Fitting Types & Applications

### Hose End Fittings

**Straight:**
- **Use:** When components align in straight line
- **Pros:** Simplest, lowest restriction
- **Cons:** Cannot adjust angle
- **Common:** Tank to filter, filter to regulator

**45-Degree:**
- **Use:** Moderate direction changes
- **Pros:** Avoids kinks, adjustable (swivel)
- **Cons:** Slightly more restriction than straight
- **Common:** Firewall pass-through, tight engine bay routing

**90-Degree:**
- **Use:** Sharp direction changes
- **Pros:** Avoids kinks in tight spaces
- **Cons:** More restriction than straight or 45°
- **Common:** Fuel rail connections, tight turns

**Swivel vs. Fixed:**
- **Swivel:** Can rotate after installation (easier to align)
- **Fixed:** Cannot rotate (requires precise measurement)
- **Recommendation:** Always use swivel for easier assembly

---

### Adapter Fittings

**AN Male to NPT Male:**
- **Use:** Connecting AN hose to threaded ports (fuel pump, regulator)
- **Thread sealant:** YES on NPT side, NO on AN side
- **Example:** Fuel rail to AN line

**AN Male to ORB (O-Ring Boss):**
- **Use:** Connecting to O-ring sealed ports
- **Requires:** O-ring, lubricated
- **No sealant:** O-ring provides seal
- **Example:** Transmission cooler ports

**AN Male to Quick-Disconnect:**
- **Use:** Connecting to factory quick-disconnect fittings
- **Includes:** Screw-on dust cap
- **Example:** LS fuel rail to AN line (some applications)

**Unions & Reducers:**
- **Union:** Connects two hoses together (same size)
- **Reducer:** Connects two different sizes (AN-8 to AN-6)
- **Expander:** Connects small to large (AN-6 to AN-8)

---

## How to Select Fittings for Your Build

### Step 1: Identify Your Ports

**Check each component:**
- Fuel pump: What type of outlet? (NPT, AN, barb)
- Fuel filter: Inlet and outlet sizes? (usually -6 AN)
- Regulator: Inlet, outlet, return sizes? (usually -6 AN)
- Fuel rail: What connections? (AN, quick-disconnect, barb)

**Common Port Types:**
- **NPT:** Tapered pipe thread (needs sealant)
- **AN:** Straight thread with flare (no sealant)
- **ORB:** Straight thread with O-ring groove
- **Barb:** Push-on for rubber hose
- **Quick-disconnect:** Push-to-connect

---

### Step 2: Measure Line Routing

**For Each Line:**
1. Route from start to end point (don't cut!)
2. Account for bends and direction changes
3. Add 2-3 feet extra (can't add length later)
4. Note where you'll need angled fittings
5. Count total fittings needed

**Example Supply Line (Tank to Rail):**
- Tank outlet to firewall: 6 feet straight
- Firewall pass-through: 1 × 45° fitting
- Firewall to filter: 2 feet
- Filter to regulator: 1 foot
- Regulator to rail: 1 foot, 1 × 90° fitting

**Total:** 10 feet hose, 1 × 45° fitting, 1 × 90° fitting, 2 × straight fittings

---

### Step 3: Create Parts List

**Per Hose End:**
- 1 × Hose end fitting (straight/45°/90°)
- 1 × Adapter (if needed to connect to component)

**Typical AN-6 Fuel System:**
- 10 feet AN-6 PTFE hose (supply)
- 10 feet AN-6 PTFE hose (return)
- 4 × AN-6 straight swivel hose ends
- 2 × AN-6 45° swivel hose ends
- 2 × AN-6 90° swivel hose ends
- 4 × AN-6 to NPT adapters (for pump, filter, regulator, rail)
- 10 × P-clamps for mounting

**Hot Rod AN Bundle Deals:**
- Includes hose + 8 fittings (variety of angles)
- Pre-calculated for typical installations
- Saves 15-20% vs. individual parts

---

## Torque Specifications

### Proper Torque = No Leaks

**AN Hose End Fittings:**
| AN Size | Torque (ft-lbs) | Wrench Turn from Hand-Tight |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| AN-3 | 15-20 ft-lbs | 1/4 turn |
| AN-4 | 20-25 ft-lbs | 1/4 to 1/3 turn |
| AN-6 | 25-30 ft-lbs | 1/4 to 1/2 turn |
| AN-8 | 30-35 ft-lbs | 1/4 to 1/2 turn |
| AN-10 | 35-40 ft-lbs | 1/4 to 1/2 turn |
| AN-12 | 40-45 ft-lbs | 1/4 to 1/2 turn |

**Important:**
- ❌ **Do NOT over-tighten** (damages threads and seal)
- ✅ **Use torque wrench** for critical connections
- ✅ **Hand-tighten first** then wrench to spec
- ✅ **Check for leaks** after torquing
- ❌ **Never use thread sealant** on AN flare fittings

---

### Assembly Technique

**Proper AN Fitting Assembly:**
1. Slide fitting body onto hose
2. Mark hose at 1.5" from end (insertion depth)
3. Push ferrule onto hose up to mark
4. Use vice jaws or rubber mallet if tight
5. Thread hose end into fitting body BY HAND
6. When hand-tight, mark fitting position
7. Use wrench to turn 1/4 to 1/2 turn more
8. Check that fitting moved the right amount
9. Pressurize and check for leaks

## Common Sizing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Oversizing Everything
**Problem:** "I'll use AN-10 for everything to be safe"  
**Reality:**
- Unnecessary cost (+40% vs. AN-6)
- Harder to route (large bend radius)
- Heavier
- Overkill for most street cars

**Right Approach:** Size appropriately for your power level

---

### Mistake 2: Undersizing to Save Money
**Problem:** "AN-6 is cheaper, I'll use it for my 800 HP build"  
**Reality:**
- Pressure drop robs power
- Pump works harder (shorter life)
- Poor performance at high RPM
- Dangerous if pump can't keep up

**Right Approach:** Don't cheap out on fuel system safety

---

### Mistake 3: Mixing Sizes Randomly
**Problem:** "I have AN-8 supply and AN-10 return"  
**Reality:**
- Return line doesn't need to be larger than supply
- Wasted money on oversized return
- Harder to find fittings

**Right Approach:**
- Supply = sized for HP
- Return = one size smaller OR same as supply
- Never return larger than supply

---

### Mistake 4: Not Accounting for Adapters
**Problem:** Ordering hose and hose ends without adapters  
**Reality:**
- Hose ends connect to HOSE
- Still need adapters to connect to COMPONENTS
- Most fuel pumps, filters, regulators use NPT or ORB ports

**Right Approach:**
- Identify component port types FIRST
- Order matching adapters
- Use Hot Rod AN's complete kits (includes adapters)

---

## Installation Tips

### Measuring for Success

**Step 1: Mock Up Installation**
- Route hose from start to finish WITHOUT cutting
- Mark where fittings will go
- Note angles needed (straight, 45°, 90°)
- Add 6-12" extra for safety

**Step 2: Account for Fittings**
- Each AN-6 fitting takes ~1.5" of hose
- Each AN-8 fitting takes ~1.75" of hose
- Count both ends of each hose
- Example: 10 ft hose - 8 fittings = ~9 ft usable

**Step 3: Order Smart**
- Round up on hose length
- Can't add length after cutting (custom-cut = final sale)
- Better to have extra than come up short

---

### Cutting & Assembly

**Cutting PTFE Hose:**
- ✅ **Use:** AN hose cutting shears (proper tool)
- ❌ **Never:** Knife, scissors, bolt cutters, wire cutters
- ✅ **Technique:** Straight cut, perpendicular to hose
- ✅ **Result:** Clean cut exposes PTFE liner properly

**Why Proper Cutting Matters:**
- Ragged cuts don't seal properly
- Damaged liner can leak
- Improper cut makes fitting assembly difficult
- Safety concern (fuel leaks)

**Assembly Process:**
1. Slide fitting body onto hose (before cutting to length!)
2. Cut hose to final length
3. Push ferrule onto hose (requires force - use vice jaws)
4. Thread hose end into fitting body (hand-tight first)
5. Tighten to torque spec with wrench

---

## Troubleshooting Sizing Issues

### Problem: "My fitting won't screw onto the hose end"

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Wrong size combination** → AN-6 hose with AN-8 fitting
2. **Cross-threaded** → Back out and restart carefully
3. **Ferrule not seated** → Push ferrule all the way on
4. **Damaged threads** → Inspect and replace if needed

**Solution:**
- Verify all part numbers match size
- Start threads by hand (never force with wrench)
- Check that AN dash number matches on all parts

---

### Problem: "My adapter fitting doesn't fit the component"

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Wrong thread type** → NPT vs. ORB vs. AN confusion
2. **Wrong size** → 1/8 NPT vs. 1/4 NPT, etc.
3. **Missing O-ring** → ORB fittings need O-rings

**Solution:**
- Identify component thread type (NPT tapered, ORB straight, etc.)
- Measure thread size
- Order correct adapter: AN to [component thread type]

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use compression fittings instead of AN?**  
A: Not recommended for fuel systems. Compression fittings can loosen with vibration and don't seal as reliably as AN flare fittings.

**Q: Is stainless braided better than nylon?**  
A: Same performance (both use PTFE liner). Stainless is more abrasion-resistant and looks better. Nylon is lighter and more flexible. Choose based on preference.

**Q: Do I really need a torque wrench?**  
A: Highly recommended. Over-tightening damages fittings, under-tightening causes leaks. Torque wrench ensures it's right the first time.

**Q: Can I reuse AN fittings?**  
A: Yes! That's the advantage of AN. They're reusable many times. Just inspect for damage before each use.

**Q: How do I know what adapters I need?**  
A: Identify the thread type on your component (NPT, ORB, etc.), then order "AN to [that thread type]" adapter in the matching AN size.
