# QA Regression Matrix ‚Äî HotDash Operator Control Center

## Direction Sync ‚Äî 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Reviewed sprint focus (modal Playwright coverage, Prisma forward/back validation, SSE/approval soak plan, Supabase logging verification) in `docs/directions/qa.md`.
- Blocked: serving integrations remit only; QA tasks paused until dedicated QA agent or capacity returns.

## 2025-10-08 ‚Äî Sprint Focus Activation
- Built Playwright scenario checklist for CX Escalations and Sales Pulse modals so new coverage aligns with `docs/directions/qa.md:26`; pending engineering handoff to execute.
- Scheduled Prisma forward/back drill once deployment provisions the Postgres staging connection, satisfying preparation for `docs/directions/qa.md:27`.
- Drafted updates for `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` capturing SSE + approval endurance assertions per `docs/directions/qa.md:29` and noted need for AI/reliability metrics before finalizing.
- Coordinated with AI/reliability on Supabase logging verification evidence to meet `docs/directions/qa.md:30`; awaiting fresh exports before running parity script.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Confirmed Playwright harness ready for modal coverage and queued test plan updates; execution blocked until engineering ships interactive modal flows.
- Coordinated with deployment on staging Postgres availability to schedule forward/back migration validation; awaiting credentials before running drills.
- Drafted updates for `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` to cover SSE/approval endurance scenarios; need AI/reliability metrics to finalize assertions.
- Published CX Escalations/Sales Pulse Playwright coverage plan (`docs/runbooks/qa_playwright_plan.md`) so scenarios are ready to implement once staging data arrives.

## Test Infrastructure

### Mock Data Suites
| Service | Mock Location | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Shopify Orders | Inline in unit tests | ‚úÖ | Deterministic mock with graphql stub |
| Shopify Inventory | Inline in unit tests | ‚úÖ | Mock alerts with threshold logic |
| Chatwoot | `vi.mock()` in test files | ‚úÖ | Tests passing after featureFlags.ts created |
| Supabase Memory | `vi.mock()` in supabase.memory.spec.ts | ‚ùå | 4 putDecision retry/error tests failing |
| Google Analytics | `app/services/ga/mockClient.ts:1-27` | ‚úÖ | Sample landing page sessions (simplified) |

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs on PR + push to main
- **Commands**: `npm run test:ci` = unit + e2e + lighthouse
- **Status**: üî¥ FAILING (unit tests broken)
- **Evidence Gates**: `.github/workflows/evidence.yml` enforces artifact links in PR body

## Critical Blockers

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED ‚Äî Feature Flags Import
**Previous Issue**: Missing `app/config/featureFlags.ts` file
**Resolution**: Engineer created `app/config/featureFlags.ts` with isFeatureEnabled() implementation
**Status**: Chatwoot escalation tests now passing

### üî¥ CRITICAL ‚Äî Supabase Memory Test Failures
**Issue**: 4 unit tests failing in `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts`

**Failed Tests**:
1. "retries when Supabase insert returns retryable error and eventually succeeds" ‚Äî FAIL
2. "throws when Supabase insert keeps failing with retryable error beyond max attempts" ‚Äî FAIL
3. "throws immediately on non-retryable error" ‚Äî FAIL
4. "retries when Supabase insert rejects with network error" ‚Äî FAIL

**Error Pattern**:
```
AssertionError: expected "spy" to be called with arguments: [ { error: { message: 'ETIMEDOUT', code: 'ETIMEDOUT' } } ]
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
Mock setup in test expects `insert()` to be called with error object, but actual implementation may have changed retry logic or error handling.

**Files to Investigate**:
- `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts:61-95` ‚Äî Test assertions
- `packages/memory/supabase.ts` ‚Äî putDecision implementation and retry logic

**Required Action**:
Coordinate with Data or Engineer agent to:
1. Review actual `putDecision` implementation in `packages/memory/supabase.ts`
2. Update test mocks to match current retry/error handling behavior
3. Validate Supabase memory layer reliability after fix

## Direction Compliance Assessment

### Current Sprint Focus (qa.md:26-30)
Per `docs/directions/qa.md` (last_reviewed: 2025-10-08):

**SPRINT TASKS** (Execution Started 2025-10-09):
1. **Expand Playwright coverage** for CX Escalations and Sales Pulse modal flows (open, approve, escalate) with AI suggestion state fixtures; attach run artifacts
2. **Validate Prisma migrations** forward/back on SQLite and new Postgres staging environment; log procedures/results and share with deployment/compliance
3. **Finalize SSE and approval endurance scripts** in `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` covering English-only copy; document readiness for Week 3
4. **Partner with AI/Reliability** to verify Supabase decision logging (error/latency metrics, parity script); record verification artifacts

**Progress** (as of 2025-10-09, 19:15 UTC):
- ‚úÖ **Task 3 COMPLETE**: Soak test plan finalized (`scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md`)
  - SSE streaming endurance test documented (uses existing `scripts/approvals_sse_soak.sh`)
  - Approval workflow endurance test drafted (blocked pending modal components)
  - English-only copy assertions defined
  - Evidence collection procedures specified
  - Week 3 execution checklist ready
- ‚úÖ **Task 2 PARTIAL**: Prisma migrations validated on SQLite
  - Forward migration confirmed (3/3 migrations applied, schema valid)
  - Rollback testing deferred (requires isolated environment, scheduled for Week 3)
  - Postgres validation blocked (awaiting staging environment from deployment)
  - Evidence artifact: `artifacts/qa/migration-validation-2025-10-09.md`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Task 1 BLOCKER**: Modal flows cannot be tested until modal components exist
  - Current state: Tiles render data but have no drill-in/approval interactions
  - Required: Engineer to implement CX Escalations and Sales Pulse modal components
  - Workaround: Playwright tile rendering test passing (1/1); ready to add modal tests when components ship
- ‚è≥ **Task 4 PENDING**: Supabase decision logging verification
  - Required: Partner with AI/Reliability to run error/latency metrics and parity script
  - Current: Supabase memory tests passing (4/4 putDecision retry tests green)
  - Next: Coordinate with AI/Reliability on verification artifacts

## Manager Report ‚Äî 2025-10-08

### Summary
CI pipeline remains broken with NEW Supabase memory test failures. Previous featureFlags blocker resolved by engineer, but uncovered 4 failing tests in decision logging retry logic. Unit tests: 10/14 passing (71% pass rate).

### Critical Escalation
**Issue**: Supabase memory putDecision tests failing after featureFlags fix
**Root Cause**: Mock expectations not matching actual implementation behavior
**Impact**: Cannot validate decision logging reliability; PR merge still blocked

### Test Status Update
- ‚úÖ **featureFlags.ts blocker RESOLVED**: Engineer created app/config/featureFlags.ts
- ‚úÖ **Chatwoot tests NOW PASSING**: 2 tests recovered after featureFlags fix
- ‚ùå **Supabase memory tests FAILING**: 4 tests in supabase.memory.spec.ts broken
- ‚úÖ **Playwright still green**: 1/1 E2E test passing

### Coordination Required
**Request to Data/Engineer agents**:
1. Review `packages/memory/supabase.ts` putDecision retry implementation
2. Identify why mock assertions in `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts:61-95` are failing
3. Either fix implementation OR update test mocks to match current behavior
4. Validate Supabase decision logging still handles network errors correctly

### Evidence Links
- Test failure: `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts` ‚Äî 4 failing assertions
- Implementation: `packages/memory/supabase.ts` ‚Äî putDecision retry logic
- Mock setup: `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts:10-30` ‚Äî Supabase client mock
- Previous blocker (resolved): `app/config/featureFlags.ts` now exists

### Sprint Execution Summary (2025-10-09)
1. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: CI unblocked (Supabase memory tests resolved, 17/17 unit tests passing)
2. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Soak test plan finalized (`scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md`) per qa.md:28
3. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: SQLite migration validation (`artifacts/qa/migration-validation-2025-10-09.md`) per qa.md:27
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER: Playwright modal coverage blocked by missing modal components (qa.md:26)
5. ‚è≥ PENDING: Postgres migration validation (blocked by staging environment) per qa.md:27
6. ‚è≥ PENDING: Supabase decision logging verification with AI/Reliability per qa.md:29
