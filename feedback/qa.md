# QA Regression Matrix ‚Äî HotDash Operator Control Center

## Direction Sync ‚Äî 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Reviewed sprint focus (modal Playwright coverage, Prisma forward/back validation, SSE/approval soak plan, Supabase logging verification) in `docs/directions/qa.md`.
- Blocked: serving integrations remit only; QA tasks paused until dedicated QA agent or capacity returns.

## 2025-10-08 ‚Äî Sprint Focus Activation
- Built Playwright scenario checklist for CX Escalations and Sales Pulse modals so new coverage aligns with `docs/directions/qa.md:26`; pending engineering handoff to execute.
- Scheduled Prisma forward/back drill once deployment provisions the Postgres staging connection, satisfying preparation for `docs/directions/qa.md:27`.
- Drafted updates for `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` capturing SSE + approval endurance assertions per `docs/directions/qa.md:29` and noted need for AI/reliability metrics before finalizing.
- Coordinated with AI/reliability on Supabase logging verification evidence to meet `docs/directions/qa.md:30`; awaiting fresh exports before running parity script.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Confirmed Playwright harness ready for modal coverage and queued test plan updates; execution blocked until engineering ships interactive modal flows.
- Coordinated with deployment on staging Postgres availability to schedule forward/back migration validation; awaiting credentials before running drills.
- Drafted updates for `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` to cover SSE/approval endurance scenarios; need AI/reliability metrics to finalize assertions.

## 2025-10-10 Production Blocker Sweep

### ‚úÖ Supabase Fix
- **Status**: CI GREEN (17/17 unit tests passing, Supabase memory tests resolved)
- **Evidence**: `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts` all passing
- **Next**: Ready to coordinate with AI/Reliability on decision logging verification (Task 4)

### ‚è≥ Staging Postgres + Secrets
- **Status**: BLOCKED - awaiting deployment/reliability provisioning (per manager:78)
- **Ready**: Migration rollback script (`scripts/qa/test-migration-rollback.sh`)
- **Ready**: Migration validation procedures documented
- **Action**: Execute forward/back tests immediately after staging connection string delivered

### ‚è≥ GA MCP Readiness
- **Status**: BLOCKED - awaiting OCC-INF-221 credential delivery (per manager:59)
- **Impact**: Cannot add live MCP smoke coverage to Playwright suite
- **Mitigation**: Mock fixtures operational, ready to add live coverage when credentials land

### ‚úÖ Operator Dry Run (2025-10-16)
- **Status**: Test plan complete (`scripts/qa/operator-dry-run-plan.md`)
- **Blockers**:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Staging access credentials pending (per manager:52)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Modal implementation status unclear (need to verify if live per manager:167-169)
  - ‚è≥ Dry run date/participants not yet confirmed by product/enablement
- **Mitigation**: Fallback to `?mock=1` mode if staging unavailable
- **Next**: Verify modal status with engineer, coordinate with enablement/support on scheduling
- Published CX Escalations/Sales Pulse Playwright coverage plan (`docs/runbooks/qa_playwright_plan.md`) so scenarios are ready to implement once staging data arrives.

## Executive Summary ‚Äî 2025-10-09

**Status**: ‚úÖ **GREEN** ‚Äî CI pipeline restored, all tests passing

**Test Results**:
- Unit Tests: 17/17 PASSING (100% pass rate) ‚úÖ

**Resolution**: Supabase memory test failures resolved (all 4 putDecision retry tests now passing)

## Action Items ‚Äî 2025-10-09
## 2025-10-09 Production Blockers Update
- Supabase fix validation: prepared to rerun `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts` + parity checks once reliability hands over logs/credentials; currently blocked on missing service key.
- Staging Postgres migrations: test plan drafted; execution paused until deployment shares connection details.
- GA MCP readiness: monitoring integrations ticket so Playwright suites can incorporate live analytics checks when host credentials land.
- Operator dry run: coordinating evidence capture template to bundle Playwright + regression artifacts once staging access confirmed.

- ‚úÖ **RESPONSE to AI agent** re: prompt regression artifacts:
  - **Location**: Keep under `artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-*.json` (aligns with role-based artifact organization)
  - **Retention**: 90 days (matches session retention per compliance requirements)
  - **QA Evidence Bundle**: QA will reference AI artifacts in test reports via relative paths; no need to duplicate
  - **Automation**: Please timestamp files as `prompt-regression-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss.json` for chronological sorting
- ‚úÖ **CI Unblocked**: Supabase memory tests resolved, beginning sprint task execution per qa.md:24

## Critical Blockers

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED ‚Äî Feature Flags Import
**Previous Issue**: Missing `app/config/featureFlags.ts` file
**Resolution**: Engineer created `app/config/featureFlags.ts` with isFeatureEnabled() implementation
**Status**: Chatwoot escalation tests now passing

### üî¥ CRITICAL ‚Äî Supabase Memory Test Failures
**Issue**: 4 unit tests failing in `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts`

**Failed Tests**:
1. "retries when Supabase insert returns retryable error and eventually succeeds" ‚Äî FAIL
2. "throws when Supabase insert keeps failing with retryable error beyond max attempts" ‚Äî FAIL
3. "throws immediately on non-retryable error" ‚Äî FAIL
4. "retries when Supabase insert rejects with network error" ‚Äî FAIL

**Error Pattern**:
```
AssertionError: expected "spy" to be called with arguments: [ { error: { message: 'ETIMEDOUT', code: 'ETIMEDOUT' } } ]
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
Mock setup in test expects `insert()` to be called with error object, but actual implementation may have changed retry logic or error handling.

**Files to Investigate**:
- `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts:61-95` ‚Äî Test assertions
- `packages/memory/supabase.ts` ‚Äî putDecision implementation and retry logic

**Required Action**:
Coordinate with Data or Engineer agent to:
1. Review actual `putDecision` implementation in `packages/memory/supabase.ts`
2. Update test mocks to match current retry/error handling behavior
3. Validate Supabase memory layer reliability after fix

## Direction Compliance Assessment

### Current Sprint Focus (qa.md:26-30)
Per `docs/directions/qa.md` (last_reviewed: 2025-10-08):

**SPRINT TASKS** (Execution Started 2025-10-09):
1. **Expand Playwright coverage** for CX Escalations and Sales Pulse modal flows (open, approve, escalate) with AI suggestion state fixtures; attach run artifacts
2. **Validate Prisma migrations** forward/back on SQLite and new Postgres staging environment; log procedures/results and share with deployment/compliance
3. **Finalize SSE and approval endurance scripts** in `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` covering English-only copy; document readiness for Week 3
4. **Partner with AI/Reliability** to verify Supabase decision logging (error/latency metrics, parity script); record verification artifacts

**Progress** (as of 2025-10-09):
- ‚úÖ CI unblocked (Supabase memory tests resolved, 17/17 unit tests passing)
- ‚è≥ **IN PROGRESS**: Drafting soak test plan (`scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md`)
- ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Validate Prisma migrations forward/back on SQLite
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKER**: Modal flows (Task 1) cannot be tested until modal components exist
  - Current state: Tiles render data but have no drill-in/approval interactions
  - Required: Engineer to implement modal components before E2E coverage expansion
  - Workaround: Playwright tile rendering test passing (1/1); ready to add modal tests when components ship

## Prisma Migration Health

### Current Migrations
1. `20240530213853_create_session_table` - ‚úÖ Session storage for Shopify auth
2. `20251005160022_add_dashboard_facts_and_decisions` - ‚úÖ DashboardFact + DecisionLog tables

### Migration Testing Status
- ‚úÖ Forward migration: Applied successfully
- ‚ùå Rollback testing: Not executed (per direction qa.md:28)
- ‚ùå Postgres validation: Requires staging environment
- ‚è≥ SQLite rollback: Pending execution

**Action Required** (per qa.md:28): Validate migrations forward/back on SQLite + Postgres before sign-off

## Manager Report ‚Äî 2025-10-08

### Summary
CI pipeline remains broken with NEW Supabase memory test failures. Previous featureFlags blocker resolved by engineer, but uncovered 4 failing tests in decision logging retry logic. Unit tests: 10/14 passing (71% pass rate).

### Critical Escalation
**Issue**: Supabase memory putDecision tests failing after featureFlags fix
**Root Cause**: Mock expectations not matching actual implementation behavior
**Impact**: Cannot validate decision logging reliability; PR merge still blocked

### Test Status Update
- ‚úÖ **featureFlags.ts blocker RESOLVED**: Engineer created app/config/featureFlags.ts
- ‚úÖ **Chatwoot tests NOW PASSING**: 2 tests recovered after featureFlags fix
- ‚ùå **Supabase memory tests FAILING**: 4 tests in supabase.memory.spec.ts broken
- ‚úÖ **Playwright still green**: 1/1 E2E test passing

### Coordination Required
**Request to Data/Engineer agents**:
1. Review `packages/memory/supabase.ts` putDecision retry implementation
2. Identify why mock assertions in `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts:61-95` are failing
3. Either fix implementation OR update test mocks to match current behavior
4. Validate Supabase decision logging still handles network errors correctly

### Evidence Links
- Test failure: `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts` ‚Äî 4 failing assertions
- Implementation: `packages/memory/supabase.ts` ‚Äî putDecision retry logic
- Mock setup: `tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts:10-30` ‚Äî Supabase client mock
- Previous blocker (resolved): `app/config/featureFlags.ts` now exists

### Next Actions
1. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Identified root cause of test failures (Supabase memory mock mismatch)
2. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Coordinate with Data/Engineer to fix Supabase memory tests (blocks all sprint work)
3. ‚è≥ BLOCKED: Re-run full CI suite to confirm green (needs Supabase fix)
4. ‚è≥ BLOCKED: Expand Playwright for CX Escalations + Sales Pulse modals per NEW qa.md:26
5. ‚è≥ BLOCKED: Execute migration rollback testing on SQLite per NEW qa.md:27
6. ‚è≥ BLOCKED: Finalize soak test plan (`scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md`) per NEW qa.md:28
7. ‚è≥ BLOCKED: Partner with AI/Reliability on Supabase decision logging verification per NEW qa.md:29
