### Summary

- Authored anomaly response decision contract to unblock OCC-205 (`docs/strategy/anomaly_response_decision_spec.md`).

### Telemetry Ownership Decisions
| Metric | Primary Owner | Supporting Roles | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Activation Rate (rolling 7d) | Data (Jordan Alvarez) | Engineer (modal session hooks), Reliability (nightly monitoring) | `scripts/ops/run-nightly-metrics.ts`, `app/services/analytics.server.ts`, `feedback/data_to_reliability_coordination.md` |
| SLA Resolution Time | Data (Jordan Alvarez) | Reliability (alert thresholds), Support (runbook alignment) | `scripts/ops/run-nightly-metrics.ts`, `feedback/reliability.md`, `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md` |
| Anomaly Response Rate | Product (Justin) | Designer (assignment UX), Engineer (decision logging), Marketing (impact messaging) | `docs/directions/product_metrics.md`, `app/components/tiles/SEOContentTile.tsx`, `docs/design/copy_deck_modals.md`, `docs/strategy/anomaly_response_decision_spec.md` |

- Logged Linear assignments OCC-201 through OCC-205 to reflect ownership and status (see backlog doc).

### Marketing Asset Approvals (Product Sign-off)
| Asset | Decision | Rationale & Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launch communications packet (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`) | âœ… Approved with updates | Prefer Variation B headline + CTA (`ðŸŽ‰ Operator Control Center is here for your daily truth.` / `View Dashboard â†’`) to reinforce north-star value; confirm tooltip trigger on first dashboard visit with dismiss option. Beta-partner invite language "Your feedback shapes our roadmap" accepted â€” aligns with operator partnership framing. |
| Release notes template (`docs/marketing/release_notes_template.md`) | âœ… Approved | Evidence gates (Vitest, Playwright, Lighthouse, metrics) match delivery protocol; keep distribution list as proposed. Requested addition: include Ops Pulse metric thresholds (activation â‰¥70%, SLA median â‰¤60m) in template next revision. |
| Brand tone & talking points deck (`docs/marketing/brand_tone_deck.md`) | âœ… Approved with follow-up | Messaging aligns with professional-but-approachable tone; flagged need for professional FR review (handoff to translation vendor initiated separately). |

- Selected copy variations communicated to marketing for final edits (Variation B for banner headline, CTA, email subject, blog subhead, inventory tooltip).
- Noted requirement to attach matching evidence links when PRs reference OCC-301/OCC-305 stories.

### Next Actions
- Coordinate with marketing and designer on FR translation review kickoff (tracked under OCC-215/OCC-305 follow-ups).
- Share backlog + ownership summary in #occ-product and ensure agents acknowledge before daily sync.

## 2025-10-08 â€” Operator Training Dry Run Coordination
- Support requested confirmation on the 2025-10-16 @ 13:00 ET dry run slot and staging access handoff; see `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md:214` for prep checklist. Awaiting response to proceed with invites.

## Action Request â€” 2025-10-07
- Review marketing deliverables outlined in `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md`.
- Select preferred copy variations (banner CTA/headline, launch email subject, blog subhead, tooltip variant) and provide approval or redlines.
- Confirm production launch window so marketing can schedule comms distribution and support can lock training.

## Dependencies

- Translation review engagement (`docs/marketing/translation_review_request_2025-10-07.md`).
