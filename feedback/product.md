4. Q&A (20 min)
5. Next steps (10 min)

**Materials**:
- Training slides (PDF)
- Quick reference guide (1-page)
- FAQ document

### Risk Mitigation (5 Risks)

1. **Operator resistance**: Select early adopters, emphasize "assists not replaces", collect feedback daily
2. **Low AI accuracy**: Start with high-automation only, monitor daily, iterate on prompts
3. **Approval queue bottleneck**: Target <60s latency, optimize UI, train on shortcuts
4. **Technical issues**: Test in staging, engineer on-call, P0 bugs <2h fix
5. **Pilot operator churn**: Select satisfied operators, provide support, offer opt-out
