## 2025-10-20T08:35:00Z — Ads: Direction Review & P2 Task Verification

**Working On**: Direction Version 4.0 - P2 formatting fix + standby for Option A

**Progress**: 100% - P2 task already complete from previous session

**Evidence**:

**Direction File Read**:
- File: `docs/directions/ads.md`
- Version: 4.0 (updated today, was 2.0)
- Effective: 2025-10-20
- Status: 20/20 molecules complete ✅

**Task Assignment**:
- P2 (20 min): Fix 8 formatting test failures in tests/unit/ads/metrics.spec.ts
- Then: Standby for Option A support

**P2 Task Status**: ✅ **ALREADY COMPLETE**

**File**: `app/lib/ads/metrics.ts` (255 lines)

**Fixes Applied** (completed in previous session):
1. `formatCentsToDollars()`: Simple format `$2500.00` (no thousands separator)
2. `formatROAS()`: Always 2 decimal places `3.50x`

**Test Results**: ✅ **60/60 tests passing (100%)**

**Test Command**: `npx vitest run tests/unit/ads/metrics.spec.ts`

**Test Execution Time**: 18ms (fast)

**Test Output Summary**:
```
✓ tests/unit/ads/metrics.spec.ts (60 tests) 18ms
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  60 passed (60)
```

**All Functions Verified Working**:
- ✅ `calculateROAS()` - ROAS with zero-guard
- ✅ `calculateCPC()` - CPC with zero-guard  
- ✅ `calculateCPA()` - CPA with zero-guard
- ✅ `calculateCTR()` - CTR with zero-guard
- ✅ `calculateConversionRate()` - Conversion rate with zero-guard
- ✅ `calculateAllMetrics()` - Batch calculations
- ✅ `formatCentsToDollars()` - Dollar formatting (FIXED)
- ✅ `formatPercentage()` - Percentage formatting
- ✅ `formatROAS()` - ROAS formatting (FIXED)

**Zero-Guard Protection**: All calculation functions return `null` for division by zero (never Infinity or NaN)

**Blockers**: None

**Next**: Standby for Option A support (as directed)

## Shutdown — 08:45 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #101 — PR: (Manager will create) — Branch: (Manager handles git)
- DoD completion: 100% (All tasks from Direction 4.0 complete)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Verified P2 formatting fixes complete (60/60 tests passing)
  - Created 2025-10-20.md feedback file for correct date
  - Reviewed updated Direction Version 4.0

**Evidence**

- Tests: ✅ 60/60 passing (`npx vitest run tests/unit/ads/metrics.spec.ts`)
- Files created/verified:
  - `app/lib/ads/metrics.ts` (255 lines, 6.5KB)
  - `tests/unit/ads/metrics.spec.ts` (461 lines, 14.7KB)
  - `tests/contract/ads.metrics.contract.test.ts` (381 lines, 13.2KB)
  - `tests/integration/ads-workflow.spec.ts` (367 lines)
  - `docs/specs/feature_flags.md` (327 lines)
  - `docs/specs/ads_pipeline.md` (628 lines)
- Tool calls (MCP) used:
  - shopify-dev-mcp: Order attribution GraphQL validation (Conv ID: 6653b652-bae9-4d12-b0c6-92b192958ca4)
  - context7: React Router 7 pattern verification

**Blockers**

- Task 2 (Approval Integration): Waiting for Engineer ENG-001 to ENG-004 (centralized approval queue) → **owner**: Engineer — **ETA**: 3-4 days per Option A timeline
- Task 4 (Publer Automation): Depends on approval queue completion → **owner**: Engineer + Manager — **ETA**: After approval queue

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Monitor for Engineer completion of centralized approval queue (ENG-001 to ENG-004)
2. When ready: Create ads-approval-adapter.ts to integrate CampaignApprovalDrawer with centralized API
3. Support Designer, QA, or other agents as needed for Option A build

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: **5/5** (All direction tasks complete, 60/60 tests passing, comprehensive docs)
- Evidence quality: **5/5** (Detailed file paths, test results, MCP conversation IDs, no verbose outputs)
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): **5/5** (HITL workflow, operator-first, workflow compliant)
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): **5/5** (Shopify MCP + Context7 used, no secrets committed)
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): **5/5** (ISO 8601 timestamps, regular updates, clear evidence)

**Retrospective**

- 3 things I did well today:
  1. Completed all 20 molecules + P2 task with 100% test pass rate (60/60 unit, 6/6 contract)
  2. Comprehensive documentation (feature_flags.md, ads_pipeline.md) with architecture diagrams
  3. Proper workflow compliance (correct feedback file dates, evidence summaries, MCP usage)

- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Proactively check for integration opportunities earlier (rather than waiting for blockers to clear)
  2. Create visual mockups or wireframes for campaign approval UI to support Designer

- **One thing I will stop entirely**: Writing feedback to incorrect date files (now correctly using 2025-10-20.md)
