# Ads — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary
- Slice A (metrics files 1–6) merged with ROAS/CPC smoke tests; Slice B/C staged for production rollout.
- Approvals drawer wired to centralized evidence payloads; Publer export automation ready behind HITL flag.
- Playwright suite green after CI fixes; tracking remaining repo fmt/lint debt with DevOps.

## Production Launch Checklist
- [x] Dashboard tiles validated with Supabase mocks
- [ ] Slice B diff ≤50 files with tests + docs
- [ ] Slice C diff ≤50 files with alerts + rollback notes
- [ ] Publer export logging final review

## Evidence
```bash
npx vitest run tests/unit/ads/tracking.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e
```
- Supabase dashboard queries logged in `artifacts/ops/ads_metrics_2025-10-17.ndjson`

## Blockers / Risks
- Awaiting Meta/Google credential approval for live ROAS feeds (mocked in tests)
- Repo-wide lint/fmt debt; coordinate with DevOps before merge window

## Next Steps
1. Land Slice B PR with CPA/CVR pacing helpers and dashboards updated.
2. Coordinate with Analytics on live credential rollout plan.
3. Follow up on Publer automation review before enabling feature flag.
