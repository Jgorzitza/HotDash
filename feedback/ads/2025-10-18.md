# Ads — Feedback — 2025-10-18

## Startup Trace
- 2025-10-18T23:17:11-06:00: `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json` missing → logged follow-up in tasks tracker.
- 2025-10-19T00:35:00-06:00: Located `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json`; file lacks `ads` lane entry, blocking molecule execution.
- 2025-10-18T23:19:29-06:00: Blocker artifact recorded at `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/BLOCKER_lanes.json`.
- 2025-10-18T23:20:02-06:00: Audited repo; `app/lib/ads`, `tests/unit/ads`, `app/routes/api.ads.*` absent.
- 2025-10-18T23:21:21-06:00: Logged MCP plan `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/mcp/ads_metrics_plan.jsonl` covering evidence + command flow.
- 2025-10-18T23:23:15-06:00: `resume --force --mode checklist --verify all` failed (`resume` binary missing).
- 2025-10-18T23:45:28-06:00: `tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh` not found while attempting gated resume command.

## 1. Current Status
- **State:** Idle (blocked)
- **Most recent verified output:** `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/mcp/ads_metrics_plan.jsonl`
- **Dependencies remaining:**
  - Ads lane definition within `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json`
  - Confirmed location/creation plan for ads code surfaces (`app/lib/ads/**`, `tests/unit/ads/**`, `app/routes/api.ads.*`)
  - Availability of `tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh` wrapper or replacement command

## 2. Blockers / Risks
- **Description:** Lane manifest lacks ads lane (`reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json`)
  - **Root cause:** Manifest contains analytics/engineer/manager lanes only; no ads molecules defined
  - **Attempted fix / evidence path:** Blocker artifact `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/BLOCKER_lanes.json`; manifest verified in `Startup Trace`
  - **Owner:** Manager
  - **ETA:** Awaiting manager direction

- **Description:** Ads code directories referenced in DoD do not exist
  - **Root cause:** Repo lacks `app/lib/ads`, `tests/unit/ads`, `app/routes/api.ads.*`
  - **Attempted fix / evidence path:** Repo audit noted in `Startup Trace`; `git status -sb` snapshot confirms absence
  - **Owner:** Manager / Engineering lead
  - **ETA:** Pending guidance

- **Description:** `tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh` script missing (cannot execute mandated gated resume command)
  - **Root cause:** Script path does not exist in `tools/policy`
  - **Attempted fix / evidence path:** Failure logged in `Startup Trace`
  - **Owner:** Manager / DevOps
  - **ETA:** Pending tool availability

## 3. Next Intent (Self-Proposed Plan)
1. As soon as ads molecules are provided, execute first item via heartbeat wrapper and log MCP evidence without delay.
2. Scaffold ads metrics module (`app/lib/ads/**`) with ROAS/CPC helpers aligned to Issue #101 once directory strategy is confirmed.
3. Build accompanying Vitest coverage under `tests/unit/ads/**` and update artifacts/feedback with test logs.
4. Re-run gated resume command using the correct `run_with_gates` script/path to verify checklist compliance when tool is available.

## 4. Required Input from Manager
- Add ads lane molecules to `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json` or provide alternate queue.
- Confirm creation plan/path for ads code surfaces (new folders vs. alternate locations).
- Supply correct path or replacement for `tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh`.

## 5. Performance Snapshot
- **Score:** 2
- **Reasons:** Started day aligned with directives, captured MCP plan and blockers promptly, but progress is halted pending missing lane file, directories, and tooling.

## 6. Evidence Links
- MCP Evidence: `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/mcp/runbook_start.jsonl`
- MCP Evidence: `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/mcp/ads_metrics_plan.jsonl`
- Blocker Record: `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/BLOCKER_lanes.json`
- Task Tracker: `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/tasks.todo.json`

### Shutdown — 00:41 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #101 — PR: n/a — Branch: batch-20251019/analytics-m10403-export
- DoD completion: 10% (blocked pending ads lane + directories)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Located lane manifest but confirmed absence of ads molecules; blocker updated.
  - Refreshed tasks tracker and blocker artifact with current findings.
  - Attempted GitHub shutdown comment (`gh issue comment 101 ...`) — failed (Issue #101 not found for current repo).

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/tasks.todo.json`, `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/BLOCKER_lanes.json`
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: Logged in `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/mcp/runbook_start.jsonl`, `artifacts/ads/2025-10-18/mcp/ads_metrics_plan.jsonl`

**Blockers**

- Ads lane missing from `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json` → **owner**: Manager — **ETA**: Awaiting update
- Ads code directories absent (`app/lib/ads/**`, etc.) → **owner**: Engineering/Manager — **ETA**: Pending guidance
- `tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh` script missing → **owner**: DevOps — **ETA**: Pending tooling fix

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Execute first provided ads molecule with heartbeat logging immediately after lane file is updated.
2. Scaffold ads metrics module once directory strategy is confirmed and log MCP evidence before code changes.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 2
- Evidence quality: 4
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 4
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 3

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Captured MCP evidence and blockers before attempting code changes.
  2. Maintained feedback and artifacts with precise timestamps.
  3. Escalated missing assets immediately.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Double-check lane manifests earlier via `find` to avoid stale assumptions.
  2. Pre-verify policy scripts availability before relying on them.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Assuming directories exist without verifying in repo first.
