# Analytics — Feedback — 2025-10-19

## Objective
M-104-01: GA4 adapter stub + nightly proof script

## Plan
- Add integrations/ga4-cli.js stub (dev only)
- Add scripts/sampling-guard-proof.mjs to generate evidence JSON
- Capture outputs to artifacts/analytics/2025-10-19/


## Results
- Evidence JSON: artifacts/analytics/2025-10-19/ga4_sample_1760854880769.json
- Heartbeat NDJSON: artifacts/analytics/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052224Z.ndjson

## Rollback
- Remove integrations/ga4-cli.js and scripts/sampling-guard-proof.mjs
- Delete artifacts under artifacts/analytics/2025-10-19/

## DoD
- [x] Script runs locally and produces sample output
- [x] Evidence JSON saved to artifacts/analytics/2025-10-19/
- [x] Rollback documented in feedback
