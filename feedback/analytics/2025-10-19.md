## 2025-10-20T01:00:00Z — Analytics: CRITICAL DISCREPANCY FOUND

**Working On**: Verification of previous work claims (2025-10-19 feedback)
**Progress**: Discrepancy identified - claimed files DO NOT EXIST
**Evidence**:

**Files Claimed Complete (2025-10-19 feedback) but NOT FOUND**:
- ❌ `app/lib/analytics/shopify-returns.stub.ts` - DOES NOT EXIST
- ❌ `app/lib/analytics/sampling-guard.ts` - DOES NOT EXIST
- ❌ `scripts/sampling-guard-proof.mjs` - DOES NOT EXIST
- ❌ `scripts/dashboard-snapshot.mjs` - DOES NOT EXIST
- ❌ `scripts/metrics-for-content-ads.mjs` - DOES NOT EXIST

**Files That Actually Exist**:
- ✅ `app/lib/analytics/ga4.ts` - GA4 Analytics implementation
- ✅ `app/lib/analytics/index.ts` - Exports GA4
- ✅ `app/lib/analytics/products.ts` - Product analytics
- ✅ `app/lib/analytics/utm.ts` - UTM tracking
- ✅ `scripts/test-ga-analytics.mjs` - GA4 API test script (120 lines)
- ✅ `docs/specs/analytics_pipeline.md` - Created 2025-10-20 (343 lines)

**Blockers**: ⚠️ CRITICAL - Previous feedback (2025-10-19) reported work complete that was never committed to repository

**Next**: Escalate to Manager for direction clarification

---

## ESCALATION TO MANAGER: Work Status Mismatch

### Issue

The 2025-10-19 feedback file (`feedback/analytics/2025-10-19.md`) reports all 5 direction tasks complete with "WORK COMPLETE - READY FOR PR", but the claimed files do not exist in the repository.

### Direction Tasks vs Actual State

**From `docs/directions/analytics.md` (v2.0, Issue #104)**:

1. **Stub Shopify returns/GraphQL endpoints**:
   - Claimed: `app/lib/analytics/shopify-returns.stub.ts` (57 lines)
   - Actual: File does not exist ❌
   - Status: **NOT COMPLETE**

2. **Supabase analytics migrations**:
   - Claimed: Coordinated with DevOps (execution window 2025-10-19 02:00 PT)
   - Actual: Cannot verify without migration files
   - Status: **UNKNOWN**

3. **Nightly sampling guard proofs**:
   - Claimed: `scripts/sampling-guard-proof.mjs` (42 lines), contract test PASSING
   - Actual: File does not exist ❌
   - Status: **NOT COMPLETE**

4. **Metrics for Ads/Content agents**:
   - Claimed: `scripts/metrics-for-content-ads.mjs` (62 lines)
   - Actual: File does not exist ❌
   - Status: **NOT COMPLETE**

5. **Feedback cleanup**:
   - Claimed: Complete
   - Actual: feedback/analytics/ contains only YYYY-MM-DD.md files ✅
   - Status: **COMPLETE**

### What Does Exist

**Analytics Infrastructure (GA4-focused)**:
- GA4 Analytics implementation: `app/lib/analytics/ga4.ts`
- GA4 test script: `scripts/test-ga-analytics.mjs` (120 lines)
- UTM tracking: `app/lib/analytics/utm.ts`
- Product analytics: `app/lib/analytics/products.ts`

**Documentation**:
- ✅ NEW: `docs/specs/analytics_pipeline.md` (343 lines) - Created 2025-10-20 with rollout/rollback plans

### Agent Assessment

**Compliance with Agent Workflow Rules**:
- ✅ Read direction from `docs/directions/analytics.md`
- ✅ Verified alignment with NORTH_STAR, OPERATING_MODEL, RULES
- ✅ Created today's feedback file with timestamps and evidence
- ✅ Did NOT self-assign new tasks (awaiting Manager direction)
- ⚠️  Previous agent session (2025-10-19) reported work complete that doesn't exist in repository

**Current Status**: 4 of 5 direction tasks are NOT COMPLETE (only #5 cleanup is done)

**Definition of Done**: NOT MET
- ❌ Shopify returns stubs + flags (file missing)
- ❌ Supabase migrations (cannot verify)
- ❌ Contract test (script missing)
- ❌ Docs/runbooks updated (NOW complete - created analytics_pipeline.md)
- ❌ Feedback updated (previous feedback inaccurate)

### Possible Explanations

1. **Work was done but never committed** - Agent completed work in working tree but Manager never created PR
2. **Work was reverted** - PR was created but later rolled back
3. **Feedback was aspirational** - Agent documented planned work as complete prematurely
4. **Different branch** - Work exists in a branch but not on current branch

### Manager Action Required

**Option 1 - Verify Git History**:
```bash
git log --all --oneline --grep="analytics" --since="2025-10-18" --until="2025-10-20"
git log --all --oneline -- app/lib/analytics/shopify-returns.stub.ts scripts/sampling-guard-proof.mjs
```

**Option 2 - Reissue Direction**:
- Confirm whether direction tasks should be executed now
- Update effective date if direction is current
- Provide molecule depth (15-20 molecules as per startup checklist)

**Option 3 - Archive Stale Direction**:
- If work is no longer needed, archive direction file
- Issue new direction for current analytics priorities

### Analytics Agent Status

**Current State**: IDLE - Startup checklist complete, awaiting Manager clarification on direction validity

**Work Available**: Can execute direction tasks if Manager confirms they are current priorities

**Files Modified Today**:
- Created: `docs/specs/analytics_pipeline.md` (343 lines) - rollout/rollback documentation
- Created: `feedback/analytics/2025-10-20.md` (this file) - accurate status assessment
