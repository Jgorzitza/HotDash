## 2025-10-21T16:55:00Z — Inventory: INVENTORY-016 COMPLETE ✅

**Working On**: INVENTORY-016 - Vendor Service Enhancement (COMPLETED)

**Progress**: 100% - All functions implemented, tested, passing

**Evidence**:

### Context7 MCP Usage ✅ (MANDATORY)
```
Tool: context7
Doc: /prisma/docs
Topic: relations aggregations transactions count findMany include orderBy
Tokens: 8000
Purpose: Learn Prisma patterns for vendor service implementation
Evidence file: artifacts/inventory/2025-10-21/mcp/vendor-alc.jsonl
```

**Key learnings applied**:
- Relations: `include`, `select` with nested queries
- Aggregations: `_count` for relationship counts  
- Separate queries: PurchaseOrder by vendorId (no direct relation in schema)
- Ordering: `orderBy` with descending sort
- Decimal handling: Convert Prisma Decimal to Number

### Service Created ✅
**File**: `app/services/inventory/vendor-service.ts` (270 lines)

**Functions implemented**:
1. `getVendorWithMetrics(vendorId)` - Get vendor with calculated reliability score, avg lead time, recent POs
2. `updateVendorReliability(vendorId, expectedDate, actualDate)` - Update counters on PO receipt (1 day grace period)
3. `getBestVendorForProduct(variantId, criteria)` - Select best vendor by cost/speed/reliability
4. `getVendorOptions(variantId?)` - Format vendor dropdown with "Name (92% reliable, 7d lead, $24.99/unit)"
5. `getVendorReliabilityTiers()` - Count vendors by tier (excellent/good/fair/poor)

**Algorithm highlights**:
- Reliability score: `(onTimeDeliveries / totalOrders) * 100` rounded to 2 decimals
- Grace period: 1 day (deliveries within 1 day late still count as on-time)
- Best vendor sorting: Cost (ascending), Speed (ascending), Reliability (descending)
- Avg lead time: Calculated from recent 10 POs with actual delivery dates

### Tests Created ✅
**File**: `tests/unit/services/inventory/vendor-service.spec.ts` (420 lines, 14 tests)

**Test coverage**:
- ✅ getVendorWithMetrics: 3 tests (with metrics, null vendor, no orders)
- ✅ updateVendorReliability: 3 tests (on time, late, grace period)
- ✅ getBestVendorForProduct: 4 tests (reliability/cost/speed, no vendors)
- ✅ getVendorOptions: 3 tests (format, all vendors, no cost)
- ✅ getVendorReliabilityTiers: 1 test (categorization)

**Test results**: ✅ All 14 tests passing

### Linting ✅
- No linter errors in vendor-service.ts
- No linter errors in vendor-service.spec.ts
- TypeScript compilation clean

### Integration Points
- Database: Vendor, VendorProductMapping, PurchaseOrder tables
- Called from: INVENTORY-018 (receiving workflow - updateVendorReliability)
- Called from: Engineer UI (vendor dropdown - getVendorOptions)
- Called from: Emergency sourcing (getBestVendorForProduct)

**Definition of Done - INVENTORY-016**: ✅ ALL COMPLETE
- [x] Vendor service enhanced with 4+ new functions
- [x] Reliability scoring implemented (0-100%)
- [x] Best vendor selection logic (cost/speed/reliability)
- [x] Unit tests passing (14/14 tests, 100% coverage for new functions)
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Context7 MCP docs pulled before implementation
- [x] Evidence logged to JSONL

**Time Spent**: ~45 minutes (ahead of 3h estimate)

**Blockers**: None

**Next**: Start INVENTORY-017 (ALC Calculation Service) immediately
