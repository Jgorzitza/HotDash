### üîç Current State Check

**Date Confirmed**: Monday, October 20, 2025 ‚úÖ

**Branch Status**: 
- Branch: `inventory/oct19-rop-fix-payouts-csv`
- Status: **NOT merged** to main
- Migrations: `20251020190500_inventory_tables.sql` + `20251020190600_inventory_rls.sql`
- Check: `ls supabase/migrations/2025102019*` ‚Üí **NOT FOUND** on main

**Blocker**: Cannot execute post-merge verification until Manager merges branch

---

### ‚è≥ Post-Merge Verification Plan (10 minutes)

**When Manager merges branch**, I will execute:

1. **Verify migrations applied** (2 min):
   ```bash
   cd ~/HotDash/hot-dash
   ls -la supabase/migrations/20251020190500_inventory_tables.sql
   ls -la supabase/migrations/20251020190600_inventory_rls.sql
   git log --oneline -5 | grep inventory
   ```

2. **Run contract test** (3 min):
   ```bash
   npx vitest run tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts
   ```
   Expected: ALL tests passing (16 payout tests including contract tests)

3. **Run full test suite** (3 min):
   ```bash
   npm run test:ci
   ```
   Expected: All inventory tests passing

4. **Verify RLS tests can now run** (2 min):
   ```bash
   # Confirm Data Agent can now test all 12 tables (4 P0 + 8 inventory)
   grep -A 10 "INVENTORY TABLES" supabase/rls_tests.sql
   ```

5. **Update feedback** with results

### Assessment

**Status**: **PARTIAL MERGE** - Commit message claims 8 tables, but:
- Git history: ‚úÖ 8 tables exist in commit 9d0baa4
- Working directory: ‚ùå Only `inventory_actions` (1 table) on disk
- Manager note: Git sync issue being resolved

**Cannot Execute**:
- ‚ùå Contract test (files not on disk)
- ‚ùå Full test suite (files not on disk)
- ‚ùå Service verification (files not on disk)

**Can Confirm**:
- ‚úÖ Git history has 8-table migrations in commit 9d0baa4
- ‚úÖ New `inventory_actions` table with RLS is on disk
- ‚úÖ RLS tests updated to expect 12 tables (4 P0 + 8 inventory)

### Conclusion

**Manager resolving git sync issue**. 8 inventory tables exist in git history but not yet in working directory. **Moving to STANDBY** as directed while Manager resolves sync.
