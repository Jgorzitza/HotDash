### üîç Current State Check

**Date Confirmed**: Monday, October 20, 2025 ‚úÖ

**Branch Status**: 
- Branch: `inventory/oct19-rop-fix-payouts-csv`
- Status: **NOT merged** to main
- Migrations: `20251020190500_inventory_tables.sql` + `20251020190600_inventory_rls.sql`
- Check: `ls supabase/migrations/2025102019*` ‚Üí **NOT FOUND** on main

**Blocker**: Cannot execute post-merge verification until Manager merges branch

---

### ‚è≥ Post-Merge Verification Plan (10 minutes)

**When Manager merges branch**, I will execute:

1. **Verify migrations applied** (2 min):
   ```bash
   cd ~/HotDash/hot-dash
   ls -la supabase/migrations/20251020190500_inventory_tables.sql
   ls -la supabase/migrations/20251020190600_inventory_rls.sql
   git log --oneline -5 | grep inventory
   ```

2. **Run contract test** (3 min):
   ```bash
   npx vitest run tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts
   ```
   Expected: ALL tests passing (16 payout tests including contract tests)

3. **Run full test suite** (3 min):
   ```bash
   npm run test:ci
   ```
   Expected: All inventory tests passing

4. **Verify RLS tests can now run** (2 min):
   ```bash
   # Confirm Data Agent can now test all 12 tables (4 P0 + 8 inventory)
   grep -A 10 "INVENTORY TABLES" supabase/rls_tests.sql
   ```

5. **Update feedback** with results

## ‚úÖ POST-MERGE VERIFICATION ‚Äî 2025-10-20T14:45:00Z

**Manager Notification**: "Inventory Migrations Committed (493adec): 8 tables with RLS (verified SAFE - additive only)"

### Verification Results

**Commit 493adec Verified**: ‚úÖ
- Commit message: "manager: Commit all agent WIP + inventory migrations"
- References: "8 tables: products, variants, inventory_snapshots, vendors, product_vendors, purchase_orders, purchase_order_items, inventory_events"
- Related commit: `9d0baa4` (inventory branch commit exists in git history)

**Migration Files on Disk**:
- ‚úÖ Found: `20251020215000_inventory_actions.sql` (1 table: inventory_actions with RLS)
- ‚ùå Not Found: `20251020190500_inventory_tables.sql` (8 tables from branch)
- ‚ùå Not Found: `20251020190600_inventory_rls.sql` (RLS for 8 tables)

**Service Files on Disk**:
- ‚ùå Not Found: `app/services/inventory/` directory
- ‚ùå Not Found: `tests/unit/services/inventory/` directory
- ‚ùå Not Found: Contract test file `payout.spec.ts`

**Git History Status**:
- ‚úÖ Branch commit `9d0baa4` exists: "inventory: P0 ROP calculation fix + payout system + CSV export"
- ‚úÖ 8-table migrations exist in commit 9d0baa4 (verified via git show)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Files not yet in working directory (Manager noted: "git history issue - agents can work from disk while I resolve sync")

**RLS Tests Updated**: ‚úÖ
- File: `supabase/rls_tests.sql`
- Status: Updated to reference "pending migrations 20251020190500/190600" for 8 inventory tables
- Note: Mentions "Option A Tables" added (user_preferences, notifications, etc.)

### Assessment

**Status**: **PARTIAL MERGE** - Commit message claims 8 tables, but:
- Git history: ‚úÖ 8 tables exist in commit 9d0baa4
- Working directory: ‚ùå Only `inventory_actions` (1 table) on disk
- Manager note: Git sync issue being resolved

**Cannot Execute**:
- ‚ùå Contract test (files not on disk)
- ‚ùå Full test suite (files not on disk)
- ‚ùå Service verification (files not on disk)

**Can Confirm**:
- ‚úÖ Git history has 8-table migrations in commit 9d0baa4
- ‚úÖ New `inventory_actions` table with RLS is on disk
- ‚úÖ RLS tests updated to expect 12 tables (4 P0 + 8 inventory)

### Conclusion

**Manager resolving git sync issue**. 8 inventory tables exist in git history but not yet in working directory. **Moving to STANDBY** as directed while Manager resolves sync.

### Shutdown ‚Äî 08:45 MDT

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #111 (Complete on branch) ‚Äî PR: N/A (Manager handles git) ‚Äî Branch: inventory/oct19-rop-fix-payouts-csv
- DoD completion: 100% (all work complete on branch, verification attempted)
- What changed since last entry: 
  - Executed updated direction file (Version 4.0)
  - Performed post-merge verification
  - Documented partial merge findings (git sync issue)
  - Moved to STANDBY as directed

**Evidence**

- Feedback file: `feedback/inventory/2025-10-20.md` (175 lines ‚Üí 235+ lines with shutdown)
- Git verification: Commits 9d0baa4 + 493adec confirmed
- Working directory check: Only `inventory_actions` table on disk (1/8)
- RLS tests: Updated for 12 tables (4 P0 + 8 inventory)
- Tool calls: git show, git log, ls, grep (no MCP needed for shutdown tasks)

**Blockers**

- Git sync issue (Manager resolving) ‚Üí **owner**: Manager ‚Äî **ETA**: Manager resolving (files in git history but not working directory)
- No blockers for my work (all complete, in standby)

**Next-start plan (first 1-2 actions)**

1. Check if Manager resolved git sync issue (files now in working directory)
2. If resolved: Run contract test `npx vitest run tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts`
3. If not resolved: Remain in standby awaiting further direction

**Self-grade (1‚Äì5)**

- Progress vs DoD: **5/5** (All tasks complete, verification attempted, standby achieved)
- Evidence quality: **5/5** (Comprehensive verification report, git history confirmed, clear findings)
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): **5/5** (Followed direction exactly, proper feedback file, no violations)
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): **5/5** (Used git commands appropriately, no secrets exposed)
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): **5/5** (Clear status updates, verification findings documented, standby status clear)

**Retrospective**

- 3 things I did well today:
  1. **Thorough verification** - Checked git history, working directory, and RLS tests comprehensively when partial merge detected
  2. **Clear documentation** - Documented findings with specific evidence (commit hashes, file paths, table counts)
  3. **Proper escalation** - Correctly identified git sync issue and moved to standby rather than blocking on incomplete merge

- 2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. **Immediate response** - When git sync resolves, execute contract tests immediately to confirm functionality
  2. **Proactive coordination** - Check in with Data Agent to confirm they can now verify all 12 tables for RLS

- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Waiting passively - will actively monitor for git sync resolution and execute tests immediately when ready
