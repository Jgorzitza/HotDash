**Working On**: INV-000-P0: Fix ROP Calculation Off-by-1 Error

**Progress**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Created safety stock calculation library (`app/lib/inventory/safety-stock.ts`)
- Created ROP calculation service (`app/services/inventory/rop.ts`)
- Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/unit/services/inventory/rop.spec.ts`)
- All 14 tests passing (14/14)
- Test at line 178 correctly returns 43 (expected value)

**Evidence**:
- Files created:
  - app/lib/inventory/safety-stock.ts (47 lines)
  - app/services/inventory/rop.ts (86 lines)
  - tests/unit/services/inventory/rop.spec.ts (227 lines)
- Test results: `npx vitest run tests/unit/services/inventory/rop.spec.ts`
  - ✓ 14 tests passed in 1.42s
  - Critical test case (line 178): ROP = 43 ✓
- Formula implemented:
  - ROP = avg_daily_usage × lead_time + safety_stock
  - Safety stock = (max_daily_sales × max_lead_days) - (avg_daily_sales × avg_lead_days)
  - Proper rounding with Math.ceil to avoid off-by-1 error
