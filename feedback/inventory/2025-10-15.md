# Inventory Agent Feedback — 2025-10-15

## Today's Objective Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Direction File:** `docs/directions/inventory.md` v2.0  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Branch:** `agent/inventory/schema-design`  
**Priority:** P1 - Schema Design

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Created Inventory Data Model Specification ✅

**File:** `docs/specs/inventory_data_model.md` (429 lines)

**Sections Delivered:**
- ✅ ROP Calculation formula and fields
- ✅ Status buckets (in_stock, low_stock, urgent_reorder, out_of_stock)
- ✅ Kit/bundle structure (tag-based and metafield-based)
- ✅ Picker payout brackets (answered manager's question)
- ✅ Shopify metafields vs Supabase delineation
- ✅ 6 Supabase tables defined with relationships
- ✅ Data flow and integration patterns

### 2. Created Shopify Metafields Integration Guide ✅

**File:** `docs/integrations/shopify_inventory_metafields.md` (568 lines)

**Sections Delivered:**
- ✅ Metafields fundamentals and namespace conventions
- ✅ Proposed schema: 8 core metafields in `app.inventory` namespace
- ✅ Complete GraphQL query and mutation examples
- ✅ Tag-based fallback strategy
- ✅ Implementation checklist and best practices

### 3. Coordinated with Data Agent ✅

**Data Agent Branch:** `agent/data/schema-foundation` - EXISTS

**Findings:**
- Data agent uses pattern: main table + line items (e.g., `approvals` + `approval_items`)
- Uses JSONB for flexible structures
- Includes proper indexes, foreign keys, and rollback migrations
- My spec follows same pattern for consistency

**Alignment:**
- My `picker_payouts` + `picker_payout_lines` matches their pattern
- Ready for data agent to implement migrations from my spec

## Manager's Question Answered

**Question:** What are the payout brackets?

**Answer:** Defined in Section 4.3 of `inventory_data_model.md`

**Picker Payout Brackets (Per Order):**
| Pick Quantity | Payout per Order | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| 1-4 pieces | $2.00 | Small orders |
| 5-10 pieces | $4.00 | Medium orders |
| 11+ pieces | $7.00 | Large orders |

**Important:** Payout is a flat amount per order based on total pick quantity, not per-piece.

**Calculation Examples:**
- Order with 2 pieces → $2.00
- Order with 8 pieces → $4.00
- Order with 47 pieces → $7.00

**CORRECTED 2025-10-15:** Original spec had incorrect per-piece rates. Fixed to per-order flat amounts.

## Key Deliverables Summary

### ROP Formula
```
ROP = (Average Daily Sales × Lead Time Days) + Safety Stock
```

**Fields Required:**
- `lead_time_days` - From Shopify metafield `app.inventory.lead_time_days` (default: 14)
- `safety_stock` - From metafield or calculated
- `sales_velocity_30d` - Calculated from Shopify orders
- `current_stock` - From Shopify `inventoryQuantity`

### Status Buckets
- `in_stock`: Quantity > ROP
- `low_stock`: ROP ≥ Quantity > (ROP × 0.5)
- `urgent_reorder`: (ROP × 0.5) ≥ Quantity > 0
- `out_of_stock`: Quantity = 0

### Shopify Metafields (app.inventory namespace)
1. `lead_time_days` (number_integer)
2. `safety_stock` (number_integer)
3. `is_bundle` (boolean)
4. `pack_count` (number_integer)
5. `picker_payout_rate` (number_decimal)
6. `reorder_point_override` (number_integer)
7. `vendor_sku` (single_line_text_field)
8. `min_order_quantity` (number_integer)

### Supabase Tables
1. `products` - Product master with metafield values
2. `inventory_snapshots` - Point-in-time inventory + calculations
3. `sales_velocity` - Historical sales for ROP calculation
4. `picker_payouts` - Payout summary records
5. `picker_payout_lines` - Line item detail
6. `reorder_suggestions` - Generated PO recommendations

## Questions for Manager

1. **Payout Brackets:** Should we implement bracket-based ($0.10-$0.18) or flat-rate ($0.12) initially?
   - Bracket-based is more complex but rewards volume
   - Flat-rate is simpler to implement and explain

2. **Bundle Components:** Should component tracking (Option 2 in spec) be in initial scope or future enhancement?
   - Option 1 (tag-based, simple): Bundle inventory = product's own inventory
   - Option 2 (component-based): Bundle availability = MIN(component_qty / required_qty)

3. **Metafield Definitions:** Should we create metafield definitions before or after data agent implements schema?
   - Creating definitions first ensures consistency
   - But requires Shopify API access and testing
