- Manager heads-up: Supabase migration guardrails mid-adjustment (added DROP POLICY IF EXISTS across inventory/approvals/analytics migrations, started moving rollback SQL out of auto-run path). `supabase db reset` still failing due to additional existing objects in earlier migrations; halted to avoid further drift until we align on guard strategy. Current diff touches 8 migration files with policy guards; rollback/scripts relocation still pending.
- Refresh: Re-read docs/directions/inventory.md (v2.3) to align before staging check-in.
- Command: `source vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c 'select now();' > artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/ipv4-check.log` → success (timestamp captured in log).
- Attempt: `source vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/seed.sql` → FAIL (`supabase/seed.sql` missing). Gap logged; need owner to restore minimal seed script or update config. Proposing owner: Data (seed upkeep); ETA: request next sync.
- Added `supabase/seed.sql` minimal dataset (seed.hotdash.test) guarding optional tables; reran staging seed: `source vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/seed.sql` → success (log `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/seed.log`). No further gaps observed.
- Check: `supabase db reset --no-seed` (post-seed work) → still fails (`duplicate key value` on `schema_migrations` version 20251011070600). Local supabase_migrations table retains prior entries; need full cleanup or idempotent migration adjustments before reset will pass.
- Manager notice: Supabase `db reset --no-seed` still blocked by duplicate key on migration version `20251011070600`. I paused further edits; awaiting direction on preferred fix (e.g., schema_migrations cleanup vs. making base migrations idempotent). Seed work complete and logs captured.

### Shutdown — 00:42 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #111 — PR: _(n/a)_ — Branch: _(n/a; manager-controlled)_
- DoD completion: ~40% (API/tests validated; migrations still pending guard alignment)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Added staging connectivity log + minimal `supabase/seed.sql`; seed run now succeeds.
  - Attempted `supabase db reset --no-seed`; still blocked by duplicate migration version (reported to manager).
  - Logged manager notice requesting direction on migration guardrail cleanup.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/ipv4-check.log`, `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/seed.log`
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: Supabase MCP startup ping (`artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/startup_mcp_supabase.jsonl`)

**Blockers**

- `supabase db reset --no-seed` fails (duplicate key on migration version `20251011070600`) → **owner:** Manager/Data to define cleanup path — **ETA:** awaiting guidance

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Align with manager on schema migration strategy (idempotent fixes vs. cleanup) and implement agreed changes.
2. Re-run `supabase db reset --no-seed` and `supabase db test supabase/tests/inventory_rls.sql`; extend pgTAP coverage if gaps remain.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 3
- Evidence quality: 5
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 4 (one Supabase MCP call; staging psql run per direction)
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 4

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Restored inventory seed path and captured staging evidence quickly.
  2. Documented blockers and manager notifications inline with direction file expectations.
  3. Validated `/api.inventory.export` integration and ensured feedback artifacts are linked.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Coordinate earlier with Data/manager before refactoring migrations to avoid partial diffs.
  2. Expand pgTAP coverage in tandem with migration edits to confirm policy behavior immediately.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Leaving migration guard adjustments half-applied without an agreed rollback plan.

## 2025-10-18 — Session 2 (started 18:11 local)

### Plan

- Re-skim North Star / Operating Model / Rules to ensure alignment before taking new actions.
- Reconfirm Supabase IPv4 pooler connectivity from staging env and capture fresh log under `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/`.
- Validate minimal seed coverage for inventory + picker payouts; rerun seed if needed and document SQL/results.
- Execute dashboard verification queries (status buckets, ROP, picker payouts) against staging; note expected vs. actual and capture artifacts.
- Capture MCP/command outputs and append findings + follow-ups to this feedback log.

### Execution

- Alignment check: re-read `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`, `docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md`, and `docs/RULES.md` before touching data.
- Connectivity probe: `source vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c 'select now() as connected_at, inet_server_addr() as server_ip;'` → logged to `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/ipv4-check-20251019T001221Z.log` (IPv6 reported). Forcing `hostaddr=3.227.209.82` still returns IPv6 (`ipv4-check-20251019T001343Z.log`); noting with Data to confirm if a dedicated IPv4 endpoint is required.
- Seed refresh: reran `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/seed.sql` and recorded output under `seed-20251019T001738Z.log`; data snapshots captured in `seed-verify-20251019T001532Z.log`.
- Seed tweak: updated `supabase/seed.sql` so `reorder_point` matches `avg_daily_sales * lead_time_days + safety_stock` (now `18` and `30` respectively); reseeded.
- Dashboard checks: executed status bucket / ROP / picker payout queries → results in `dashboard-verify-20251019T001747Z.log` (ROP now matches computed values; picker payout rate $3.00/pc).
- Project details sanity check: `supabase projects list --output json` confirms staging ref `mmbjiyhsvniqxibzgyvx` with database host `db.mmbjiyhsvniqxibzgyvx.supabase.co` (`artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/project-details-20251019T003347Z.json`). Also grabbed IPv4 resolutions via `getent ahostsv4 aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com` → `pooler-dns-20251019T003205Z.log` shows ELB IPv4 targets `18.213.155.45` / `3.227.209.82`.
- NOTE: Running `supabase projects api-keys get ...` surfaced the live anon/service-role keys in shell output; flagged for rotation with manager (treat current keys as compromised).
- Contract test attempt: `npx vitest run tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts` exits with “No test files found” (path doesn’t exist in repo). Logged as gap; need direction on whether to add coverage within allowed paths or adjust contract definition.
- Added timeout guard to seed reruns: inserted `SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '5s'` and `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '2s'` in `supabase/seed.sql` so reapply fails fast instead of hanging; reseed recorded in `seed-20251019T031329Z.log`.

### Findings / Follow-ups

- IPv4 requirement unclear: Supabase pooler still surfaces IPv6 address even when forcing IPv4 hostaddr. Need confirmation whether this satisfies HITL requirement or if vault should hold an explicit IPv4-only URL (owner: Data).
- Picker payout + inventory seeds now aligned with spec; no additional gaps observed in sample data.
- Supabase project metadata already exposes the database host; existing DSN aligns with project ref (no new endpoint required). DNS lookup verifies IPv4 targets even though connections report IPv6 locally.
- Secrets exposure: service/anon JWTs printed during CLI check—requesting immediate rotation (owner: Manager/Data).

### Next Intent

1. Confirm with Data whether additional IPv4-only configuration is needed for Supabase staging pooler.
2. If cleared, proceed to expand dashboard contract tests (ROP/payout) per DoD tomorrow.

### Manager Update (2025-10-18 00:40Z)

- **Issues Logged**
  - Supabase pooler evidence still returns IPv6 addresses (`inet_server_addr`) even when forcing the ELB IPv4 host; current direction wants IPv4 confirmation before closeout.
  - Executing `supabase projects api-keys get ...` during verification exposed the live anon/service-role JWTs in terminal output. Those credentials should be treated as compromised.
  - The contract test path `tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts` referenced in the DoD does not exist, so the mandated `npx vitest run ...` command fails consistently.
- **Requested Manager Actions / Suggested Fixes**
  1. Provide clarity (or an alternate DSN) so we can conclusively prove IPv4 connectivity, or confirm that IPv6 evidence satisfies the DoD.
  2. Rotate the leaked Supabase anon + service-role keys (update vault + GitHub secrets) and advise once replacements are live so future logs stay clean.
  3. Clarify the contract-test expectation: either supply the missing spec file or adjust the DoD so I can complete runs without an unavoidable failure.

### Shutdown — 22:25 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #111 — PR: _(none)_ — Branch: _(n/a; manager-controlled)_
- DoD completion: ~50% (connectivity verified w/ evidence; seeds + dashboard checks updated; contract test + IPv4 confirmation still pending manager inputs)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Added lock/statement timeout guards to `supabase/seed.sql` and revalidated seeding (`seed-20251019T031329Z.log`).
  - Executed formatting pass (`npm run fmt` — no file changes) and attempted lint run (`npm run lint` — fails on existing `any`/unused vars outside allowed scope).
  - Captured heartbeat log and consolidated artifacts for today’s evidence set.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/seed-20251019T031329Z.log`; `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/dashboard-verify-20251019T001747Z.log`; `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/ipv4-check-20251019T002927Z.log`; `npm run fmt` (exit 0, all files unchanged); `npm run lint` (fails on pre-existing lint issues — see console output).
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: Supabase MCP `execute_sql` attempt (unauthorized) — `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/startup_mcp_supabase.jsonl`.
- Foreground Proof: `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/logs/heartbeat.log` (2025-10-19T04:30:41Z, 2025-10-19T04:30:41Z)

**Blockers**

- IPv4 pooler evidence still returns IPv6 — awaiting manager/Data confirmation on acceptable DSN evidence.
- Contract test path missing — requires manager guidance or spec update before test suite can pass.
- Supabase anon/service-role keys exposed by CLI output — rotation needed from manager before further credentialed MCP work.

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Re-run connection probe with updated DSN once Data/manager provide IPv4 guidance; refresh logs/artifacts accordingly.
2. Implement/execute the inventory payout contract test (or alternative) once manager clarifies expected path and scope.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 3
- Evidence quality: 5
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 4 (one Supabase MCP attempt noted; CLI exposure flagged immediately)
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 4

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Captured comprehensive artifacts (seeds, dashboard checks, DNS proof) and documented gaps promptly.
  2. Added timeout safeguards to seed scripts to prevent future hangs during staging runs.
  3. Escalated credential exposure immediately with clear follow-up actions.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Kick off lint/test sweeps earlier to surface cross-lane blockers sooner.
  2. Automate MCP credential loading before evidence calls to avoid unauthorized retries.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Delaying heartbeat/log artifacts until shutdown — will capture mid-session during longer runs.
Status → next intent: Resume molecules per reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json (M-001 first).
