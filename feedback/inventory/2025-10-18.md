# 2025-10-18 — Inventory Agent

## Plan
- Align with NORTH_STAR / OPERATING_MODEL / RULES
- Review direction + Issue #111, confirm Allowed paths and DoD
- Execute lane molecules and capture MCP evidence before any code edits
- Run policy contract + required validations (fmt, lint, test:ci, scan)
- Log progress, blockers, and evidence

## Log 05:13 UTC
- Ran `npm run policy:contracts`; command failed: script not found. Logged npm warning for missing script per runbook.
- Proceeding with available tasks per Autonomy mode.

## Log 05:15 UTC
- Attempted to locate lane file `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json`; file/directory not present. Unable to execute molecules; proceeding with available guidance (direction + plan).

## Log 05:19 UTC
- Created artifacts trackers at `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/` (tasks.todo.{md,json}).
- Captured MCP evidence in `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/mcp/startup.jsonl` and heartbeat entry in `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-18/heartbeat.ndjson`.
- No code changes performed yet; readiness pending actionable molecules/issue guidance.

## Log 05:37 UTC
- Ran `npx vitest run tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts`; command failed because the spec file/path does not exist. Logged heartbeat at `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T053714Z.ndjson`.

### Shutdown — 00:59 MDT

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #111 — PR: n/a — Branch: batch-20251019/lanes-ads-queue-v2
- DoD completion: ~35% (startup artifacts + core calc module/tests in progress; rollout pending)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Added inventory calculation module covering ROP, status buckets, picker payouts, and bundle parsing.
  - Landed accompanying unit specs and validated fmt, lint, test:ci, scan (all via heartbeat-wrapped runs).
  - Logged MCP evidence + heartbeats for fmt/lint/test/scan and documented missing contract spec + lane file gap.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: `artifacts/inventory/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052223Z.ndjson`, `...T053314Z.ndjson`, `...T053509Z.ndjson`, `...T053554Z.ndjson`, `...T053714Z.ndjson`
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: filesystem MCP logs (`artifacts/inventory/2025-10-19/mcp/startup.jsonl`, `fmt.jsonl`, `lint.jsonl`, `testci.jsonl`, `inventory.jsonl`)

**Blockers**

- Contract test path (`tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts`) referenced in direction does not exist → **owner**: manager → **ETA**: needs guidance before next slice
- Lane molecules file was absent during startup; newly appears untracked — waiting for vetted instructions before execution → **owner**: manager → **ETA**: manager confirmation

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Validate lane molecules once canonical `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json` is published and aligned.
2. Extend inventory module into Supabase-facing service (status buckets, persistence) + rework contract test target per manager guidance.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 2
- Evidence quality: 4
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 4
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 3

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Captured heartbeat + MCP evidence for every long-running command per policy.
  2. Staged reusable inventory calculation helpers with test coverage to unblock downstream work.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Confirm lane artifacts earlier (or file blocker sooner) before diving into implementation.
  2. Sync with manager on contract test expectations prior to running targeted vitest slices.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** retrying missing commands (`policy:contracts`, non-existent specs) without first surfacing to manager/issue log.
