# Inventory Agent Feedback — 2025-10-19

## 2025-10-19T02:08:00Z — Inventory: Agent Startup Checklist Completed

**Working On**: Agent startup checklist execution per docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md

**Progress**: Checklist 7/8 steps complete. Step 2 (Tools & Env) blocked by MCP authentication failures.

**Evidence**:
- Direction read: docs/directions/inventory.md v2.0 (Issue #111, objective: inventory intelligence system)
- Alignment verified: NORTH_STAR.md, OPERATING_MODEL.md, RULES.md (direction aligns with M3 roadmap)
- Allowed paths verified: app/services/inventory/ (calculations.ts, types.ts), supabase/migrations/ (11 files), docs/specs/inventory_pipeline.md
- Existing tests found: tests/unit/services/inventory/calculations.spec.ts (195 lines, covers ROP/payout/status)
- MCP tools tested: Shopify MCP ✅ (conversationId: 932fc97c-270a-4c83-a3ba-404a706227ea), Supabase MCP ❌ (auth error), GitHub MCP ❌ (401)
- Contract test mismatch: direction specifies payout.spec.ts (doesn't exist), actual is calculations.spec.ts

**Blockers**:
- CRITICAL: Supabase MCP unauthorized (missing SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN) - cannot access migrations/tables/RLS
- HIGH: GitHub MCP 401 (bad credentials) - cannot access Issue #111 full DoD
- MEDIUM: Contract test path mismatch - direction vs actual filename

**Next**: Use CLI tools (supabase, gh, psql) to bypass MCP blockers and execute DoD checklist

---

## 2025-10-19T02:20:00Z — Inventory: Switching to CLI Tools

**Working On**: DoD execution using CLI tools (bypassing MCP authentication issues)

**Progress**: Starting DoD checklist with direct CLI commands

**Evidence**: Manager advised: "Use CLI if MCP blocked"

**Blockers**: None (bypassing MCP with CLI)

**Next**: Check CLI tool availability → execute DoD items

---

## 2025-10-19T02:22:00Z — Inventory: DoD Execution Progress (CLI Tools)

**Working On**: Definition of Done checklist execution using CLI tools (bypassing MCP blockers)

**Progress**: DoD 5/9 items complete. Contract test passing (15/15), formatting clean, linting has 1 warning (unrelated to inventory). Test suite run canceled.

**Evidence**:
- CLI tools verified: supabase 2.48.3, gh 2.45.0, node v24.9.0, npm, npx, psql
- Supabase migrations status: 7 remote applied, 7 local pending (20251011070600 through 20251011150400)
- GitHub repo identified: Jgorzitza/HotDash (not rydyr/hot-dash as referenced in direction)
- Issue #111: Does not exist in repo (gh CLI error: "Could not resolve to an issue")
- ✅ Contract test: npx vitest run tests/unit/services/inventory/calculations.spec.ts → 15/15 passing (22ms)
- ✅ Formatting: npm run fmt → All files unchanged (no formatting needed)
- ⚠️ Linting: npm run lint → 1 warning in app/routes/api.analytics.traffic.ts (unused 'request' param, unrelated to inventory)
- ❌ CI tests: npm run test:ci → Command canceled by user

**Blockers**:
- Issue #111 does not exist in repo (direction references non-existent issue)
- Test suite run interrupted (need to rerun npm run test:ci)
- 7 local migrations pending application to remote Supabase (need migration plan)
- Contract test filename mismatch still exists (direction says payout.spec.ts, actual is calculations.spec.ts)

**Next**: 
1. Rerun npm run test:ci to completion
2. Run npm run scan per DoD
3. Document migration status and rollout plan
4. Clarify Issue #111 discrepancy with Manager
5. Update docs/specs/inventory_pipeline.md with progress

## Startup Checklist Details

### ✅ Step 0: Align to the Star (60 sec)
- North Star: Embedded Shopify Admin control center, HITL approvals, MCP-first dev
- Operating Model: Signals→Suggestions→Approvals→Actions→Audit→Learn pipeline
- Rules: Docs allow-list, Issue ledger, MCP/SDK-backed calls, HITL for customer-facing
- **Alignment**: ✅ Inventory system is M3 roadmap item, follows HITL/approvals pattern

### ✅ Step 1: Direction & Issue (60 sec)
- Direction: docs/directions/inventory.md v2.0 (effective 2025-10-17)
- Current Issue: #111 (cannot access - GitHub MCP auth failure)
- Objective: Launch inventory intelligence (status buckets, ROP, picker payouts)
- Allowed paths: app/services/inventory/**, supabase/migrations/**, docs/specs/inventory_pipeline.md, feedback/inventory/2025-10-19.md
- Budget: ≤60 min, ≤140k tokens, ≤50 files per PR
- Contract test: npx vitest run tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts

### ⚠️ Step 2: Tools & Env (60-90 sec)
**MCP Tools Status**:
- Shopify MCP: ✅ OPERATIONAL (conversationId: 932fc97c-270a-4c83-a3ba-404a706227ea)
- Supabase MCP: ❌ FAILED - Error: "Unauthorized. Please provide a valid access token to the MCP server via the --access-token flag or SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN."
- GitHub MCP: ❌ FAILED - Error: "GET https://api.github.com/repos/rydyr/hot-dash/issues/111: 401 Bad credentials"

**Escalation Required**: Cannot proceed with migrations without Supabase access

### ✅ Step 3: Sandbox (30 sec)
- Allowed paths exist and accessible
- No branch creation (Manager controls git)
- Work constrained to: app/services/inventory/, supabase/migrations/, docs/specs/, feedback/inventory/

### ✅ Step 4: Feedback Discipline
- Writing only to feedback/inventory/2025-10-19.md
- No ad-hoc documents created
- Not editing other agents' files

### ✅ Step 5: Work Protocol
- MCP-first confirmed (Shopify, Supabase, GitHub servers)
- Issue reference: Fixes #111 (once accessible)
- Molecule-sized: ≤60 min per direction constraint

### ✅ Step 6: Completion Protocol
- No PR creation by agent
- Manager handles PRs
- Template ready: WORK COMPLETE - READY FOR PR

### ✅ Step 7: Build/Dev Mode Safety
- No customer messaging/payments/production mutations
- Fixtures-only for dev/test mode
- HITL required for operational changes

### ⚠️ Step 8: Escalation (blocked >10 min)

**3 Blockers Require Manager Action**:

1. **CRITICAL - Supabase MCP Authentication**
   - Command attempted: mcp_supabase_list_tables
   - Error: Unauthorized - missing SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN
   - Impact: Cannot access database, migrations, RLS policies (core inventory work blocked)
   - Required: Configure SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN in MCP server or environment

2. **HIGH - GitHub MCP Authentication**
   - Command attempted: mcp_github-official_get_issue (owner: rydyr, repo: hot-dash, issue: 111)
   - Error: 401 Bad credentials
   - Impact: Cannot access Issue #111 full DoD and acceptance criteria
   - Required: Configure valid GitHub token/credentials for MCP server

3. **MEDIUM - Contract Test Path Mismatch**
   - Direction specifies: tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts
   - Actual location: tests/unit/services/inventory/calculations.spec.ts
   - Impact: Contract test command will fail
   - Proposed: Update direction to reference calculations.spec.ts OR create separate payout.spec.ts

**Proposed Next Steps (post-unblock)**:
1. Supabase MCP: List tables → review inventory schema → check migrations status → verify RLS
2. GitHub MCP: Fetch Issue #111 → extract full DoD → validate allowed paths match
3. Manager clarification: Contract test filename
4. Execute DoD: migrations apply → tests → lint → scan → docs → feedback evidence

## MANAGER ATTENTION REQUIRED

**Critical Issues Discovered via CLI**:

1. **Issue #111 Does Not Exist**
   - Direction file references Issue #111 as current work
   - CLI verification: `gh issue view 111 --repo Jgorzitza/HotDash` returns "Could not resolve to an issue"
   - Impact: No DoD, no Allowed paths validation, no acceptance criteria
   - **Action Needed**: Provide correct issue number or create Issue #111

2. **Repository Name Mismatch**
   - Direction may reference "rydyr/hot-dash"
   - Actual repo: "Jgorzitza/HotDash"
   - Impact: MCP tools may be configured for wrong repo

3. **Contract Test Filename Mismatch**
   - Direction specifies: `tests/unit/services/inventory/payout.spec.ts`
   - Actual file: `tests/unit/services/inventory/calculations.spec.ts`
   - Test passes (15/15) but command in direction will fail
   - **Action Needed**: Update direction or create separate payout.spec.ts

4. **Pending Migrations (7 local, not remote)**
   - Local migrations: 20251011070600, 20251011091000, 20251011091500, 20251011143933, 20251011144000, 20251011144030, 20251011150400
   - These include agent_metrics, chatwoot_gold_replies, hot_rodan_data_models, RLS policies, approvals, feedback, queries
   - **Action Needed**: Migration apply plan and approval per docs/specs/inventory_pipeline.md

**Work Completed Without Blockers**:
- ✅ Agent startup checklist (7/8 steps, MCP bypassed with CLI)
- ✅ Contract test passing (15/15 tests in calculations.spec.ts)
- ✅ Code formatting (npm run fmt - all files clean)
- ✅ Linting (npm run lint - 1 warning unrelated to inventory)
- ✅ CLI tools operational (supabase, gh, node, npm, npx, psql)

**Awaiting Manager Direction**:
- Correct Issue number for inventory work
- Migration apply approval and rollout window
- Contract test filename clarification
- Next priority after DoD blockers resolved
