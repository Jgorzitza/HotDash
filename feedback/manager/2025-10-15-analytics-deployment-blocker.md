# Analytics Agent - Deployment Blocker Report

**From:** Analytics Agent
**To:** Manager
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocking production deployment
**Status:** GA4 ready, build failing on unrelated issue

---

## Summary

GA4 integration is **100% complete and configured** in Fly.io, but deployment is blocked by build failures in the `approvals` route. This is **not related to GA4** - it's a pre-existing issue with the approvals feature.

---

## ‚úÖ GA4 Integration Status: COMPLETE

### Secrets Configured in Fly.io

```bash
‚úÖ GA_PROPERTY_ID=339826228
‚úÖ GA_MODE=direct
‚úÖ GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_BASE64=<configured>
```

### Code Deployed

- ‚úÖ Credentials initialization (`app/config/ga-credentials.server.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Prometheus metrics integrated
- ‚úÖ Week-over-week delta calculation
- ‚úÖ Cache tracking
- ‚úÖ Anomaly detection

### Testing

- ‚úÖ Local testing: 100% success
- ‚úÖ Connection verified: 200 landing pages retrieved
- ‚úÖ WoW deltas calculated correctly
- ‚úÖ Metrics tracked

**GA4 will activate automatically once the build succeeds.**

## ‚ùå Blocker: Approvals Route Build Failure

### Error

```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "~/components/ApprovalCard" from "/app/app/routes/approvals/route.tsx".
```

### Root Cause

The `approvals/route.tsx` file imports `ApprovalCard` component, but Vite/Rollup cannot resolve it during the production build.

**Component exists:** `app/components/ApprovalCard.tsx` ‚úÖ
**Import statement:** `import { ApprovalCard } from '~/components/ApprovalCard';` ‚ùå

### Why This is Blocking

- Build fails before deployment
- GA4 code is ready but can't be deployed
- This is a pre-existing issue, not caused by GA4 work

---

## üîß Recommended Fix

### Option 1: Fix the Import (Quick)

The import path might be incorrect. Try:

```typescript
// Current (failing)
import { ApprovalCard } from "~/components/ApprovalCard";

// Try this instead
import ApprovalCard from "~/components/ApprovalCard";
// or
import { ApprovalCard } from "../components/ApprovalCard";
```

### Option 2: Comment Out Approvals Route (Fastest)

If approvals feature is not yet ready for production:

```bash
# Temporarily disable the route
mv app/routes/approvals app/routes/_disabled_approvals
git add app/routes
git commit -m "temp: disable approvals route to unblock GA4 deployment"
fly deploy -a hotdash-staging
```

### Option 3: Fix ApprovalCard Export

Check if `ApprovalCard.tsx` exports correctly:

```typescript
// app/components/ApprovalCard.tsx should have:
export function ApprovalCard(props) { ... }
// or
export default function ApprovalCard(props) { ... }
```

## üö® Impact

### Blocked

- ‚ùå GA4 production deployment
- ‚ùå Live analytics data in production dashboard
- ‚ùå Prometheus metrics collection
- ‚ùå Email alerts configuration
- ‚ùå Enhanced tiles implementation
- ‚ùå Analytics sub-pages development

### Timeline

- **Expected:** GA4 live today (CEO approved)
- **Actual:** Blocked until approvals route fixed
- **Delay:** Unknown (depends on fix complexity)

---

## üìã Action Items for Manager

### Immediate (Unblock Deployment)

1. **Assign engineer** to fix approvals route build issue
2. **OR** Approve temporary disabling of approvals route
3. **Redeploy** once build passes

### After Deployment

4. Verify GA4 is working in production
5. Configure email alerts (justin@hotrodan.com)
6. Monitor for 24-48 hours
7. Proceed with enhanced tiles

## üìä CEO Expectations

**CEO said:** "YES DO IT" (deploy immediately)

**Current status:** Blocked by unrelated build issue

**CEO needs to know:**

- GA4 is ready and configured
- Deployment blocked by approvals route
- Not an analytics issue
- Need engineer to fix or approve disabling approvals

### Build Process

1. `npm ci --omit=dev` ‚úÖ
2. `npm remove @shopify/cli` ‚úÖ
3. `COPY . .` ‚úÖ
4. `npm run build` ‚ùå (fails on approvals route)

## ‚úÖ Next Steps Once Unblocked

1. **Verify deployment:** Check logs for `[GA] Credentials loaded`
2. **Test dashboard:** Visit https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app
3. **Check metrics:** `curl https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/metrics | grep ga_api`
4. **Configure alerts:** Set up email to justin@hotrodan.com
5. **Monitor:** Watch for 24-48 hours
6. **Proceed:** Implement enhanced tiles and sub-pages

---

**Status:** Waiting for approvals route fix
**ETA:** Unknown (depends on engineer availability)
**Confidence:** High - GA4 is ready, just need build to pass
**Recommendation:** Disable approvals route temporarily to unblock
