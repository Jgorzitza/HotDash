### Shutdown — 22:00 (local time)

**Today’s Outcomes (Expanded)**
- Governance (enforced):
  - Added MCP evidence hard gate (guard-mcp), idle heartbeat gate (idle-guard), Danger Foreground Proof, RR7 ban.
  - PR template now requires “## MCP Evidence:” and Foreground Proof paths.
  - Pre-commit MCP hint added.
- Continuous execution:
  - Heartbeat wrapper writes log + ndjson; Codex continuous runner executes policy:contracts → fmt → lint → test:ci → scan without stopping.
  - Launch-all script started 17 lanes in parallel; PIDs recorded.
- Staging readiness:
  - Health endpoint added at /health; production build verified locally.
- Planning + dispatch:
  - Compiled unified feedback report created; deep per-lane molecules plan committed; kickoff + tasks.todo created for every lane.

**Shipped/Committed (selected paths)**
- CI/PR Gates:
  - .github/workflows/guard-mcp.yml
  - .github/workflows/idle-guard.yml
  - Dangerfile.js (Foreground Proof enforcement)
  - .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md (MCP Evidence + Foreground Proof)
  - scripts/policy/ban-remix.mjs (RR7 contract)
  - .husky/pre-commit (MCP hint)
- Continuous Runner + Orchestrator:
  - scripts/policy/with-heartbeat.sh
  - scripts/policy/codex-run.mjs
  - scripts/policy/launch-all-lanes.sh
  - artifacts/ops/2025-10-18/all-lanes-pids.jsonl
- App Health:
  - app/routes/health.ts
- Manager Planning:
  - reports/manager/feedback/compiled_2025-10-19.md
  - reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json
  - reports/manager/status.md
- Per-lane kickoff + task trackers:
  - artifacts/<lane>/2025-10-19/kickoff.md
  - artifacts/<lane>/2025-10-19/tasks.todo.{md,json}
- Runbooks updated:
  - docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md (Codex Quick Start, MCP-before-code, heartbeat, tasks.todo, no-chat)
  - docs/runbooks/agent_shutdown_checklist.md (MCP Evidence + Foreground Proof in PR body, heartbeat evidence)
- Directions (all lanes) updated to require Foreground Proof + DoD heartbeat checkbox; Designer allowed paths expanded for Action Dock harness + tests.

**In Progress**
- Runners active for all lanes (see PIDs): artifacts/ops/2025-10-18/all-lanes-pids.jsonl
- Per-lane heartbeats/telemetry located under: artifacts/<lane>/2025-10-18/logs/

**Incidents**
- Secrets scan (local) — N
- Repo-wide lint debt present; mitigated by continuous runner but scheduled for cleanup in manager plan.

**Per-Lane Summary (Today)**
- Engineer: Build green locally; support QA smoke/a11y; prep Guided Selling rules graph (docs only).
- QA (Claude owner): Smoke 200/200 after provider wrapper; re-run in CI post-merge; a11y subset next.
- Designer: Docs complete; unblocked to implement Action Dock harness + unit tests behind feature.actionDock (OFF).
- Analytics: Telemetry proof stub and CSV header doc added; parametric SQL sketch committed; parity next.
- SEO: PSF spec extended (validations + variables); telemetry spec extended; MCP Admin introspection next.
- Ads: Backfill/tests done; staging apply window needed for metrics; tile wiring after Product confirms.
- Data: Staging apply rehearsal + RLS + seeds next; IPv4 pooler verified.
- Integrations: Chatwoot health probes good; storefront MCP transport mismatch documented; fallback curl JSON used.
- Support: Webhook retry hardened with tests; DB health captured; lint/test blockers noted (global).
- AI‑Customer: Authed probes 200; /rails/health 404 — runbook to emphasize /api + authed probes.
- AI‑Knowledge: Index/eval runs; drift/logs next.
- DevOps: Deploy-to-Staging workflow ready; health checks include /health and root.
- Product: A/B registry example + endpoints doc next.
- Inventory: Seeds + RLS next; telemetry hooks to add.
- Content: Launch notes Tier‑0; fixtures/evidence ongoing.
- Manager: Compiled feedback, molecules file, kickoff, enforcement in CI; staging deploy ready.

**Blockers Cleared**
- Contract path churn (policy:contracts + shims): ✅
- Provider wrapper for /approvals missing error: verified in local smoke; merge order slotted for CI.
- Designer scope: allowed paths expanded with guardrails; no longer blocked.

**Next Goal (tomorrow)**
- Merge SSR provider + policy gates; trigger staging deploy; run QA smoke+a11y; apply ads metrics in staging.

**Agent Performance (quick grading)**
- QA (Claude) — 5; others executing under continuous runner with Foreground Proof.
Status → next intent: Resume molecules per reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json (M-001 first).
