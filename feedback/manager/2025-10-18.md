# Manager ‚Äî Feedback ‚Äî 2025-10-18

Plan Today: Programmatic SEO ‚Üí Guided Selling/Kit Composer ‚Üí CWV‚Üí$$ ‚Üí A/B harness; verify tiles stay green; approvals HITL ON; no autopublish.

## Status Summary
- AI-Knowledge lane: `npm run ai:build-index` + `npm run ai:eval` both succeeded; new artifacts in `packages/memory/indexes/operator_knowledge/` and `packages/memory/logs/build/eval/`.
- Eval metrics remain low (avg_bleu 0.072, avg_rouge_l 0.107, avg_citation_score 0) because responses are mock placeholders pending real content sources.
- Index build still warns about absent sources (`docs/enablement/job_aids`, `docs/marketing/launch_faq.md`, `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`).
- SEO lane P0 complete: vitals adapter + contract tests restored (`app/lib/seo/vitals.ts`, `tests/unit/seo.web-vitals.spec.ts`); lint + vitest logs saved.

## Actions
1. Re-ran `npm run ai:build-index` and `npm run ai:eval`; captured outputs, metrics, and logs in feedback trail.
2. Updated `feedback/ai-knowledge/2025-10-18.md` with command outputs, eval report snapshot, and outstanding drift notes.
3. Flagged missing content source directories for Content Ops follow-up.
4. Pulled Supabase OAuth + service-role credentials via CLI, verified staging access (empty `dashboard.analytics` facts), and updated `docs/runbooks/data_staging_apply.md` with the browser-less credential export workflow for MCP parity checks.

## Risks / Blockers
- **üö® QA P0: Build Failure (NEW)** ‚Äî Build fails during SSR bundle compilation: missing `app/lib/analytics/schemas` module. Three analytics API routes import from non-existent module, blocking ALL testing (smoke, a11y, E2E) and staging deployment. Owner: **Engineer (IMMEDIATE)**. See: `artifacts/qa/2025-10-18/app_usability/ESCALATION_ENGINEER.md` for remediation steps. **Impact: Cannot proceed with launch-day QA smoke tests until fixed.**
- **Eval metrics running on mock data** ‚Äî Without real content sources, BLEU/ROUGE/citation scores remain near zero. Owner: Knowledge Eng + Content Ops; requires real docs before launch.
- **Source library gaps** ‚Äî configured knowledge sources absent; content coverage incomplete until Content Ops provides approved docs or defaults updated.
- **Analytics Supabase ingestion empty** ‚Äî parity check shows Prisma sessions present but Supabase `dashboard.analytics` topic empty; ingestion/backfill coordination required (owner: Analytics Ops + DevOps, ETA 2025-10-19 EOD).
- **SEO P1 items awaiting direction** ‚Äî anomaly triage doc refresh + extended vitals helper tests ready to resume once manager prioritizes.

## Next Steps
1. **üö® URGENT: Assign Engineer to fix QA P0 blocker** ‚Äî Create `app/lib/analytics/schemas` module with 6 required exports (ConversionResponseSchema, RevenueResponseSchema, TrafficResponseSchema + types). Remediation steps in `artifacts/qa/2025-10-18/app_usability/ESCALATION_ENGINEER.md`. **Blocks launch-day QA testing.**
2. **QA: Awaiting direction** ‚Äî QA session paused, ready to resume smoke + a11y tests after Engineer fixes build. See `feedback/qa/2025-10-18.md` for full session details.
3. Partner with Content Ops to supply missing source directories or adjust `DEFAULT_SOURCES` (target: EOD 2025-10-19); once real content lands, rerun eval and track metric movement.
4. Coordinate with Knowledge Eng on replacing mock inference responses with production pipeline once credentials approved; prep regression tracking for CEO review.
5. Await manager guidance on sequencing SEO P1 work (triage doc updates vs. expanded vitals tests); ready to start as soon as allowed paths confirmed.
