# Manager — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary
- Directions reset for every agent; production alignment complete.
- Sub-agent sandbox still read-only; escalation logged.
- CI billing remains unresolved; guardrail workflows blocked.

## Actions
- Updated plan.json/kickoff/merge snapshots; recorded escalations.
- Coordinated direction + feedback resets and status report refresh.
- Staged new plan items for each agent.

## Next Steps
1. Close sandbox + billing escalations with DevOps.
2. Relaunch headless lanes once workspace write access restored.
3. Monitor CI guardrails and update plan accordingly.

## CEO Summary

### Today’s Outcomes
- Shipped/merged: docs refresh commit `d962d1b` (directions/feedback/status alignment).
- In progress: PRs #33 (Integrations dashboard APIs), #32 (Inventory schema), #35/#31 (AI-Knowledge KB design), #28 (Support Chatwoot integration) – tracking DoD completion and pending checks.
- Incidents: secrets (No), CI failures (sandbox prevents automation lanes; CI billing resolved, but outstanding PRs still have failing checks), rogue docs (0).

### Next Goal (tomorrow)
- Primary objective: reopen automation lanes and clear remaining CI failures so feature slices can resume shipping.
- Success criteria: sandbox write escalation closed, edge logger stub merged (AI-Customer), analytics/data migration windows scheduled.
