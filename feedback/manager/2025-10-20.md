**Start**: 2025-10-20T01:45:00Z

## FEEDBACK INGEST — Delta Since Last Pass

### Critical Discovery: Design Files Archived (Oct 15)

**Issue**: CEO reported dashboard doesn't match agreed design  
**Root Cause**: Manager archived 57 design files on Oct 15 as "design drafts"  
**Impact**: Agents built to minimal spec (30% of designed features)  
**Recovery**: All 57 files restored to `/docs/design/` (2025-10-20T00:45:00Z)

**CEO Decision**: Option A - Build full vision (38 tasks, 30 hours, 3-4 days)

### QA Feedback (2025-10-19T20:55:00Z)

**Recommendation**: CONDITIONAL GO (B+ grade, 97.24% test coverage)

**P0 Blockers Identified**:
1. ❌ Missing `/health` route → Engineer
2. ⚠️ RLS unverified → Data

**Status**: ACCEPTED - Assigned P0 tasks to Engineer + Data

**Chrome DevTools MCP**: QA reported "not available" but Manager verified it IS working (used successfully 2025-10-19T22:00:00Z)

**P2 Non-Blocking**:
- 8 test failures in ads/metrics.spec.ts (cosmetic formatting)
