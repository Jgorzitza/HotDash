## 2025-10-20T19:15:00Z — Manager: CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION

**Working On**: Verify CURRENT production state (not old terminal logs)
**Progress**: STEP 1 feedback consolidation complete, verifying current deployment

### CURRENT PRODUCTION STATE (Verified 2025-10-20T19:15Z)

**Fly Status**:
- ✅ App: hotdash-staging.fly.dev
- ✅ Version: 70 (deployed)
- ✅ Machine: d8dd9eea046d08 (state: started, host_status: ok)
- ✅ Latest image: deployment-01K81CGG8VT6ZEEVVT25SAH4V9

**Live Logs** (last 5 minutes):
- ✅ GA API calls: SUCCESS ("ga.api_calls[operation:getTrafficMetrics,success:true]")
- ✅ Metrics logging: Every minute (app healthy and operational)
- ✅ No errors in logs
- ✅ Cache working (analytics:traffic:30d)

**P0 Fixes CONFIRMED LIVE**:
1. ✅ **i18n Fix**: Engineer completed, deployed (AppProvider has i18n prop)
2. ✅ **Chatwoot Restoration**: Support completed (service 503 → 200, health checks passing)
3. ✅ **GA API Integration**: Working (SEO & Content Watch tile green)
4. ✅ **Database Connection**: Supabase connected (port 5432 direct)
5. ✅ **Prisma Schema**: Fixed (@@schema attributes added, deployed successfully)

**Test Status**:
- ✅ 241/273 passing (88.3%)
- ✅ Contract tests: Multiple agents passing (Ads 60/60, Analytics 6/6, Integrations 13/13, SEO 43/43)
- ⏸️ 32 failing tests (pre-existing, not blocking deployment)

**Build Status**:
- ✅ Build time: 516ms (optimized)
- ✅ Server bundle: 216.48 kB
- ✅ Client assets: Proper code-splitting (multiple chunks)
- ✅ Vite: v6.4.1 production build

### CORRECTED STATUS vs OLD CONSOLIDATION

**OLD (From terminal logs)**: Listed i18n, Chatwoot, GA as "pending" or "blocked"  
**CURRENT**: All P0 fixes DEPLOYED and WORKING

**Updated Reality**:
- ❌ Remove "AppProvider error" from blockers (FIXED by Engineer)
- ❌ Remove "Chatwoot down" from blockers (FIXED by Support)
- ❌ Remove "GA API broken" from blockers (FIXED earlier today)
- ✅ Add "33 Engineer tasks remain" (accurate)
- ✅ Add "8 Data migrations pending apply" (accurate)

**Blockers**: NONE for current production app (P0s all resolved)

**Next**: Update PROJECT_PLAN.md consolidation to reflect current state, proceed with direction updates

## 2025-10-20T19:20:00Z — Manager: Direction Update Strategy

**Working On**: STEP 4 - Produce deep executable direction for all 17 agents
**Progress**: Strategy defined based on agent feedback consolidation

### Agent Classification (By Urgency)

**CRITICAL PATH (Update First - 5 agents)**:
1. **Engineer** (#109): 33 tasks remaining (ENG-005 to ENG-038), needs detailed Phase 2-11 breakdown
2. **Designer** (#118): 10 validation tasks, needs retest instructions after i18n fix
3. **Data** (#106): Migration apply coordination, post-apply verification
4. **DevOps** (#108): Migration apply execution, monitoring
5. **Pilot** (#119): Retest after i18n fix, continue validation

**ACTIVE SUPPORT (Update Next - 6 agents)**:
6. **AI-Customer** (#120): Awaiting Engineer ENG-005 (grading UI)
7. **Content** (#105): Microcopy review coordination with Engineer
8. **QA**: Continue PR reviews, prepare for Designer/Pilot retests
9. **Product** (#117): Monitor Option A progress, update launch docs
10. **Support** (#74): Monitor Chatwoot, seed test conversations
11. **Integrations** (#113): Ready for Option A integration requests

**STANDBY (Simple Updates - 6 agents)**:
12. **Ads** (#101): Standby for dashboard integration
13. **Analytics** (#104): Standby for analytics API requests
14. **SEO** (#115): Standby for SEO support
15. **AI-Knowledge** (#71): Standby for KB expansion
16. **Inventory** (#111): Post-git-sync verification, then standby
17. **Manager** (self): Update to v3.0 with reopen process documentation

### Update Approach

**Critical Path** (8-subsection format):
- Objective (1-2 sentences)
- Scope / Out-of-Scope
- Constraints (security, tools, timeline)
- Inputs & Dependencies  
- Detailed Task List (15-20 molecules with acceptance criteria)
- Interfaces & Handoffs
- QA/Telemetry Hooks
- Merge Gates

**Active Support** (6-subsection format):
- Objective
- Current Status
- Support Tasks (3-5 molecules)
- Coordination Points
- Constraints
- Merge Gates

**Standby** (3-subsection format):
- Objective
- Status (work complete, standby mode)
- Ready to Support (what agent can help with)

### Time Estimate

- Critical Path: 5 agents × 15 min = 75 min
- Active Support: 6 agents × 8 min = 48 min
- Standby: 6 agents × 3 min = 18 min
- **Total**: ~140 minutes (2.3 hours)

**Decision**: Proceed with phased approach - Critical Path first, then pause for CEO review before continuing.

**Next**: Update Engineer direction first (most complex, most tasks)
