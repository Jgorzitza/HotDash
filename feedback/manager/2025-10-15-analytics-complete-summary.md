## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blocker

**Issue:** Approvals route build failure
**Impact:** Blocking GA4 deployment
**Cause:** Unconfigured `~` path alias (1-line fix)
**Owner:** Needs manager assignment
**Priority:** HIGH - CEO approved immediate deployment

**Options:**
1. Fix import path (2 minutes)
2. Temporarily disable route (1 minute)
3. Configure path alias (15 minutes)

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (fix import path)

---

### Dependencies for Future Work

**Analytics Sub-pages:**
- Designer agent: UI/UX design
- Engineer agent: Integration and routing
- Analytics agent: Data services and APIs

**Enhanced Tiles:**
- None - Analytics agent can implement independently

**Additional Features:**
- None - Analytics agent can implement independently

## Questions for Manager

### Immediate (Blocking Deployment)

1. **Approvals route fix:** Should Analytics agent make the 1-line fix, or assign to engineer?
2. **Deployment approval:** Once fixed, proceed with deployment immediately?

### Short-term (This Week)

3. **Sub-pages assignment:** Which agents should work on analytics sub-pages?
4. **Enhanced tiles priority:** Implement immediately after deployment, or wait?

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)

5. **Feature prioritization:** Which additional features should be implemented first?
6. **Resource allocation:** Does Analytics agent have capacity for all approved features?
