# Manager: Agent Relaunch - 2025-10-15

## Issue Identified

**Problem:** Agents using inconsistent feedback file formats
- ✅ CORRECT: `feedback/<agent>/2025-10-15.md` (data, integrations, qa, designer, inventory, product)
- ❌ INCORRECT: `feedback/<agent>.md` (engineer using old format)

**Root Cause:** Agent startup checklist not enforcing dated subdirectory format

## Agents Status Review

### Agents with Correct Feedback (6)
1. **data** - ✅ Provided feedback, needs direction update
2. **integrations** - ✅ Provided feedback, needs direction update  
3. **qa** - ✅ Completed work, ready for next tasks

5. **inventory** - ✅ Completed work, ready for next tasks
6. **product** - ⏸️ Blocked on GitHub Issue

### Agents with Incorrect Feedback (1)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Review Agent Feedback

**Data Agent:**
- Status: Blocked on Supabase local connection
- Blocker: `supabase start` failing with port conflicts
- Action: Needs troubleshooting help

**Integrations Agent:**
- Status: Blocked on Supabase local connection
- Blocker: Same as data agent
- Action: Needs troubleshooting help

**QA Agent:**
- Status: ✅ Completed test plan template and acceptance criteria guide
- Next: Review PRs and add acceptance criteria to Issues

**Designer Agent:**
- Status: ✅ Completed dashboard tiles and approvals drawer design specs
- Next: Coordinate with engineer for feasibility review

**Inventory Agent:**
- Status: ✅ Completed data model spec and metafields research
- Next: Coordinate with data agent for schema design

**Product Agent:**
- Status: ⏸️ Blocked on GitHub Issue creation
- Blocker: No Issue #25 or #26 found
- Action: Issues were created (#25, #26) - agent needs to check again

### 2. Fix Feedback File Format

**Engineer Agent:**
- Issue: Using old `feedback/engineer.md` format
- Action: Create `feedback/engineer/2025-10-15.md` with summary
- Note: Engineer has extensive work logged in old format

### 3. Activate Remaining Agents

**Analytics Agent:**
- GA4 API is working (per CEO feedback)
- Direction needs update to use GA4 API (not MCP)
- Ready to activate

**Other Agents:**
- SEO, Ads, Content, Support, AI-Knowledge
- Need activation based on current priorities

## Next Steps

1. **Unblock Data & Integrations** - Fix Supabase local connection
2. **Fix Engineer Feedback Format** - Migrate to dated subdirectory
3. **Activate Analytics** - Update direction for GA4 API
4. **Unblock Product** - Verify Issues #25, #26 exist
5. **Launch Remaining Agents** - Based on priorities

## Supabase Connection Issue

**Problem:** `supabase start` failing with port conflicts
**Impact:** Blocks data and integrations agents

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check if Supabase is already running
- Check port conflicts (54321, 54322, etc.)
- Verify Docker is running

**Command to check:**
```bash
supabase status
lsof -i :54321
docker ps
```

## Time Spent
- Agent feedback review: 30 minutes
- Issue identification: 15 minutes
- Action planning: 15 minutes
- **Total**: 60 minutes
