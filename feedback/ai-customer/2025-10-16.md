# AI-Customer Daily Feedback â€” 2025-10-16

## WORK COMPLETE
- A1: SDK run timeout + error boundary + tests
- A2: HITL approvals wiring (create, poll, enforce in Chatwoot send) + tests
- A3: CEO HITL enforcement (PO tool) + tests
- A4: agents.json reviewers verified; ai-ceo added
- A5: Telemetry added to multiple tools (ongoing)
- B1/B2: LlamaIndex MCP client + fallback; wired into answer_from_docs + tests
- B3: Triage integration (sentiment/priority logging) in handleCustomerConversation
- B4: Supabase logging for grades + edit diffs (storeGrading + captureEditDiff)
- B5: Policy warnings (pre-draft) logging
- D1: PII redaction in structured logs + test
- D4: Incident runbook drafted
- E1/E2: Unit tests added for new behaviors

## EVIDENCE
- Unit tests: 5+ new test files; all passing in targeted runs
- SDK and tool diffs: see structured logs and guards

## BLOCKERS / RISKS
- Full integration test (Chatwoot webhook  approval UI  agent-service) not executed; requires environment + secrets
- Cost/token telemetry not implemented (needs model usage accounting)

## NEXT STEPS
- Extend telemetry to remaining tools; consider token/cost hooks
- Add dashboards (latency, error rates, approval times)
- Expand policy enforcement with explicit rules + validation
- Add integration tests for end-to-end approvals in staging
