# AI-Customer — Feedback — 2025-10-18

## Plan
- Run docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md end-to-end and note evidence.
- Reconfirm Issue #102 DoD + Allowed paths; prep artifacts/tasks + MCP logging.
- Execute lane molecules from reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json or document blocker if unavailable.
- Capture tool outputs + health evidence for Chatwoot/tests before any rollout.

## Log
- 2025-10-19T05:17:32Z — Read NORTH_STAR, OPERATING_MODEL, RULES, and ai-customer direction per startup checklist.
- 2025-10-19T05:17:32Z — Created MCP startup log and tasks.todo.{md,json} under artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/; opened daily feedback plan.
- 2025-10-19T05:22:43Z — Ran `scripts/policy/with-heartbeat.sh ai-customer -- resume --force --mode checklist --verify all`; command `resume` missing (exit 127). Heartbeat: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052243Z.ndjson.
- 2025-10-19T05:25:37Z — Re-ran same heartbeat wrapper at manager request; `resume` still missing (exit 127). Heartbeat: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052537Z.ndjson.
- 2025-10-19T05:42:47Z — Third heartbeat run per command; `resume` remains unavailable (exit 127). Heartbeat: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T054247Z.ndjson.
- 2025-10-19T05:45:51Z — Attempted `bash tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh "node scripts/policy/codex-run.mjs --resume reports/manager/run_state.json --mode checklist --noninteractive"` using heartbeat wrapper; `tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh` not found (exit 127). Heartbeat: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T054551Z.ndjson.

## Blockers
- 2025-10-19T05:18:07Z — Unable to locate reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json after repo search (commands: `find reports -name 'lanes'`, `cat reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json`); documenting pending manager guidance.

## DoD & Allowed Paths
- DoD: Chatwoot health logged; drafts include evidence + grading metadata; `npm run fmt`; `npm run lint`; `npm run test:ci`; `npm run scan`; docs/runbooks updated; feedback updated; contract test (`npm run test:e2e -- tests/playwright/modals.spec.ts`).
- Allowed paths: app/agents/customer/**, app/routes/api/chatwoot.*, tests/playwright/**, tests/integration/chatwoot.api.spec.ts, docs/specs/content_pipeline.md, feedback/ai-customer/2025-10-17.md.

## AGENT FEEDBACK PACKET — IDLE MODE

1. CURRENT STATUS
- State: Blocked (awaiting manager-supplied lane file + resume tooling)
- Most recent verified output: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T054551Z.ndjson
- Dependencies remaining: reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json, runnable `resume`/policy harness scripts

2. BLOCKERS / RISKS
- Description: Unable to execute mandated lane molecules without reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json
  - Root cause: File missing from repo
  - Attempted fix / evidence path: commands logged in feedback (2025-10-19T05:18:07Z entry) and artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/BLOCKER_lanes.json
  - Owner: Manager
  - ETA for resolution: Pending manager guidance
- Description: `resume` tooling unavailable (`resume` binary and tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh` missing)
  - Root cause: Required executables not present in repo PATH
  - Attempted fix / evidence path: Heartbeats artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052243Z.ndjson, ...052537Z.ndjson, ...054247Z.ndjson, ...054551Z.ndjson
  - Owner: Manager / DevOps
  - ETA for resolution: Pending provisioning of tooling

3. NEXT INTENT (SELF-PROPOSED PLAN)
1. Once lane file appears, load molecule sequence and mark tasks.todo statuses accordingly.
2. Re-run mandated policy harness (`resume`/codex-run) as soon as tooling exists, capturing new heartbeat evidence.
3. Prepare Chatwoot health check script run and log output to artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/chatwoot_health.log prior to further code work.
4. Queue `npm run test:ci` dry run after tooling unblock to validate Supabase edge logger stub behavior.

4. REQUIRED INPUT FROM MANAGER
- Provide `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json` or updated lane instructions.
- Restore/install `resume` binary and `tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh` wrapper expected by policy commands.

5. PERFORMANCE SNAPSHOT
- Score: 2 — Startup checklist complete and evidence logged, but progress blocked by missing manager assets/tooling.

6. EVIDENCE LINKS
- Heartbeats: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052243Z.ndjson, ...052537Z.ndjson, ...054247Z.ndjson, ...054551Z.ndjson
- Blocker record: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/BLOCKER_lanes.json
- MCP evidence: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/mcp/startup_checklist.jsonl, artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/mcp/feedback_packet.jsonl, artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/mcp/shutdown_checklist.jsonl

### Shutdown — 00:40 MDT

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #102 — PR: n/a — Branch: batch-20251019/analytics-m10403-export (no ai-customer PR open)
- DoD completion: 40% (startup + evidence logged; blocked before core deliverable)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Logged MCP + heartbeat evidence for missing policy tooling.
  - Generated idle feedback packet and documented blockers.
  - Captured shutdown git status snapshot.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/shutdown_git_status.log; artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/shutdown_env_check.log; artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T054551Z.ndjson (policy wrapper); prior heartbeats listed above.
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: docs.runbook (startup, shutdown), governance.feedback.

**Blockers**

- Missing lane file (`reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json`) → **owner**: manager — **ETA**: pending manager drop.
- Policy harness binaries (`resume`, `tools/policy/run_with_gates.sh`) absent → **owner**: manager/devops — **ETA**: pending installation.

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Re-run `resume`/codex policy harness once binaries provided and lane file restored.
2. Execute Chatwoot health + `npm run test:ci` to validate edge logger stub before coding.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 2
- Evidence quality: 4
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 4
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 4

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Captured required MCP and heartbeat artifacts for every directions request.
  2. Documented blockers precisely with paths for manager follow-up.
  3. Maintained feedback discipline with idle + shutdown packets.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Confirm availability of policy binaries earlier in the cycle.
  2. Pre-stage health check scripts to avoid delays once unblocked.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** assuming policy harness binaries are present without verifying via PATH check.

STATUS=READY_FOR_DIRECTION_UPDATE

### Shutdown — 00:59 MDT

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #102 — PR: n/a — Branch: batch-20251019/lanes-ads-queue-v2 (no ai-customer PR)
- DoD completion: 40% (still blocked by missing Supabase edge stub validation)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Re-ran shutdown checklist per request and captured new git/env evidence.
  - Logged additional MCP entry for shutdown runbook rerun.
  - Noted repo now includes `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json` and policy scripts; awaiting go-ahead before resuming work.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/shutdown_git_status_2.log; artifacts/ai-customer/2025-10-18/shutdown_env_check_2.log.
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: docs.runbook (shutdown rerun).

**Blockers**

- Pending manager instruction to restart lane execution after shutdown → **owner**: manager — **ETA**: TBD.
- Need confirmation before invoking newly-added policy tooling to avoid unauthorized execution → **owner**: manager/devops — **ETA**: TBD.

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Request confirmation that new policy tools are ready before attempting `resume`/`codex-run` again.
2. Once cleared, run Chatwoot health + `npm run test:ci` and resume molecules per lane file.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 2
- Evidence quality: 4
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 4
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 4

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Complied with repeated shutdown requests with full evidence each time.
  2. Maintained precise logs of tool availability changes.
  3. Preserved feedback trail for manager direction updates.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Immediately sync with manager when new tooling lands to prevent idle time.
  2. Automate log capture commands into a script for faster shutdown compliance.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** assuming shutdown already satisfied without fresh evidence when asked to rerun.
