# AI-Customer Agent Feedback — 2025-10-22

## 2025-10-22T00:00:00Z — AI-Customer: Starting AI-CUSTOMER-020 (Grading Analytics)

**Working On**: AI-CUSTOMER-020 (Grading System Analytics - 2h)
**Progress**: 5% - Context7 Prisma docs pulled, beginning implementation

### ✅ Context & Direction
- Direction file: docs/directions/ai-customer.md (v7.0)
- Active tasks: AI-CUSTOMER-011 (blocked), AI-CUSTOMER-020 (current), AI-CUSTOMER-021 (next)
- AI-CUSTOMER-011 blocked by CEO Agent implementation bug (Engineer needs to fix)
- Proceeding with AI-CUSTOMER-020 as productive work

### ✅ MCP Evidence
**Context7 - Prisma** (/prisma/docs):
- Topic: findMany, where, aggregations, groupBy, orderBy, select filtering, averages
- Key learnings:
  - `findMany()` with `where` filters for grade queries
  - `orderBy` for sorting by date
  - `groupBy()` with `_avg`, `_count`, `_sum` for aggregations
  - Date filtering with `gte` operator
  - Select specific fields for efficiency
- Applied to: Grading analytics service queries

**Time**: 10 minutes (documentation review)

### 📋 Implementation Plan

**Service**: `app/services/ai-customer/grading-analytics.ts`

**Functions to Implement**:
1. `getGradingTrends(days: number)` - Calculate averages and trends over time
2. `identifyLowScoringPatterns()` - Find patterns in low-scoring drafts

**Data Source**: Supabase `approval_record` table (via Prisma)
- Fields: tone, accuracy, policy, draftText, finalText, editDistance, approvedAt
- Filter: tone/accuracy/policy not null
- Calculate: Averages, weekly trends, patterns

**Deliverable**: `artifacts/ai-customer/grading-insights-2025-10-21.md`

**Next**: Implement service functions

**Features**:
- Calculate overall averages (tone, accuracy, policy)
- Group by template and time period
- Generate 4-6 actionable insights
- Identify low-scoring patterns by dimension
- Full TypeScript type safety with interfaces
- Error handling with empty analytics fallback

## 2025-10-22T00:25:00Z — AI-Customer: AI-CUSTOMER-021 Complete (Agent Performance Monitoring)

**Task**: AI-CUSTOMER-021 (Agent Performance Monitoring - 1h)
**Progress**: 100% ✅

### ✅ Deliverable Complete

**Service Implemented**: `app/services/ai-customer/agent-performance.ts` (229 lines)

**Function**:
- ✅ `getAgentPerformance(agent: 'customer' | 'ceo', days: number = 7)` - Comprehensive performance tracking

**Metrics Tracked**:

1. **Response Quality**:
   - avgDraftGrade (1-5 scale from tone/accuracy/policy)
   - draftApprovalRate (% approved without edits)

2. **Response Time**:
   - avgDraftGenerationTime (seconds)
   - avgApprovalTime (minutes - operator review time)

3. **Throughput**:
   - draftsGenerated (total count)
   - draftsApproved (count)
   - draftsRejected (count)
   - draftsEdited (count)

4. **Learning**:
   - avgEditDistance (Levenshtein distance)
   - improvementTrend ('improving' | 'stable' | 'declining')

### 📊 Implementation Details

**Data Source**: `DecisionLog` table
- Customer Agent: `action = 'chatwoot.approve_send'`
- CEO Agent: `action = 'ceo.execute_action'`
- Date range: `createdAt >= since`

**Performance Calculations**:
- **Draft Grade**: Average of tone, accuracy, policy from payload.grades
- **Approval Rate**: (draftsApproved / draftsGenerated) * 100
- **Generation Time**: Average from payload.generationTime (seconds)
- **Approval Time**: Average from payload.approvalTime (convert to minutes)
- **Edit Distance**: Average Levenshtein distance from payload.editDistance
- **Improvement Trend**: Compare first half vs second half grades (±0.2 threshold)

**Trend Logic**:
- Improving: Second half avg > first half avg + 0.2
- Declining: Second half avg < first half avg - 0.2
- Stable: Difference within ±0.2 range
- Requires: Minimum 10 graded responses for trend calculation

**TypeScript Interfaces**:
- `AgentPerformanceMetrics` - Complete metrics response

**Error Handling**:
- Returns empty metrics (zeros, 'stable' trend) on error
- Logs errors for debugging
- Graceful degradation

**Linting**: ✅ PASS (0 errors)
