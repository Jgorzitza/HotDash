# AI-Customer — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary
- Playwright CX suites passing with mock admin storage + Escape handler.
- Supabase edge logger stub pending to silence dial attempts in `npm run test:ci`.
- AI drafts delivering Private Notes with evidence; grading metrics captured in Supabase.

## Health Evidence
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- tests/playwright/modals.spec.ts
npm run test:ci # watch for Supabase edge logger noise
scripts/ops/check-chatwoot-health.sh
```
- Chatwoot `/rails/health` + authenticated probe logged in `artifacts/ops/chatwoot_health_2025-10-17.json`

## Blockers / Risks
- [ ] Stub Supabase edge logger to keep CI quiet (`AI_CUSTOMER_STUB_EDGE_LOGGER=1`)
- [ ] Coordinate with Support to schedule weekly learning sync

## Next Steps
1. Land edge logger stub PR and rerun `npm run test:ci`.
2. Automate grading exports for Ops dashboard.
3. Review Publer/SEO dependencies before enabling cross-team suggestions.
