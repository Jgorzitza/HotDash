## 2025-10-21T23:00:00Z — Engineer: Session Summary

**Current Status**: 2/5 tasks complete (40%)

**Completed** (2.5h):
- ✅ ENG-029: PII Redaction Utility (1h) - 13/13 tests passing
- ✅ ENG-030: PII Card Component (1.5h) - 22/22 tests passing

**Remaining Tasks** (~3.5h estimate):
- ⏳ ENG-031: CX Escalation Modal Integration (1h) - Complex integration, CXEscalationModal exists but designed for Chatwoot conversations without order data
- ⏳ ENG-032: Action Link Click Handler (1h) - Update ActionQueueCard.tsx
- ⏳ ENG-033: GA4 Event Emission (1h) - Update analytics.ts

**Evidence Summary**:
- Files created: 4 new (2 source, 2 test)
- Total lines: ~1,073 lines
- Tests passing: 35/35 (100% pass rate)
- Build: TypeScript clean, no linter errors
- MCP calls: 2 (Context7 TypeScript, Shopify Dev MCP Polaris)
- MCP Evidence: Logged in artifacts/engineer/2025-10-21/mcp/pii-redaction.jsonl and pii-card.jsonl
- Heartbeat: Logged in artifacts/engineer/2025-10-21/heartbeat.ndjson

**Blockers**: 
- ENG-031 complexity: CXEscalationModal is designed for Chatwoot conversations, not order-based scenarios with shipping/tracking data. Would need to either:
  1. Mock order data for demonstration
  2. Redesign to work with conversation context only
  3. Create separate order-based modal

**Next Actions**:
Given time constraints and remaining work (ENG-032, ENG-033 are P0 CRITICAL for GA4 attribution), recommend:
1. Prioritize ENG-032 and ENG-033 (Phase 11) as they're marked P0 CRITICAL in direction
2. Defer ENG-031 or implement minimal version with mock data
3. Focus on completing action attribution tracking which CEO stated is critical

**Growth Engine Compliance**:
- ✅ MCP Evidence JSONL: Created and populated
- ✅ Heartbeat NDJSON: Created and updated every task
- ✅ No Dev MCP imports in app/ (verified)
- ✅ Evidence logged as summaries (max 10 lines per command)

**Awaiting**: Manager direction on prioritization of ENG-031 vs proceeding directly to P0 Phase 11 tasks
