## üîÑ NEXT WORK IN DIRECTION: Support Tasks (Lines 632-669)

### ENG-034: Designer PII Card Validation Support (1h) ‚Äî P1
**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è **WAITING** - Requires Designer to start DES-017  
**Type**: Support task (answer questions, provide walkthrough, assist with refinements)  
**Dependency**: Designer must begin validation work first

### ENG-035: QA/Pilot Testing Support (1h) ‚Äî P1
**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è **WAITING** - Requires QA to start QA-009 and Pilot to start PILOT-012  
**Type**: Support task (clarify test scenarios, provide examples, debug failures)  
**Dependency**: QA/Pilot must begin testing first

---

## ‚ùì CLARIFICATION NEEDED

**Direction says**: "START NOW" (line 632)  
**But tasks are**: Support/reactive tasks requiring other agents to start first

**Options**:
1. **Wait for Designer/QA/Pilot** - Support tasks are reactive (answer questions when they arise)
2. **Proactive prep** - Create support documentation ahead of time (test scenarios, component walkthrough)
3. **New assignment** - Manager provides different ACTIVE tasks

**Current Understanding**: 
- Support tasks can't be "started" until Designer/QA/Pilot begin their work
- I'm in standby mode waiting for questions/issues to arise
- OR I should create support documentation proactively

**Question for Manager**: 
Should I:
- A) Wait in standby for Designer/QA/Pilot to start and react to questions?
- B) Proactively create support documentation (walkthrough docs, test scenarios)?
- C) Work on different tasks (not listed in direction)?
