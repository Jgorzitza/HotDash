# Engineer Feedback — 2025-10-21

## 2025-10-21T22:48:42Z — Engineer: Session Started

**Direction**: engineer.md v7.0 (ACTIVE: Phase 9 + Phase 11 + BLOCKER-003)
**Branch**: `manager-reopen-20251021`

---

## ✅ ALL EXECUTABLE TASKS COMPLETED

### Phase 9: PII Card Component (2/3 tasks, 2.5h) ✅

**ENG-029: PII Redaction Utility** (1h) - COMPLETE
**ENG-030: PII Card Component** (1.5h) - COMPLETE
**ENG-031: CX Escalation Modal Integration** - DEFERRED (architecture mismatch)

### BLOCKER-003: Test Auth Setup (30min) ✅ RESOLVED

**File Created**: `docs/runbooks/test-auth-setup.md`
**Unblocks**: PILOT-006 (Settings Page smoke test)

### Phase 11: Action Attribution (1/2 tasks, 1h) ✅

**ENG-033: GA4 Event Emission** (1h) - COMPLETE
- Files: `app/utils/analytics.ts` (286 lines) + tests (123 lines)
- Tests: ✅ 10/10 passing
- Features: trackEvent, trackPageView, trackAddToCart, trackBeginCheckout, trackPurchase
- Action attribution: Automatic `hd_action_key` custom dimension inclusion
- Session management: 24h TTL, auto-clear after purchase

**ENG-032: Action Link Click Handler** - ⚠️ BLOCKED

**Issue**: Direction file states `app/components/ActionQueueCard.tsx (existing file - UPDATE)` but component **DOES NOT EXIST** in codebase.

**Investigation**:
- Searched entire codebase: No ActionQueueCard.tsx found
- Found ApprovalCard.tsx (different purpose - Approvals Drawer, not Action Queue)
- Action attribution backend exists: `app/services/analytics/action-attribution.ts`
- Action Queue database schema referenced but no frontend UI component

**Question for Manager**: 
**Who is responsible for creating ActionQueueCard.tsx?**

**Possible Scenarios**:
1. **Earlier Engineer phase missed**: Should have been created in Phase 1-8?
2. **Designer task**: UI component creation before Engineer integration?
3. **Future phase**: Component will be created in a later phase?
4. **Direction error**: Component name incorrect (should be ApprovalCard or different component)?

**Impact**:
- Cannot complete ENG-032 without component to update
- GA4 tracking (ENG-033) is complete and ready to use
- Backend attribution service exists and functional
- Just missing frontend component to add click handlers

**Recommendation**:
- Clarify component ownership
- If Engineer should create: Estimate +2h for new component
- If Designer should create: Hand off to Designer agent first
- Alternative: Create minimal ActionQueueCard stub for ENG-032 completion

## 🚨 ESCALATION: ENG-032 Component Ownership

**Question for Manager**: Direction file engineer.md v7.0 line 321 states:

> **File**: `app/components/ActionQueueCard.tsx` **(existing file - UPDATE)**

But this component **does not exist** in the codebase.

**Request**:
1. Clarify which agent should create ActionQueueCard.tsx
2. Provide component spec/requirements if Engineer should create it
3. Update direction file if component name is incorrect

**Impact**: Cannot complete ENG-032 until component exists or alternative identified
