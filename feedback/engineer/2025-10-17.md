# Engineer — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary
- Idea pool drawer harness implemented with unit tests (`tests/unit/routes/ideas.drawer.spec.ts`).
- Accessibility fixes applied (Escape handling) across modals.
- Pending QA sign-off for Playwright tags.

## Evidence
```bash
npx vitest run tests/unit/routes/ideas.drawer.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e
```

## Blockers / Risks
- Need QA to confirm visual regression coverage.
- Ads tile updates depend on Analytics credential rollout.

## Next Steps
1. Pair with QA to finalize Playwright tagging.
2. Document engineer notes for idea pool harness.
3. Support Ads/Analytics integration after credential mock plan ready.
