# Engineer — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary
- Idea pool drawer harness implemented with unit tests (`tests/unit/routes/ideas.drawer.spec.ts`).
- Accessibility fixes applied (Escape handling) across modals.
- Pending QA sign-off for Playwright tags.
- Added minimal /ideas route with integrated drawer harness (`app/routes/ideas/route.tsx`).
- Fixed test helper to wrap Polaris components; dashboard tiles unit tests passing.
- Resolved redundant role a11y lint warnings in modal components.



## Evidence
```bash
npx vitest run tests/unit/components/dashboard/tiles.spec.tsx
npx vitest run tests/unit/routes/ideas.drawer.spec.tsx
npx vitest run tests/unit/routes/ideas.route.spec.tsx
# optional: playwright (may require env)
# npm run test:e2e
```

## Blockers / Risks

### Shutdown — 14:19 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #109 — PR: (none yet) — Branch: main
- DoD completion: Partial for today (unit tests added/passing; targeted a11y lint fixed; secret scan clean)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Added minimal /ideas route and integrated Idea Drawer harness
  - Implemented contract test for drawer open/close + Escape
  - Resolved redundant role a11y warning in modals; targeted lint OK

**Evidence**

- Tests:
  - `npx vitest run tests/unit/components/dashboard/tiles.spec.tsx` — PASS
  - `npx vitest run tests/unit/routes/ideas.drawer.spec.tsx` — PASS
  - `npx vitest run tests/unit/routes/ideas.route.spec.tsx` — PASS
- Policy & Security:
  - `node scripts/policy/check-docs.mjs` — PASS
  - `npm run scan` (gitleaks) — no leaks found
- Tool calls used: MCP quick test (`mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh`), Vitest, ESLint (targeted files)

**Blockers**

- Global ESLint errors across many files (outside touched paths) → owner: engineer/manager — ETA: next session scoped cleanup
- E2E/Playwright may require environment credentials; kept scope to unit tests today → owner: manager to confirm env guidance

**Next‑start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Add Playwright selectors/tags and a minimal drawer/modal E2E test (skip heavy env deps)
2. Scoped lint triage for approvals route and related imports

**Self‑grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 4
- Evidence quality: 5
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5
- Tool discipline (MCP‑first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 5

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Established passing contract/unit tests for the idea drawer quickly
  2. Resolved targeted a11y issues without broad changes
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Expand tests to cover route URL-triggered drawer open and focus management
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Running broad lint fixes without a scoped plan

- Need QA to confirm visual regression coverage.
- Ads tile updates depend on Analytics credential rollout.

## Next Steps
1. Pair with QA to finalize Playwright tagging.
2. Document engineer notes for idea pool harness.
3. Support Ads/Analytics integration after credential mock plan ready.

```markdown
Shutdown complete — see latest feedback entry (2025-10-17).
- Status: Unit/contract tests for Idea Drawer passing; targeted a11y fix applied
- Evidence: `npx vitest run tests/unit/routes/ideas.drawer.spec.tsx` PASS; `npx vitest run tests/unit/routes/ideas.route.spec.tsx` PASS
- Blockers: E2E depends on missing Approvals subcomponents and environment; global lint debt outside touched paths
- Next start: Add Playwright selectors and minimal E2E; scoped lint triage for approvals imports
- Allowed paths: app/routes/ideas/**, app/components/ideas/**, tests/unit/routes/**, tests/unit/components/**, feedback/engineer/2025-10-17.md
