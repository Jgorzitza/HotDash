## Coordination Notes for Engineer

### Implementation Feasibility Questions

1. **Dashboard Tiles**:
   - Current TileCard component is custom CSS - migration to Polaris Card feasible?
   - Loading states: Can we implement skeleton UI with current architecture?
   - Error retry mechanism: Need backend support for retry endpoints?
   - Real-time updates: SSE/WebSocket infrastructure ready?

2. **Approvals Drawer**:
   - Polaris Modal size="large" - does it support our layout needs?
   - Validation endpoint `/validate` - is this implemented?
   - Grading modal: Should this be a separate component or inline?
   - Keyboard shortcuts: Any conflicts with Shopify Admin shortcuts?

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Focus trap library recommendation? (focus-trap-react?)
   - Screen reader testing: Do we have NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver test environment?
   - High contrast mode: Any known Polaris issues?

4. **Performance**:
   - Drawer first paint target: 500ms - achievable with current data fetching?
   - Animation performance: Any concerns with 300ms slide transitions?
   - Large datasets: Pagination or virtualization needed for evidence tabs?

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Engineer Review**: Review both specs for technical feasibility
2. **Prototype**: Build basic drawer prototype with Polaris Modal
3. **Accessibility Audit**: Set up automated testing (axe, Lighthouse)
4. **Design Tokens**: Verify all tokens in `app/styles/tokens.css` are sufficient
5. **Component Library**: Decide on Polaris migration timeline

## Blockers

None currently. Awaiting engineer feedback on feasibility.

## Questions for Manager

1. Should we prioritize Polaris migration or keep custom CSS for now?
2. Timeline for accessibility testing setup (screen readers, high contrast)?
3. Do we need design review from Shopify Polaris team?
4. Should grading interface be MVP or can it be Phase 2?
