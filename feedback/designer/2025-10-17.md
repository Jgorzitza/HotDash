# Designer — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary

- Production microcopy drafted for approvals, idea pool, Publer flows.
- Responsive dashboard tile specs ready for Engineer review.
- Accessibility annotations delivered for Playwright checks.

## Evidence

- `docs/design/approvals_microcopy.md`
- `docs/design/dashboard-tiles.md`

## Blockers / Risks

- Awaiting CEO/mgmt sign-off on final copy.
- Need QA to confirm visual regression coverage per checklist.

## Next Steps

1. Review copy with CEO and update doc accordingly.
2. Pair with Engineer to verify component states.
3. Deliver final checklist to QA before regression run.

## 2025-10-18 — Direction Follow-Up

- Commands: docs-only updates (no build/tests executed).
- Deliverables:
  - Authored `docs/design/approvals_microcopy.md` with production copy for approvals drawer, idea pool, and Publer scheduling flows (includes sign-off table + outstanding dependencies).
  - Added `docs/design/visual_regression_checklist.md` covering approvals, idea pool, Publer queue, and Ads Slice C anomaly captures.
- Evidence:
  - docs/design/approvals_microcopy.md
  - docs/design/visual_regression_checklist.md
- Outstanding:
  - CEO and QA sign-off still pending; follow-ups scheduled for 2025-10-19.
  - Ads/Analytics owe Publer severity thresholds + receipt payload sample for anomaly documentation.
  - Engineering to surface deterministic fixtures so QA can capture new VR baselines (Publer failure + anomaly states).

### Outreach Log — 2025-10-18

- **CEO + QA:** Sent summary of updated microcopy/VR checklist with request for sign-off targets (2025-10-19 15:00Z); logged pending status in doc tables.
- **Ads & Analytics:** Shared Publer severity copy needs + receipt payload request pulled from approvals doc; awaiting payload samples to finalize anomaly section.
- **Engineering:** Asked for deterministic fixtures covering Publer failure + Ads Slice C alerts so QA can capture snapshots; tracking ETA alongside QA follow-up.

### Shutdown — 01:01 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #107 — PR: n/a (docs-only) — Branch: main
- DoD completion: 70% (waiting on CEO/QA sign-off + anomaly fixtures)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Authored consolidated approvals & growth microcopy with stakeholder matrix.
  - Published expanded visual regression checklist covering Publer and idea pool states.
  - Logged outreach to CEO/QA, Ads/Analytics, and Engineering for remaining dependencies.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: not run (docs-only updates)
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: bash shell for file edits

**Blockers**

- CEO + QA sign-off pending on updated copy/checklist → **owner**: CEO / QA — **ETA**: 2025-10-19 15:00Z
- Ads/Analytics to provide Publer severity thresholds & receipt payload sample → **owner**: Ads/Analytics — **ETA**: 2025-10-19 EOD
- Engineering fixtures for Publer failure + Ads Slice C alerts → **owner**: Engineering — **ETA**: awaiting schedule

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Follow up with CEO/QA on sign-off commitments and document responses.
2. Partner with Ads/Analytics and Engineering to integrate severity thresholds and deterministic fixtures into docs.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 4
- Evidence quality: 4
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 4

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Captured comprehensive microcopy and VR coverage with clear ownership.
  2. Documented dependencies and outreach so stakeholders know next actions.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Secure fixture support earlier to unblock QA captures sooner.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Letting sign-off requests go out without concrete follow-up windows.
