# Support — Feedback — 2025-10-19

## 2025-10-19T17:16:38Z — Support: Startup Complete & DoD Status Update

**Working On**: Issue #116 - Chatwoot webhook retry production hardening (per docs/directions/support.md v2.0)

**Progress**: 95% - All core deliverables complete, minor blockers outside lane scope

**Evidence**:
1. ✅ Contract test passing:
   - Command: `npx vitest run tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts`
   - Result: 4/4 tests passed (42ms)
   - Tests: Retry on 502/503, HTTP 429 throttling, client error no-retry, exhaustion after max attempts
   
2. ✅ Core implementation files verified:
   - app/services/support/webhook.server.ts (5210 bytes, retry logic with exponential backoff)
   - tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts (4 test scenarios)
   - docs/runbooks/support_webhooks.md (retry policy, verification steps, monitoring, escalation)

3. ✅ DoD checks completed:
   - `npm run fmt`: PASS (all files unchanged, properly formatted)
   - `npm run lint`: PASS with 1 warning (app/routes/api.analytics.traffic.ts unused 'request' param - outside support scope)
   - `npm run scan`: PASS (gitleaks scanned 561 commits, 0 leaks found)
   - Contract test: PASS (4/4 integration tests)

4. ⚠️ DoD check - test:ci blocked by out-of-scope failures:
   - `npm run test:ci`: COMPLETED - 16 failures, ALL outside support lane scope
   - Support tests: ✅ PASSED (4/4 tests in tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts)
   - Unit test suite: 49 passed, 5 failed (54 files) | 334 tests passed, 16 failed (350 total)
   - Failures in: content/tone-validator (6), ads/campaign-metrics (4), ads/services (4), dashboard/ContentTile (2)
   - All failures are outside allowed paths (content lane, ads lane - NOT support scope)

5. ✅ Startup checklist completed:
   - Read NORTH_STAR.md, OPERATING_MODEL.md, RULES.md
   - Read docs/directions/support.md (v2.0, effective 2025-10-17)
   - Reviewed allowed paths: tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts, docs/runbooks/support_webhooks.md, app/services/support/**, feedback/support/2025-10-17.md
   - Created 2025-10-19.md feedback file

**Blockers**:
1. ⚠️ GitHub MCP authentication (401 Bad credentials)
   - Impact: Cannot fetch Issue #116 details via MCP
   - Workaround: Using direction file which references Issue #116
   - Severity: Low (direction file has all needed context)
   - Owner: Manager/DevOps (GitHub token refresh needed)

2. 🚫 `npm run test:ci` blocked by out-of-scope test failures
   - Impact: CI gate will fail repo-wide
   - Support scope: ✅ ALL PASSING (4/4 integration tests)
   - Failures: 16 tests in content lane (tone-validator 6), ads lane (campaign-metrics 4, services 4, ContentTile 2)
   - Owner: Content lane, Ads lane (NOT support responsibility)
   - Severity: BLOCKING for repo but NOT blocking for support lane completion
   - Evidence: Test output saved to /tmp/support-test-ci-output.log
   
3. ℹ️ Legacy lint warning (outside scope)
   - File: app/routes/api.analytics.traffic.ts:24:32
   - Issue: Unused 'request' parameter (not prefixed with _)
   - Owner: Analytics lane
   - Impact: None on support lane work

**Next**:
1. ✅ Startup checklist: COMPLETE
2. ✅ All DoD items verified (support scope)
3. 📋 Escalate to manager:
   - **Support lane work: 100% COMPLETE** (webhook retry implementation, tests, runbook, DoD checks)
   - **Repo-wide blocker**: test:ci failing due to 16 out-of-scope test failures (content + ads lanes)
   - **Recommendation**: Approve support lane PR despite test:ci failures (all support tests passing)
   - **OR**: Manager assigns content/ads lanes to fix their failing tests before any merges
4. 📋 Await manager direction on:
   - How to proceed with test:ci blocker (approve support work separately vs wait for other lanes?)
   - Task #2: coordinate with AI-Customer/Knowledge for grading signals
   - Task #3: additional runbook updates for outage response
   - Task #4: weekly support health report format

**Status**: SUPPORT_WORK_COMPLETE_AWAITING_CROSS_LANE_RESOLUTION

## Evidence Artifacts

**Test Results**:
- Support tests: 4/4 PASSING (tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts)
- Full test:ci output: `/tmp/support-test-ci-output.log`
- Test failure analysis: `/tmp/support-test-failure-summary.md`

**Implementation Files**:

- Integration tests: `tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts` (120 lines, 4 scenarios)
- Runbook: `docs/runbooks/support_webhooks.md` (39 lines)

**DoD Verification**:

**Cross-Lane Coordination Needed**:
- Content lane: 8 test failures (tone-validator, ContentTile)
- Ads lane: 8 test failures (CampaignMetricsTile, services)
- Manager decision required on merge strategy

---

## Manager Action Items

1. **Review**: Support lane deliverables complete (webhook retry implementation + tests + runbook)
2. **Decide**: Merge strategy given test:ci blocker
   - Option A: Approve support PR (all support tests passing)
   - Option B: Wait for content/ads test fixes
   - Option C: Temporary CI bypass for known failures
3. **Direct**: Next tasks from direction file
   - Task #2: AI-Customer/Knowledge coordination
   - Task #3: Outage response runbook
   - Task #4: Weekly health report format
4. **Unblock**: GitHub MCP authentication (if Issue access needed)
