# Support — Feedback — 2025-10-18

## 1. Current Status
- State: Idle
- Most recent verified output:
  - app/services/support/webhook.server.ts (retry + logging helper)
  - tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts (integration coverage)
  - docs/runbooks/support_webhooks.md (retry policy runbook)
  - Targeted test run: `npx vitest run tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts`
- Dependencies remaining: Repo-wide `npm run lint` and `npm run test:ci` still failing due to legacy issues outside lane scope.

## 2. Blockers / Risks
- Description: `npm run lint` exits with legacy eslint errors (unused Vitest globals, explicit `any` in unit tests).
  - Root cause: Historical debt in shared unit test files untouched by current slice.
  - Attempted fix / evidence path: See heartbeat log `artifacts/support/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052309Z.ndjson`.
  - Owner: Platform/QA maintainers (needs coordinated cleanup).
  - ETA for resolution: Pending manager prioritization.

- Description: `npm run test:ci` blocked by Polaris `AppProvider` absence in dashboard tile tests.
  - Root cause: Existing dashboard tile specs lacking provider scaffold (outside support allowed paths).
  - Attempted fix / evidence path: Heartbeat log `artifacts/support/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052400Z.ndjson`.
  - Owner: Dashboard/UI lane.
  - ETA for resolution: Awaiting cross-lane assignment.

## 3. Next Intent (Self-Proposed Plan)
1. Instrument `app/services/support/webhook.server.ts` to emit retry metrics into support telemetry (facts server) once direction clears.
2. Extend `tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts` with coverage for HTTP 429 throttling behavior.
3. Publish updated weekly health snapshot in `feedback/support/2025-10-17.md` after AI-Customer grading signals land.

## 4. Required Input from Manager
- Confirm which lane will remediate Polaris AppProvider test scaffolding so `npm run test:ci` can gate merges.
- Provide go/no-go on emitting webhook retry metrics into `recordDashboardFact` from support services.

## 5. Performance Snapshot
- Score: 4
- Reasons: Delivered webhook retry implementation/tests/runbook updates within allowed paths; unavoidable failures stem from pre-existing lint/test gaps awaiting broader remediation.
