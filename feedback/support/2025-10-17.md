# Support — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary
- Webhook retry tests drafted; awaiting review.
- Runbook update in progress for retries + outage response.
- Weekly health report template created.

## Evidence
```bash
npx vitest run tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts
```

## Blockers / Risks
- Need QA review of webhook tests.
- Awaiting AI-Customer grading data feed for weekly report.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize webhook tests and merge after QA sign-off.
2. Publish runbook update with retry policy.
3. Generate first weekly health report.

## 2025-10-18 Plan
- [ ] Validate instructions (North Star, Operating Model, Rules) and confirm alignment.
- [ ] Execute support lane molecules from reports/manager plan; capture progress and blockers.
- [ ] Update artifacts (tasks, MCP evidence) and run required checks/tests before marking slice complete.

### 2025-10-18 Work Log
- Implemented Chatwoot webhook forwarder with retry/backoff (`app/services/support/webhook.server.ts`) and added integration coverage (`tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts`).
- Authored `docs/runbooks/support_webhooks.md` detailing retry policy, verification, and escalation steps.
- Commands (heartbeat logs under `artifacts/support/2025-10-19/heartbeat/`):
  - `scripts/policy/with-heartbeat.sh support -- npm run fmt` ✅ `foreground-20251019T052213Z.ndjson`
  - `scripts/policy/with-heartbeat.sh support -- npm run lint` ❌ legacy lint debt (unused Vitest globals, widespread `any` usage) — see `foreground-20251019T052309Z.ndjson`
  - `scripts/policy/with-heartbeat.sh support -- npm run test:ci` ❌ baseline Polaris AppProvider gap in dashboard tile tests — see `foreground-20251019T052400Z.ndjson`
  - `scripts/policy/with-heartbeat.sh support -- npm run scan` ✅ `foreground-20251019T052432Z.ndjson`
- Targeted checks: `npx eslint tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts` and `npx vitest run tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts` both pass.
- Added HTTP 429 throttling coverage to `tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts` (see `npx vitest run tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts` output above).
- Lane note: `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json` missing; following `support_task` molecules from `reports/manager/plan.json` instead.

### Weekly Support Health Snapshot (2025-10-18 UTC)
- Chatwoot: No newly recorded webhook failures in `artifacts/support` logs; retry policy now codified with structured logging (`scope="support.webhook"`).
- Agent SDK: `AGENT_SDK_URL` heartbeat unchanged; AI-Customer lane still integrating grading/learning signals.
- Escalations: SLA breach queue unchanged from prior report; CX has not flagged additional incidents during this window.
- Follow-ups:
  1. Pair with AI-Customer to feed grading/learning signals into support health report.
  2. Backfill AppProvider test harness for dashboard tiles to unblock `npm run test:ci`.
### Shutdown — 00:55 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #116 — PR: (none) — Branch: batch-20251019/content-brief-kpis
- DoD completion: ~60% (webhook retry helper/tests/runbook done; repo-wide lint/test debt pending cross-lane fix)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Added HTTP 429 retry coverage to support webhook integration tests.
  - Logged MCP traces and vitest evidence for retry slice.
  - Filed idle-state feedback packet for manager ingest.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: `npx vitest run tests/integration/support.webhook.spec.ts` (passes); heartbeat logs under `artifacts/support/2025-10-19/heartbeat/*.ndjson`.
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: repo_scan (support_webhook_retry.jsonl, support_webhook_service.jsonl, support_runbook.jsonl, support_webhook_tests_429.jsonl).

**Blockers**

- Repo lint failures (`npm run lint`) due to legacy unused globals/any types → **owner**: manager/QA lane — **ETA**: TBD after reassignment.
- `npm run test:ci` Polaris AppProvider gap in dashboard tile tests → **owner**: dashboard/UI lane — **ETA**: pending lane execution.

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Instrument webhook forwarder metrics via `recordDashboardFact` once scope cleared.
2. Coordinate with dashboard lane for AppProvider harness or receive updated allowed paths to address directly.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 3
- Evidence quality: 4
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 4
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 2

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Implemented retry helper and integration coverage without leaving allowed paths.
  2. Captured evidence and MCP traces for every substantive change.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Escalate blockers earlier instead of letting idle time accumulate.
  2. Maintain tighter response cadence during direction changes.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Saying I’m resuming work without immediately executing commands.
