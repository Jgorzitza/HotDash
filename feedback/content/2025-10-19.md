true

# Test results

[32mINF[0m no leaks found
```

**Definition of Done (from direction):**
- âœ… Fixtures + specs updated for production cadence
- âœ… `npm run fmt` (no errors in new files)
- âœ… `npm run lint` (no errors in new files)

## Coordination Plan: Content â†” Ads â†” Analytics

**Purpose:** Ensure content performance metrics flow correctly from analytics systems to content briefs and inform ad strategy.

**Content Agent Needs (from Ads/Analytics):**

1. **Weekly Metrics (from Analytics Agent):**
   - Post-level engagement (likes, comments, shares, saves)
   - Reach and impressions by platform
   - Click-through rates (CTR)
   - Conversion tracking (if linked to GA4)
   - Best performing time slots by platform

2. **Social Analytics (from Ads Agent):**
   - Publer post performance data
   - Platform-specific metrics (Instagram Insights, Facebook Analytics, TikTok Analytics)
   - Hashtag performance tracking
   - Audience demographics and behavior

**Content Agent Provides (to Ads/Analytics):**

1. **To Ads Agent:**
   - Content calendar and posting schedule
   - Copy approval status and CEO feedback/grades
   - Messaging themes and brand voice guidelines
   - Publer-ready drafts for approval queue

2. **To Analytics Agent:**
   - Content performance brief (weekly)
   - Idea pool status and priorities
   - Content type performance analysis
   - Recommendations based on engagement data

**Coordination Cadence:**

- **Weekly:** Exchange performance data on Monday morning
  - Analytics Agent provides previous week's metrics
  - Content Agent generates performance brief
  - Ads Agent reviews for campaign alignment

- **Daily:** Publer draft coordination
  - Content Agent creates drafts
  - Ads Agent validates platform optimization
  - CEO approves via HITL drawer

- **As-Needed:** Trend opportunities
  - Analytics/Ads Agent flags trending topics
  - Content Agent evaluates and creates wildcard idea
  - Fast-track approval for 48-72 hour trends

**Integration Points:**

1. **Supabase Tables:**
   - `content_performance` (analytics writes, content reads)
   - `product_suggestions` (content writes, analytics reads)
   - `trend_opportunities` (analytics writes, content reads)

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - Publer API: Health checks, post scheduling, performance retrieval
   - GA4: Conversion tracking, traffic sources
   - Social platform APIs: Native insights and metrics

**Success Metrics:**

- Performance brief generated weekly: â‰¥ 90% on-time delivery
- Metrics integration: < 24 hour lag from publish to brief inclusion
- Coordination blockers: â‰¤ 1 per week
- CEO approval time: â‰¤ 15 min (target maintained)

**Status:** Plan documented, awaiting analytics integration completion to begin data exchange.

- âœ… `feedback/content/2025-10-20.md` (this file)

## MCP Tools Used

- None required for this task (file verification, template creation, local operations)

## Code Quality Summary

**Format Check:** `npm run fmt` - âœ… All files formatted correctly
**Lint Check:** `npm run lint` - âœ… No errors in content agent files (pre-existing errors in unrelated component files)

## Escalation & Follow-up

**No blockers.** Ready for Manager review.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. Manager reviews feedback and weekly brief template
2. Analytics Agent integration completion enables data population
3. First weekly brief generation after 7 days of post performance data
4. Coordination with Ads Agent for Publer draft workflow testing
