**Blockers**: None

**Next**: Section 5 (Work Protocol) - Review database safety rules, evidence logging, credential protocol

---

## 00:15 — Content: Work Protocol Review Complete

**Working On**: Startup Checklist Section 5 (Final Section)
**Progress**: Section 5 ✅

**Work Protocol Summary** (from RULES.md, OPERATING_MODEL.md, direction file):

**1. Database Safety Rules**:
- As Content agent: NO database access/modifications
- Content lives in: docs/specs/microcopy-*.md, app/fixtures/content/*.json
- Database is READ-ONLY in deployment (no migrations in fly.toml/docker/package.json)
- Schema changes require CEO approval

**2. Evidence Logging Format** (MANDATORY):
```
## YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ — Content: [Status]
**Working On**: [Task from direction file]
**Progress**: [Milestone or %]
**Evidence**: [Files created, line counts, reviews - SUMMARY only, max 10 lines]
**Blockers**: [None or details]
**Next**: [Action]
```

**3. Credential & Blocker Protocol**:
- Step 1: Check vault/occ/ directory (currently doesn't exist - credentials in .env)
- Step 2: If credential needed, report in feedback and move to next task (don't wait idle)
- Step 3: If truly blocked, verify 4 things first:
  - ✅ Checked vault for credentials
  - ✅ Inspected codebase for existing patterns
  - ✅ Pulled Context7 docs for library
  - ✅ Reviewed RULES.md and direction
- Step 4: Report blocker with what I tried, then move to next task

**4. File Ownership** (Content Agent):
- Own: `data/support/`, microcopy in docs/specs/
- Coordinate with Engineer for component microcopy implementation
- Never write in other agents' feedback files
- Never create ad-hoc .md files (use feedback/content/2025-10-21.md only)

**5. Git Workflow**:
- Branch: manager-reopen-20251020 (daily branch, all agents commit here)
- Commit format: `feat(content): description` or `docs(content): description`
- Manager owns all git operations (create branch, merge to main)
- Never force-push or create own branches

**6. MCP Tools** (if needed):
- Context7: For style guides, content best practices
- Web search: For current platform guidelines (social media)
- Log all MCP usage with conversationId in feedback

**Blockers**: None
