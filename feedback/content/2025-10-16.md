## Content Agent — Daily Startup (2025-10-16)

Status: ACTIVE

Plan (per docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md):
- 0) Alignment: Skimmed NORTH_STAR, OPERATING_MODEL, RULES — all aligned. No conflicts found.
- 1) Direction & Issue: Read docs/directions/content.md — Current focus: Task 2 Social Post Drafting. Allowed path (for this task): app/services/content/post-drafter.ts. Awaiting the GitHub Issue link/ID with DoD + Allowed paths to proceed.
- 2) Tools & Env: For drafting service work today, no external MCP tool calls required (no posting; fixtures only in dev). Will keep MCP-first rule for any external adapters.
- 3) Sandbox: I will only touch app/services/content/post-drafter.ts once Issue confirms scope.
- 4) Feedback discipline: Logging commands/results here; will append blockers with exact outputs if any.

Context:
- post-drafter.ts already exists with placeholder implementation and hooks into engagement analyzer. Validates platform limits and provides optimization suggestions.

Next Intent:
- Pending Issue: Confirm DoD and Allowed paths for Task 2. Proposed DoD draft for manager confirmation:
  - [ ] draftPost produces platform-optimized draft honoring maxLength/tone/hashtags
  - [ ] validatePost returns errors/warnings correctly across platforms
  - [ ] optimizePost returns timing + hashtag suggestions using engagement insights
  - [ ] Unit tests added (if Issue allows tests/**)

Request for Manager:
- Please provide the GitHub Issue ID for “Task 2: Social Post Drafting” with:
  - Definition of Done
  - Acceptance checks
  - Allowed paths (consider including tests/** if tests are desired today)

Evidence:
- Read: docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md
- Read: docs/directions/content.md
- Checked file exists: app/services/content/post-drafter.ts

Blockers: None (awaiting Issue linkage before editing code per Single Ledger rule)
