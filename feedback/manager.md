# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-09

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Reconfirmed manager sprint focus (role alignment, secrets posture, Playwright regression gate, operator dry run coordination) per `docs/directions/manager.md`.
- Blocked: currently executing integrations workload and lack capacity/authority to drive full manager program; maintaining visibility through integration status updates while requesting dedicated manager support.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
## 2025-10-09 Cross-role Signals
- Updated every role feedback log with sprint kickoff entries; alignment verified, but multiple teams remain blocked by missing Supabase credentials/log exports and staging access packages.
- Designer, deployment, enablement, and reliability queues are still covered by integrations duties; need reassignment or capacity relief to keep sprint focus moving.
- QA to confirm retention plan for AI regression artifacts; decision pending before automation can target final storage path.
- Awaiting responses from reliability (Supabase secrets + monitor assets), QA (artifact storage), enablement/support/product (2025-10-16 dry run logistics), and infra (OCC-INF-221 GA MCP credentials); following up tomorrow if no updates.

- Cross-referenced each role’s updated direction log to ensure sprint focus work started; flagged outstanding blockers (monitoring assets, credentials) for follow-up.
- Coordinated escalation paths with reliability/data around Supabase monitoring/log export to keep mitigation thread moving; awaiting their updates before clearing OCC-212.
- Drafted notes for secrets posture check-in covering Supabase/Zoho rotation status so once reliability delivers plan it can be reviewed immediately.
- Logged daily sprint execution snippets across all role feedback files so progress and blockers are captured consistently; primary blockers remain Supabase monitor assets/log export, staging credential delivery, and launch window confirmation.
- Catalogued tangible outputs from each role’s kickoff (AI samples, compliance follow-up log, data insight scaffold, deployment pipeline review, designer annotations, engineer triage checklist, integrations readiness dashboard, QA Playwright plan, reliability synthetic check log) so manager sync can reference work underway without reopening each repo path.
- Enablement reported English-only audit completion, published Sales Pulse + CX Escalations modal job aids, and pinged product/support (14:35–14:36 ET) to lock the 2025-10-16 dry run agenda; design looped in for annotated visuals. Tracking responses due 2025-10-09 EOD; no replies yet as of 19:45 ET.
- 18:20 ET: preparing to push committed updates; still waiting on product/enablement staging access reply and reliability Supabase credential ETA before closing blockers.
- Filed the Supabase tabletop template (`docs/compliance/evidence/tabletop_supabase_scenario.md`) and the 2025-10-09 vendor follow-up log so compliance can capture drill evidence + DPA outreach as soon as responses land.
- 19:50 ET: Logged integrations prep work (GA MCP sync placeholder, reliability agenda, Hootsuite evidence scaffolding) and cross-linked blockers so manager/infra can act quickly once the 18:30 UTC sync wraps (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`, `docs/integrations/reliability_monitoring_agenda.md`, `artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/`).

## Deployment Push Status — 2025-10-09
- 19:55 ET: Final compliance + manager edits staged; pushing `main` immediately after this save so remote evidence stays current.

## 2025-10-08 — Sprint Focus Activation
- Cross-checked each role’s sprint focus against current feedback entries and logged coordination pings to keep deliverables aligned per `docs/directions/manager.md:24`.
- Opened thread with reliability to track Supabase/Zoho secret rotation schedule, supporting `docs/directions/manager.md:25`; awaiting their confirmed calendar.
- Reminded engineers to keep Playwright heading regression block in effect until new evidence bundle (Vitest + Playwright + Lighthouse) is attached per `docs/directions/manager.md:26`.
- Partnering with product/support/enablement to finalize the 2025-10-16 operator dry run logistics and ensure outcomes feed into Memory (`scope="ops"`) per `docs/directions/manager.md:27`.

## AI Escalations Update — 2025-10-09
- Direction refresh acknowledged; AI agent aligned on sprint focus (dry-run kit samples, daily regression hygiene, pilot readiness brief).
- Dry-run kit prep underway: drafting annotated CX escalation copy + sales pulse variants for docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/; regression artifacts now emitted under artifacts/ai/ for QA handoff.
- Blockers: Supabase credentials (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) still pending so decision logs persist beyond in-memory fallback; QA storage target for prompt regression artifacts TBD; `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS` remains off pending those inputs.
- Requests: 1) Manager to chase reliability for Supabase secrets + confirm storage plan with QA, 2) advise on long-term artifact retention owner, 3) green-light timeline for enabling `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS` once dependencies land.
- Next actions: maintain daily `npm run ai:regression` cadence with qualitative notes in feedback/ai.md; finalize pilot readiness brief with guardrails + go/no-go criteria for product/compliance review.


## Support / CX Escalations Update — 2025-10-09
- Direction refresh acknowledged; support aligned on sprint focus (CX Escalations modal validation, English-only collateral upkeep, dry run logistics).
- Preparing updated runbook screenshots once staging seed is ready; English-only template review cadence continues.
- Blocked on product confirmation of the 2025-10-16 dry run slot and staging access needed for validation evidence.
- Awaiting seeded conversations to regression-test Chatwoot heuristics beyond current unit coverage.
- 10:45 ET: pinged product + enablement on Slack requesting dry-run confirmation and staging access ETA; awaiting response.
- Expanded shipping/refund keyword coverage in Chatwoot heuristics and added regression tests to cover fallback + tag-only scenarios (run: `npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/chatwoot.escalations.spec.ts`).
- Added Pending Validation checklist to `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md` so staging evidence can be captured immediately after access is restored.

## Integrations Status — 2025-10-09
- GA MCP credentials still blocked on OCC-INF-221; manager/infra sync at 18:30 UTC remains the decision point for host + secret ETA. Onboarding checklist in `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md` ready for immediate update once results land.
- Reliability monitoring sync agenda drafted with provisional Hootsuite vs native API rate-limit thresholds; HS-44721 doc needed to finalize and circulate ahead of the 17:00 UTC meeting (`docs/integrations/reliability_monitoring_agenda.md`).
- Hootsuite compliance packet evidence remains placeholders (`artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/`); waiting on order form, SLA addendum, and security questionnaire before the 16:00 UTC DPIA review.
- Upcoming actions and blockers tracked in `feedback/integrations.md`; poised to log infra outcome, drop vendor artifacts, and publish final monitoring thresholds upon receipt.

## Marketing Update — 2025-10-09
- Launch comms packet updated with approval tracker and character-count guardrails for banner/email/blog so product can sign off on English-only copy without rework (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`).
- New support training script drafted for the 2025-10-16 dry run; aligns walkthrough with FAQ and flags pending staging credentials (`docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md`).
- Launch timeline playbook published with relative T- milestones, KPIs, and risk matrix pending product launch date (`docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md`).
- Awaiting product launch window confirmation (blocks calendar locking) and design tooltip annotations (due Oct 8 @ 12:00 ET). Localization ask paused per manager direction unless product reopens multi-language scope.
- Ask: Can marketing drive the support training invite cadence directly, or should enablement own scheduling once slots are confirmed?

## Deployment Pipeline Status — 2025-10-09
- Re-read the refreshed deployment direction (`docs/directions/deployment.md`, sprint focus 2025-10-08) and confirmed our deliverables: staging pipeline, env matrix, prod go-live checklist, and Postgres staging configuration.
- Staging deployment workflow remains healthy (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`) and continues to gate on smoke/Lighthouse artifacts via `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`; runbook guidance is live in `docs/runbooks/deployment_staging.md` for operator dry runs.
- Production workflow draft (`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`) and CLI wrapper (`scripts/deploy/production-deploy.sh`) are ready, but we cannot schedule a rehearsal until GitHub `production` environment secrets and reviewers are configured.
- Environment + secrets matrix (`docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`) and go-live checklist (`docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md`) remain current; no delta from reliability yet on the pending secret rows.
- Postgres-backed staging/test database provisioning plan is documented (`docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md`, `prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`) but still waiting on reliability to wire credentials so QA can begin migration rollback drills.
- Authored `docs/deployment/production_environment_setup.md` covering vault provisioning, `gh` secret automation, Shopify CLI token generation, and required reviewer configuration; circulating to reliability + repo admins today.
- Added `scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh` so we can automatically verify GitHub environment coverage once reliability confirms secrets.
- 09:40 ET: Shared the playbook + checker with reliability and repo admins; awaiting acknowledgment plus vault references for production secrets and staged Postgres credentials.

## Compliance Update — 2025-10-09
- Direction refresh acknowledged; sprint focus remains data inventory upkeep, Supabase incident readiness, and vendor DPA audit (see `feedback/compliance.md` 2025-10-09 entry).
- Supabase incident runbook published (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`) with companion tabletop template drafted at `docs/compliance/evidence/tabletop_supabase_scenario.md`; awaiting reliability/support confirmation on scenario scope and drill date.
- Retention automation blocked on reliability deploying Supabase `pg_cron` jobs and sharing first-run logs; follow-up booked for 2025-10-10 14:00 ET, evidence to land under `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/`.
- Vendor DPAs/residency attestations still pending for GA MCP, Supabase, Anthropic (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`); 2025-10-09 reminder log captured in `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-09.md`, second reminder wave queued for 2025-10-10 AM.
- Requests: 1) Manager to escalate vendor legal contacts for signed DPAs/residency statements, 2) Reliability to prioritize cron rollout + deliver logs, 3) Support to confirm tabletop participation so we can lock drill date.

### Outstanding Dependencies
1. Reliability to load Shopify, Supabase, and smoke test secrets into the GitHub `production` environment and document vault paths in `feedback/reliability.md` (refs `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md` rows 73-101).
2. Repo admins to enforce manager + reliability as required reviewers on the GitHub `production` environment so the workflow matches the go-live checklist.
3. Shopify service account credentials to generate `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_PROD` and unblock the final GitHub secret population.

### Upcoming Actions
- Share the production environment setup playbook with reliability + repo admins and capture sign-off on owners/dates.
- Track reliability handoff and, once secrets land, validate the production smoke target + update the env matrix status column.
- Coordinate with repo admins to flip on environment reviewers and document the approval flow in the go-live checklist.
- Run the new `scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh` after provisioning to confirm coverage and attach the output to `feedback/deployment.md`.
- Stage the Shopify CLI token generation steps so we can populate the secret immediately after credentials arrive, then schedule a dry-run dispatch.
- Draft env-check output template + QA rollback handoff notes so we can publish the results immediately when secrets land.
- Escalate if reliability/admin ETAs slip beyond 2025-10-09; otherwise continue async logging in `feedback/deployment.md`.
- Confirmed push health; ready to resume deployment evidence logging once reliability delivers the pending secrets.

# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-08

## Deployment Pipeline Status — 2025-10-08
- **Staging pipeline online:** Added `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` with verify → deploy jobs and Shopify CLI orchestration via `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`, emitting Playwright, Lighthouse, and synthetic smoke artifacts. Documentation captured in `docs/runbooks/deployment_staging.md` (overview references production hand-off).
- **Production workflow drafted:** `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` enforces manual dispatch with release tag, go-live checklist link, and manager/reliability approvers; wraps `scripts/deploy/production-deploy.sh` plus Lighthouse + smoke evidence.
- **Readiness docs published:** Environment matrix now tracks prod secret provisioning and smoke budgets (`docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`), and go-live checklist aligns with the new workflow inputs and performance targets (`docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md`).
- **Status log updated:** `feedback/deployment.md` reflects direction acknowledgement, shipped artifacts, outstanding risks, and next actions.
- **Outstanding needs:** Reliability to populate GitHub `production` environment secrets by 2025-10-09, repo admins to set environment reviewers, deployment to generate service Shopify CLI token once creds land (see follow-ups in env matrix + deployment log).

## Engineer Direction Sync — 2025-10-08
- Engineer acknowledged the refreshed docs/directions/engineer.md focus (Supabase sync remediation, Postgres staging enablement, modal polish, telemetry wiring).
- Action: Added `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` and wired parity script guidance so data/reliability can create the Supabase `facts` table without guesswork; script now emits a `supabase.facts_table_missing` status on `PGRST205`.
- Status: Feature flag module restored (`app/config/featureFlags.ts`) with unit coverage; targeted `npm run test:unit` specs now pass.
- Status: Lighthouse runner now consumes `LIGHTHOUSE_TARGET` or `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL`; awaiting staging secret hookup to resume evidence uploads.

## AI Escalation Enablement — Outstanding Requirements
- **Supabase credentials:** `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` are still unset on the AI workstation. `getSupabaseConfig()` now loads `.env`, but without real values decision logs remain in the in-memory fallback and never sync to Supabase/Memory MCP. Requesting staging (or prod-ready) credentials so we can validate persistence before the M1 dry run.
- **QA artifact storage:** Prompt regression now auto-writes JSON artifacts to `artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-<timestamp>.json`. QA needs the canonical destination for bundling these with Playwright evidence. Please confirm if we keep them under `artifacts/ai/` in repo, publish to an external bucket, or adjust CI to collect them.
- **Kill switch coordination:** `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS` defaults to `0`. Turn it on per environment (`FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS=1`) once Supabase logging is active and QA has the artifact flow in place; otherwise the modal ships template-only.

## Compliance Update — 2025-10-08
- **Direction ack:** Re-read `docs/directions/compliance.md`; sprint focus confirmed (data inventory refresh, Supabase incident response, vendor DPA audit). Logged acknowledgement + blockers in `feedback/compliance.md`.
- **Artifacts live:** Data inventory + retention plan refreshed (`docs/compliance/data_inventory.md`, `docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md`). New Supabase incident runbook drafted (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`); needs reliability + support review prior to tabletop scheduling.
- **Evidence captured:** Vendor outreach + purge evidence stored (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-08.md`, `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/2025-10-08_purge_log.json` placeholder pending cron output). DPIA + notice updates remain current.
- **Open risks:**
  - R2 (Vendor DPAs) — Missing executed agreements + residency attestations for GA MCP, Supabase, Anthropic (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`).
  - R1 (Retention automations) — Supabase `pg_cron` deployment + first-run evidence outstanding; reliability coordination required per `docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md`.
- **Asks:** 1) Manager to secure vendor signatures/responses, 2) Reliability to schedule cron rollout + share logs, 3) Support to validate runbook scope + confirm tabletop participation.

## Support / CX Escalations Update — 2025-10-08
- **Template heuristics shipped:** Chatwoot escalations service now picks `ship_update`, `refund_offer`, or `ack_delay` based on tags/message keywords and renders customer names before approval flows. Unit tests updated to cover the paths (`app/services/chatwoot/escalations.ts`, `tests/unit/chatwoot.escalations.spec.ts`).
- **Label alignment:** Escalation action now tags conversations with `escalation` (was `escalated`) to match SOP terminology and runbook guidance (`app/routes/actions/chatwoot.escalate.ts`).
- **Runbook refresh:** Added annotated modal screenshots, approval heuristics, greeting checks, and validation notes so operators train against the live flow (`docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md`).
- **Outstanding items:** Product still owes confirmation on the 2025-10-16 dry run (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`). French template localization declared out-of-scope; localization cadence paused unless requirements change.
- **Risks:** Heuristics rely on simple keyword detection; needs real-conversation validation post-staging seed. Modal still lacks template editing—operators must escalate when suggestions misfit.

## Data Update — 2025-10-08
- Direction refresh acknowledged in `feedback/data.md`; sprint focus locked on Supabase decision sync reliability, weekly insight addendum, and GA MCP readiness.
- Supabase spike investigation: instrumentation diff ready, but blocked until reliability provides Supabase retry/error logs plus a valid `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to reproduce the 25% failure rate in staging. Tracking alongside reliability pairing request.
- Weekly insight addendum: narrative outline drafted; waiting on tonight's activation/SLA ETL to populate charts prior to attaching notebook links in `docs/insights/` by 2025-10-09 noon ET.
- GA MCP readiness: coordination brief issued (`feedback/data_to_integrations_coordination.md`), pending integrations/compliance to confirm credential handoff window before executing `docs/data/ga_mcp_go_live_checklist.md` Step 1 parity checks.
- Follow-ups sent 2025-10-08 to reliability (Supabase logs + service key) and integrations/compliance (credential ETA + evidence acknowledgment); escalation windows set for 19:00/20:00 UTC respectively if no response (`feedback/data_to_reliability_coordination.md`, `feedback/data_to_integrations_coordination.md`).
- Escalations triggered to manager/reliability and manager/integrations/compliance requesting immediate delivery of Supabase artifacts and GA MCP credential plan; awaiting responses to unblock readiness workstreams.

## Cross-Role Check-in — 2025-10-09
- AI/Data/Engineer streams paused pending reliability’s Supabase log export and staging `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`; escalations logged with 2025-10-09 deadlines for delivery (`feedback/data_to_reliability_coordination.md`).
- GA MCP credential ETA and compliance acknowledgment still outstanding after escalation; integrations to report OCC-INF-221 outcome before EOD so parity checklist can proceed (`feedback/data_to_integrations_coordination.md`).
- Designer ready with static component handoff/tooltip annotations once Figma access and staging screenshots land; enablement awaiting assets for job aids.
- Deployment workflows prepped but production rehearsal blocked on GitHub `production` secrets and reviewer gating; playbook delivered to reliability/admin for action.
- QA/Support/Enablement/Marketing logs refreshed; each waiting on upstream signals (staging seeds, launch window, dry run confirmations) to close sprint deliverables.

# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-07

- Refresh sprint focus in `docs/directions/ai.md`, `docs/directions/data.md`, `docs/directions/designer.md`, `docs/directions/engineer.md`, `docs/directions/marketing.md`, `docs/directions/product.md`, `docs/directions/qa.md`, `docs/directions/reliability.md`, and `docs/directions/support.md` to align with the M1/M2 check-in and the English-only scope.
- Added direction coverage for Compliance, Deployment, Integrations, and Enablement (`docs/directions/compliance.md`, `docs/directions/deployment.md`, `docs/directions/integrations.md`, `docs/directions/enablement.md`) so every role has current marching orders.
- Updated AI and QA sprint focus (2025-10-08) to reflect regression evidence sharing, Supabase logging dependencies, and dry-run preparation.
- All agents must review the updated direction doc for their role, acknowledge in their feedback log today, and raise blockers ahead of the 2025-10-08 sync.
- Reminder: Manager direction updates now land in `feedback/manager.md`. When you need the latest assignments or sprint focus, check this file first.

## Summary
- Playwright gate is green again (21/21 unit tests, 7/7 Playwright) after the engineer landed the accessible heading and modal flows; reliability confirms CI stability.
- CX Escalations and Sales Pulse modals plus Supabase Memory analytics logging are live, unlocking QA coverage and operator dry-run prep.
- Data delivered the first weekly insight packet and Supabase monitoring brief; reliability staged synthetic checks and artifact retention.
- Data insight highlights for operator readiness: Sales activation dipped 30% vs. baseline (critical anomaly) per `docs/insights/weekly_2025-10-07.md:31`, Chatwoot SLA breach rate holding at 50% warning per `docs/insights/weekly_2025-10-07.md:75`, and GA traffic anomaly alerts flag `/blogs/news/october-launch` at -27% WoW per `docs/insights/weekly_2025-10-07.md:100` — prep follow-up playbooks before live swap.
- Demo shop seeds now cover Evergreen Outfitters, Belle Maison Décor, and Peak Performance Gear via `npm run seed` (multi-domain support in `prisma/seeds/dashboard-facts.seed.ts:1`), and GA MCP parity harness (`scripts/analytics/ga-mcp-schema-check.ts:1`) plus baseline artifact `artifacts/ga/mock_schema.json:1` are ready for credential hand-off to integrations/compliance.
- Coordination brief issued to integrations & compliance (`feedback/data_to_integrations_coordination.md:1`) capturing the T0 go-live window (seed run, parity check, Supabase alert verification) so credential delivery can move directly into checklist execution.
- AI prompt regression and logging services are ready; awaiting go/no-go on live generation pending M1/M2 alignment.

## Blockers / Risks
- Supabase decision sync monitor now wired to real logs; first run showed **25% error rate (critical)** — reliability + data need root cause and mitigation.
- GA MCP credentials still pending, keeping analytics in mock mode.
- Designer remains blocked on Figma workspace access, delaying the shared component library.

## Actions & Assignments
- **Engineer**: Resolve the Supabase decision sync failures with data/reliability collaboration, bring up the Postgres staging configuration for QA, finish accessibility polish on CX Escalations/Sales Pulse modals, and rerun Vitest/Playwright/Lighthouse with artifacts attached.
- **Designer**: Deliver the shared component library (or static handoff) with status icon assets, annotate tooltip/focus flows for engineering, and supply visuals for enablement’s CX Escalations/Sales Pulse job aids.
- **QA**: Extend Playwright coverage to modal approval flows (including AI suggestion states), validate migrations on SQLite + staging Postgres when deployment provides access, verify Supabase logging outputs with AI/reliability, and log the combined evidence bundle in `feedback/qa.md`.
- **Data**: Lead the Supabase incident analysis (root cause + instrumentation), publish the 2025-10-09 insight addendum covering activation/SLA/anomaly trends, and finalize GA MCP readiness materials for integrations/compliance handoff.
- **Reliability**: Drive Supabase mitigation and alert automation, run the synthetic check workflow daily with logged metrics, and ship the 2025-10-10 secret rotation plan while prepping prerequisites for the Week 3 backup drill.
- **AI**: Assemble the operator dry-run AI kit (annotated suggestions stored under enablement), keep regression artifacts flowing to QA, and finalize the pilot readiness brief with guardrails/killswitch details before the M1/M2 checkpoint.
- **Marketing**: Lock English-only launch comms with product sign-off, hand the operator FAQ/training script to enablement/support, and publish the launch timeline playbook with KPI checkpoints.
- **Product**: Refresh the Linear backlog with Supabase/dry-run/telemetry work, assign metric owners, and finalize the 2025-10-16 operator dry run plan with enablement/support, logging decisions in Memory (scope `ops`).
- **Support**: Update runbooks/templates for English-only messaging, validate the live modal workflows against SOPs, and coordinate dry run logistics with enablement/product (Q&A captured).
- **Enablement** (Marie Dubois): Audit training materials for localization remnants, produce Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids, and own operator dry run logistics; track progress in `feedback/enablement.md`.
- **Compliance** (Casey Lin): Publish the OCC data inventory, author the Supabase incident response runbook with reliability/support input, and summarize vendor agreement follow-ups in `feedback/compliance.md`.
- **Deployment** (Devon Ortiz): Stand up the staging pipeline, provision the Postgres test database, document the environment/secrets matrix, and draft the production go-live checklist with rollback gates.
- **Integrations** (Priya Singh): Secure GA MCP credentials or documented ETA, recommend the social sentiment vendor path with marketing/reliability, and share the integration readiness dashboard before the checkpoint.

- Grid layout uses .occ-tile-grid CSS class
- Test IDs added for e2e testing (testId prop on TileCard)

### Ready for Next Phase
- Component structure ready for modal implementations
- Design token system in place for consistent styling
- Session tracking foundation for analytics

## Designer Sprint Update (2025-10-06)

### Completed Deliverables
1. **Design QA Report** (feedback/design_qa_report.md)
   - Validated engineer's tile implementation: PASS (100% token compliance)
   - Identified P0 accessibility issues (ARIA attributes, focus indicators needed)
   - Provided actionable recommendations

2. **High-Fidelity Modal Layouts** (docs/design/wireframes/modal_layouts.md)
   - CX Escalation, Inventory Alert, SEO Anomaly modals
   - All states: default, loading, success, error, empty
   - Complete CSS implementation + ARIA markup
   - Focus trap TypeScript code
   - Responsive behavior specifications

3. **Copy Deck - Modals (English-only)** (docs/design/copy_deck_modals.md)
   - 100+ modal/toast strings (EN)
   - Character count analysis + layout warnings
   - Responsive button text strategy

### Sprint Status: 75% Complete (3/4 goals)
- ✓ Paired with engineer on tile demo
- ✓ Delivered modal layouts
- ✓ Provided copy updates with layout flags
- ⏳ Figma library (blocked on workspace access)

### Key Findings
- **Token integration:** Excellent (no hardcoded values)
- **P0 accessibility gaps:** ARIA attributes, focus indicators, status icons
- **Button label overflow:** Identified several long-form phrases that need shortening for mobile
- **Modal implementation:** Estimated 3-5 day effort (recommend phased approach)

### Designer Recommendations
1. Prioritize P0 modals (CX Escalation + toasts) for M2
2. Budget for external a11y audit after M2 or provide NVDA training

## Next Actions
- Engineer: Implement P0 accessibility fixes (ARIA, focus indicators, status icons)
- Engineer: Begin CX Escalation modal + toast system (prioritize over all 3 modals)
- Designer: Support modal implementation (pairing session recommended)
- Designer: Create Figma library (when workspace access granted)
- QA: Define test cases based on accessibility criteria + modal states
- QA: Validate design token implementation against tokens.css
- Product: Review copy deck for tone and confirm English-only messaging

## Engineering Status — 2025-10-08

### Completed
- TileCard now exposes focusable `<article>` regions with `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby`, polite timestamp announcements, and status icons (app/components/tiles/TileCard.tsx#L62).
- Added dashboard-level manual refresh control calling `/app/actions/dashboard.refresh`, with aria-live status messaging and loader revalidation (app/routes/app._index.tsx#L44, app/routes/actions/dashboard.refresh.ts#L24).
- Persisted refresh triggers to Prisma facts and mirrored to Supabase with structured latency/error logs covering view/refresh/get operations (app/routes/actions/dashboard.refresh.ts#L24, app/services/analytics.server.ts#L22).
- Authored analytics parity script comparing Prisma vs Supabase counts and exposed npm script (`npm run ops:check-analytics-parity`) for Ops hand-off (scripts/ops/check-dashboard-analytics-parity.ts#L1, package.json#L18).
- Delivered Postgres staging/test database scaffolding: new Prisma schema + npm helpers (`prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`, `db:*:postgres` scripts), `.env.staging.example`, and runbook (`docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md`) with environment matrix cross-link.

### Evidence
- Vitest: `npm run test:unit` → blocked by missing `app/config/featureFlags.ts` import in existing chatwoot specs (pre-existing repo gap).
- Targeted Vitest: `npx vitest run tests/unit/supabase.config.spec.ts` ✅
- Playwright: `npm run test:e2e` (7/7 green)
- Parity probe: `npm run ops:check-analytics-parity` → highlights Supabase unconfigured locally (requires credentials)
- Lighthouse: still gated by missing `LIGHTHOUSE_TARGET`; script exits early pending target definition

### Blockers / Requests
- Need `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` for parity check to validate counts (<1% delta) before sign-off.
- Require confirmed Lighthouse target URL to regenerate accessibility/perf artifact for the evidence bundle.

## Marketing Update — 2025-10-07
- Finalized launch comms copy per product approvals (banner/email/blog, EN & FR) and documented decisions in `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md`.
- Updated tooltip handoff + localization request; awaiting design annotations (due Oct 8 @ 12:00 ET) and FR review (due Oct 9 @ 18:00 ET).
- Published October campaign calendar with KPI targets; holding distribution scheduling until product locks launch date tomorrow.

## Marketing Update — 2025-10-07 (EOD)
- Launch comms now match product-approved copy (banner/email/blog/tooltip) with FR variants captured for localization confirmation.
- Tooltip placement pending designer annotations (due Oct 8 @ 12:00 ET); localization reviewing "Centre OCC" abbreviation by Oct 9.
- Campaign calendar drafted with KPI targets and will be locked once product confirms launch date tomorrow.

## Compliance Update — 2025-10-08 (Detailed)
- **Deliverables completed**
  - Data inventory & retention matrix (`docs/compliance/data_inventory.md`) documenting flows across Shopify, Chatwoot, Supabase, GA MCP, Anthropic, caches, and forthcoming Hootsuite tile with retention targets/classifications.
  - Incident response runbook for breach scenarios (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_breach.md`) covering detection → notification → recovery with GDPR/CCPA compliance and evidence handling.
  - Retention automation plan + tooling (`docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md`, new purge script `scripts/ops/purge-dashboard-data.ts`, npm task `npm run ops:purge-dashboard-data`). Baseline run output archived at `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/2025-10-08_purge_log.json`; Supabase cron SQL draft ready (`docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/retention/cron_setup.sql`).
  - DPIA for Chatwoot transcripts & Anthropic prompts (`docs/compliance/dpia_chatwoot_anthropic.md`) with mitigation requirements (prompt sanitizer, opt-out toggle, vendor DPAs).
  - Privacy notice alignment: update deck (`docs/compliance/privacy_notice_updates.md`), launch FAQ disclosures (`docs/marketing/launch_faq.md`), rollout plan (`docs/marketing/privacy_toggle_rollout.md`), and publication-ready notice copy (`docs/compliance/evidence/privacy_notice/operator_notice_v2025-10-08.md`).
- **Vendor contracts & evidence tracking**
  - Request templates + status tracker published (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_requests.md`, `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`).
  - Initial outreach logged for GA MCP, Supabase, Anthropic (2025-10-07) with follow-ups recorded 2025-10-08 (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-08.md`). Awaiting ticket numbers—need escalation if no replies by 2025-10-10.
- **Blockers needing manager support**
  1. Vendor DPAs absent → production launch blocked until documents archived in evidence folders.
  2. Analytics opt-out toggle + AI prompt sanitizer unbuilt; both are prerequisites from DPIA before enabling GA MCP or Anthropic in production.
  3. Supabase retention cron deployment pending reliability resourcing; without it we rely on manual purge script runs.
- **Action requests**
  - Push vendors/partners for DPA packages and residency assurances.
  - Prioritize engineering work on opt-out toggle (Settings → Privacy) and prompt sanitizer this sprint.
  - Coordinate reliability to implement Supabase pg_cron jobs using provided SQL and capture first-run evidence.
- **Upcoming deadlines**
  - 2025-10-12: Publish privacy notice + opt-out messaging, update support documentation.
  - 2025-10-14: Retention automations operational and vendor DPAs on file (see R1/R2 in `feedback/compliance.md`).
  - 2025-10-16: Re-run DPIA after mitigations for Anthropic go-live decision.
