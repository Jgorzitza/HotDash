# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- Established Operator Control Center north-star plan and scoped v1 tile lineup across CX, sales, inventory, and SEO.
- Authored technical designs for Shopify services, Chatwoot tile, GA ingest (mock-first) plus Prisma migration plan.
- Landed CI scaffolding (Vitest, Playwright, Lighthouse) and schema additions for dashboard facts + decisions.
- Implemented Shopify/Chatwoot/GA service layers with caching + Prisma persistence, approval action, and unit tests.
- Published role direction docs (engineer, designer, QA, product, data, AI, reliability, marketing, support) to synchronize evidence policy across agents.
- Added direction governance (docs/directions/README.md) and Supabase credential gate in CI (scripts/ci/check-supabase.mjs) to keep Memory persistent.
- **Designer completed full UX deliverables** — wireframes, tokens, accessibility criteria, copy deck, and visual hierarchy review.
- **Engineer refactored dashboard components** — extracted tile components, implemented design tokens (tokens.css), added dashboard session tracking.

## Blockers / Risks
- GA MCP host still pending; currently operating in mock mode.
- ~~No design assets yet; need UX partner or timebox for wireframes.~~ ✓ RESOLVED: Complete design package delivered.
- Figma library link pending (designer to create and share).

## Engineering Progress Update (2025-10-05)

### Components Refactored
- Dashboard route refactored with modular tile components (app/routes/app._index.tsx)
- Created tile component library: app/components/tiles
  - TileCard (wrapper component)
  - SalesPulseTile
  - FulfillmentHealthTile
  - InventoryHeatmapTile
  - CXEscalationsTile
  - SEOContentTile
- Implemented design tokens in tokens.css using designer specifications

### Design Token Integration Status
- ✓ Spacing tokens applied (--occ-space-*)
- ✓ Border tokens applied (--occ-border-*, --occ-radius-*)
- ✓ Background tokens applied (--occ-bg-*)
- ✓ Text color tokens applied (--occ-text-*)
- Grid layout uses .occ-tile-grid CSS class
- Test IDs added for e2e testing (testId prop on TileCard)

### Ready for Next Phase
- Component structure ready for modal implementations
- Design token system in place for consistent styling
- Session tracking foundation for analytics

## Next Actions
- Engineer: Implement tile detail modals per wireframes (CX Escalations, Inventory prioritized)
- Engineer: Add accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, focus management) per docs/design/accessibility_criteria.md
- Designer: Create Figma component library and share link
- QA: Define test cases based on accessibility criteria
- QA: Validate design token implementation against tokens.css
- Product: Review copy deck for tone and messaging alignment
