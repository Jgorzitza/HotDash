# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- Established Operator Control Center north-star plan and scoped v1 tile lineup across CX, sales, inventory, and SEO.
- Authored technical designs for Shopify services, Chatwoot tile, GA ingest (mock-first) plus Prisma migration plan.
- Landed CI scaffolding (Vitest, Playwright, Lighthouse) and schema additions for dashboard facts + decisions.
- Implemented Shopify/Chatwoot/GA service layers with caching + Prisma persistence, approval action, and unit tests.
- Published role direction docs (engineer, designer, QA, product, data, AI, reliability, marketing, support) to synchronize evidence policy across agents.
- Added direction governance (docs/directions/README.md) and Supabase credential gate in CI (scripts/ci/check-supabase.mjs) to keep Memory persistent.
- **Designer completed full UX deliverables** — wireframes, tokens, accessibility criteria, copy deck, and visual hierarchy review.
- **Engineer refactored dashboard components** — extracted tile components, implemented design tokens (tokens.css), added dashboard session tracking.
- Updated sprint focus for all agents (docs/directions/*) to target Playwright fix, tile modals, insight packet, and launch comms before 2025-10-08 check-in.

## Blockers / Risks
- GA MCP host still pending; currently operating in mock mode.
- ~~No design assets yet; need UX partner or timebox for wireframes.~~ ✓ RESOLVED: Complete design package delivered.
- Figma library link pending (designer to create and share).

## Engineering Progress Update (2025-10-05)

### Components Refactored
- Dashboard route refactored with modular tile components (app/routes/app._index.tsx)
- Created tile component library: app/components/tiles
  - TileCard (wrapper component)
  - SalesPulseTile
  - FulfillmentHealthTile
  - InventoryHeatmapTile
  - CXEscalationsTile
  - SEOContentTile
- Implemented design tokens in tokens.css using designer specifications
- Updated dashboard to use CSS custom properties (--occ-* prefix)
- Added dashboard session tracking service (recordDashboardSessionOpen)

### Design Token Integration Status
- ✓ Spacing tokens applied (--occ-space-*)
- ✓ Border tokens applied (--occ-border-*, --occ-radius-*)
- ✓ Background tokens applied (--occ-bg-*)
- ✓ Text color tokens applied (--occ-text-*)
- Grid layout uses .occ-tile-grid CSS class
- Test IDs added for e2e testing (testId prop on TileCard)

### Ready for Next Phase
- Component structure ready for modal implementations
- Design token system in place for consistent styling
- Session tracking foundation for analytics

## Designer Sprint Update (2025-10-06)

### Completed Deliverables
1. **Design QA Report** (feedback/design_qa_report.md)
   - Validated engineer's tile implementation: PASS (100% token compliance)
   - Identified P0 accessibility issues (ARIA attributes, focus indicators needed)
   - Provided actionable recommendations

2. **High-Fidelity Modal Layouts** (docs/design/wireframes/modal_layouts.md)
   - CX Escalation, Inventory Alert, SEO Anomaly modals
   - All states: default, loading, success, error, empty
   - Complete CSS implementation + ARIA markup
   - Focus trap TypeScript code
   - Responsive behavior specifications

3. **Localized Copy Deck - Modals** (docs/design/copy_deck_modals.md)
   - 100+ modal/toast strings (EN/FR)
   - Character count analysis + layout warnings
   - 5 critical French label fixes identified
   - Responsive button text strategy

### Sprint Status: 75% Complete (3/4 goals)
- ✓ Paired with engineer on tile demo
- ✓ Delivered modal layouts
- ✓ Provided copy updates with layout flags
- ⏳ Figma library (blocked on workspace access)

### Key Findings
- **Token integration:** Excellent (no hardcoded values)
- **P0 accessibility gaps:** ARIA attributes, focus indicators, status icons
- **French label overflow:** 5 critical cases need shortening
- **Modal implementation:** Estimated 3-5 day effort (recommend phased approach)

### Designer Recommendations
1. Prioritize P0 modals (CX Escalation + toasts) for M2
2. Engage translation service by 2025-10-07 for French label review
3. Budget for external a11y audit after M2 or provide NVDA training

## Next Actions
- Engineer: Implement P0 accessibility fixes (ARIA, focus indicators, status icons)
- Engineer: Begin CX Escalation modal + toast system (prioritize over all 3 modals)
- Designer: Support modal implementation (pairing session recommended)
- Designer: Create Figma library (when workspace access granted)
- QA: Define test cases based on accessibility criteria + modal states
- QA: Validate design token implementation against tokens.css
- Product: Review copy deck for tone and approve French label abbreviations
- Product: Engage translation service for French string review (P1)
