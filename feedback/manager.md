# MANAGER Agent Feedback

## Database-Driven Feedback Process

**CRITICAL**: This file is for reference only. All actual feedback goes to the database via `logDecision()`.

### How to Log Progress

```typescript
import { logDecision } from '~/services/decisions.server';

await logDecision({
  scope: 'build',
  actor: 'manager',
  taskId: 'TASK-ID',
  status: 'in_progress', // pending | in_progress | completed | blocked | cancelled
  progressPct: 50,
  action: 'task_progress',
  rationale: 'What you did + evidence',
  evidenceUrl: 'artifacts/manager/2025-10-23/task.md',
  payload: {
    commits: ['abc123f'],
    files: [{ path: 'app/routes/dashboard.tsx', lines: 45, type: 'modified' }],
    tests: { overall: '22/22 passing' }
  }
});
```

### When to Log

- ✅ Task started (status: 'in_progress')
- ✅ Task completed (status: 'completed') - IMMEDIATE
- ✅ Task blocked (status: 'blocked') - IMMEDIATE
- ✅ Blocker cleared (status: 'in_progress') - IMMEDIATE
- ✅ Every 2 hours if still working on same task

### Manager Queries

Manager can see your progress via:
- `scripts/manager/query-blocked-tasks.ts`
- `scripts/manager/query-agent-status.ts`
- `scripts/manager/query-completed-today.ts`

  - Cannot reach Supabase pooler at `mmbjiyhsvniqxibzgyvx.pooler.supabase.com:5432`
  - Attempted fixes: IPv4→hostname, manager credentials, different configs - ALL FAILED
  - Root cause: Network connectivity issue or Supabase service disruption
  - Impact: Cannot query agent status or log decisions to database

**Workaround**:
- Using existing reports for coordination:
  - `reports/manager/2025-10-23-comprehensive-status.md` (50 tasks completed)
  - `reports/manager/2025-10-23-cycle-summary.md`
  - Individual agent feedback files in `feedback/` directory

**Next Actions**:
1. ✅ Database connection review attempted (BLOCKED - escalate to CEO)
2. ✅ Continue with Growth Engine Phase coordination using available data
3. Monitor agent progress via feedback files
4. Escalate database connectivity issue to CEO

**Database Status**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Using feedback files as fallback

#### 16:04 UTC - Database Connection RESTORED + Blocker Cleared

**Database Fix**:
- ✅ Reverted to working configuration: `aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543`

**Blocker Cleared**:
- ✅ Fixed `app/utils/analytics.ts` duplicate exports (QA-HELPER blocker)
- ✅ Removed redundant export block (lines 387-419)
- ✅ QA-HELPER can now proceed with UI component tests

**Commits**:
