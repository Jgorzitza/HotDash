### üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX (P0 - BLOCKS FUNCTIONALITY)

**Issue #1: Missing Button & Modal CSS**
- **Problem**: Classes `.occ-button--*`, `.occ-modal__*` are referenced but not defined
- **Impact**: Modals and buttons will not display correctly
- **Fix**: Create `app/styles/components.css` with provided code
- **Priority**: P0 (Blocking)
- **Estimated Time**: 15 minutes (copy/paste + import)

**Issue #2: Missing Focus Indicators**
- **Problem**: No visible focus outlines for keyboard navigation
- **Impact**: WCAG 2.2 AA non-compliance, inaccessible to keyboard users
- **Fix**: Already included in `components.css` (focus-visible styles)
- **Priority**: P1 (WCAG compliance)

---
