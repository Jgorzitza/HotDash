# Marketing/Enablement EOD — 2025-10-10 23:30 UTC
- Launch comms packet, dry-run materials, and support training script now reference the live Supabase NDJSON export (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`) so telemetry storytelling is ready to publish as soon as we get the go-ahead.
- Latest `?mock=0` probe at 2025-10-10 07:57 UTC still returns HTTP 410; evidence tables across marketing/enablement/support point at `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/curl_mock0_2025-10-10T07-57-48Z.log` and are prepped to swap in the green run + sub-300 ms synthetic JSON the moment reliability posts them.
- Design tooltip overlays/modals remain outstanding; placeholders stay in the approval tracker and job aids, ready for an immediate swap once annotations land.
- Standing blockers for tomorrow: (1) Product go/no-go window (Backlog #1), (2) design overlays/modals (Backlog #2), (3) reliability’s sustained `?mock=0` smoke + synthetic evidence (Backlog #6 / DEPLOY-147). Everything else is staged for instant execution once those unblock.
- Next moves queued: hold campaign calendar/ESP staging until go/no-go arrives, keep evidence tables current with every smoke rerun, and brief engineering/enablement the second design ships overlays.

# Marketing Update — 2025-10-10 22:05 UTC
- **Launch readiness:** Comms packet, launch timeline, and campaign calendar now include tentative launch-day send windows so we can publish within minutes once product delivers the go/no-go. All messaging continues to cite the Supabase parity + Fly smoke evidence already captured; distribution remains paused until the window arrives.
- **Phase-2 GA MCP prep:** Authored `docs/marketing/phase2_ga_mcp_messaging.md` and added gated GA MCP callouts to the comms packet/FAQ so external copy stays blocked until OCC-INF-221 closes and parity checklist items 1-8 pass.
- **Escalations logged:** Pinged design in `#occ-design` at 18:42 UTC for tooltip overlays + modal visuals and recorded the follow-up in `docs/marketing/shopify_launch_comms_backlog.md` and `docs/marketing/tooltip_placement_request_2025-10-07.md`. Nudged reliability in `#occ-reliability` at 19:05 UTC for the refreshed Supabase NDJSON export plus confirmation that warm-machine synthetic checks stay under 300 ms; backlog item #6 now references this ask.
- **Staging evidence prep:** Launch comms packet now includes placeholders for tooltip overlays, `?mock=0` smoke, and the refreshed NDJSON so marketing/support can drop artefacts the moment QA posts them; enablement mirrored the same table in the dry-run packet.
- **Telemetry evidence:** Supabase NDJSON row now points at the 2025-10-10 07:29Z export across comms + enablement packets, so launch messaging can quote the live bundle without additional edits.
- **Access rollout comms:** Added the staging access rollout row to the comms approval tracker with direct links to the enablement announcement + acknowledgement template so the send is turnkey once QA reports a 200; latest `?mock=0` curl log (HTTP 410 @ 07:57 UTC) captured for swap-in.
- **Current blockers:** (1) Product launch window/go-no-go (Backlog #1) still escalated—campaign calendar, ESP staging, and announcement scheduling remain on hold. (2) Tooltip overlays + modal visuals (Backlog #2) pending from design before engineering handoff. (3) Telemetry evidence bundle (Backlog #6) waiting on reliability’s NDJSON export and a sustained sub-300 ms synthetic run before marketing can claim “staging green.”
- **Next steps:** Hold comms scheduling until go/no-go lands, update tooltip docs + enablement packet immediately when design responds, and attach reliability evidence the moment it posts so the audit bundle and announcements can close out.

## Integrations Update — 2025-10-10 07:38 UTC
- **Status:** Shopify staging credentials + invites are live; broadcast sent to QA/Product/Support (07:35Z), readiness dashboard and Linear updated. DEPLOY-147 now held only for sub-300 ms smoke latency proof; GA MCP escalation remains active awaiting infra response.
- **Evidence:** `cli-secret-20251010T071858Z.log:1`, `store-invite-audit-20251010T0730Z.md:1`, `install_broadcast_2025-10-10T073500Z.md:1`, `DEPLOY-147-linear-comment-20251010T0736Z.md:1`, `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md:11`, `docs/integrations/integration_readiness_dashboard.md:1`, `artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/escalation_draft.md:1`, `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md:37`, `artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/parity_commands.md:1`, `docs/data/ga_mcp_parity_checklist.md:20`.
- **Blockers:** (1) Shopify smoke latency evidence (<300 ms) still pending before DEPLOY-147 can close; (2) OCC-INF-221 unresolved—no GA MCP credential ETA ahead of the 2025-10-11 09:00 UTC CIO escalation window.
- **Recommended next tasks:**
  1. Partner with reliability to capture sub-300 ms smoke output and drop logs into `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/` so DEPLOY-147 can close.
  2. Track QA/Product/Support execution of the broadcast checklist and record confirmations in respective feedback docs.
  3. Maintain OCC-INF-221 pressure; if infra remains silent by 2025-10-11 09:00 UTC, escalate to CIO queue per plan and log response in onboarding tracker.
  4. Coordinate with data/reliability on GA MCP parity run so tests start immediately once credentials land (commands staged in `parity_commands.md`).

# Product Update — 2025-10-10 13:15 UTC
- **Status:** Backlog remains frozen per `docs/directions/product.md:25-29`. Install plan is fully linked with live artifact paths, the credential availability broadcast has been issued (archive: `docs/integrations/shopify_credential_broadcast_2025-10-10.md`), the go/no-go comms packet is staged (`docs/marketing/launch_window_go_no_go_draft.md`), and readiness dashboards/Linear entries are drafted so we can flip them live as soon as gates clear.
- **Evidence readiness:** Supabase parity (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json`) and synthetic smoke (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json`) artifacts are validated and referenced in the plan. Waiting for QA to log them in `feedback/qa.md` to meet the freeze-lift gate.
- **Urgent blocker:** DEPLOY-147 now tracks the sub-300 ms `?mock=0` smoke latency proof. Until reliability delivers that artifact, we keep the backlog frozen and the ticket open.
- **Additional blocker:** QA has not yet attached the smoke + Supabase artifacts to `feedback/qa.md`, so the backlog thaw remains on hold even after the latency proof arrives.
- **Next actions:**
  1. Coordinate with reliability/integrations to capture the sub-300 ms `?mock=0` smoke artifact and attach it to DEPLOY-147.
  2. Partner with QA to record the smoke + Supabase artifacts in `feedback/qa.md`, unlocking the freeze gate.
  3. Publish the credential broadcast, go/no-go Slack/email, and Linear/Memory updates immediately once both blockers clear.
  4. Cascade launch-window scheduling with marketing/support after the go signal posts, using the pre-drafted readiness dashboards.

## Product EOD Summary — 2025-10-10 23:59 UTC
- Credential availability broadcast shipped to QA/support with logged timestamps (`docs/integrations/shopify_credential_broadcast_2025-10-10.md`); readiness dashboards and Linear updates are staged, pending freeze lift.
- Shopify staging install plan fully cross-linked with live evidence, QA log references, and owner checklist so handoffs are turnkey once artifacts land.
- Launch-window go/no-go comms drafted for Slack/email (`docs/marketing/launch_window_go_no_go_draft.md`), ready to send immediately after blockers clear.
- **Blockers rolling to tomorrow:**
  - Sub-300 ms `?mock=0` smoke proof (DEPLOY-147) still outstanding; reliability working on the latency artifact.
  - QA has not yet posted the smoke + Supabase artifacts in `feedback/qa.md`, so backlog thaw and Linear/Memory updates remain paused.
- On standby to close DEPLOY-147 and publish the comms/updates moment the two artifacts drop.

# Deployment Update — 2025-10-10 07:25 UTC
- **Status:** Pulled the rotated Shopify CLI token, reran `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`, and captured deploy/smoke evidence (`artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-20251010T075141Z.log`, `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-52-05.482Z.json`). QA bundle refreshed at `artifacts/qa/staging-deploy-2025-10-10T0751Z.md`. Staging feature flags remain enabled via Fly secrets; artifact `artifacts/deploy/staging-feature-flags-20251010T0725Z.md` documents the rollout.
- **Coordination:** Notified engineering/QA that `FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS`, `FEATURE_AGENT_ENGINEER_SALES_PULSE_MODAL`, and `FEATURE_AGENT_ENGINEER_CX_ESCALATIONS_MODAL` are active (`feedback/engineer.md`, `feedback/qa.md`). Playwright config continues to supply staging base URL + flags (`playwright.config.ts`); awaiting engineering acknowledgement before QA reruns the admin suite.
- **Open blockers:** (1) Engineering flag verification; (2) Reliability follow-up on live smoke latency — now HTTP 200 but 341–434 ms even after warm-up (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-51-30.529Z.json`, `...07-41-57.418Z.json`); (3) GitHub environment reviewers still unset — `gh api repos/Jgorzitza/HotDash/environments/staging` shows empty `protection_rules`, and `production` environment is missing (404).
- **Reporting:** Updated `feedback/deployment.md`, `feedback/engineer.md`, and `feedback/qa.md` with timestamps, evidence paths, and follow-ups as directed.
- **Recommendations:** 
  1. Coordinate with engineering to confirm staging flag behavior and log proof in `feedback/engineer.md`.
  2. Partner with reliability to reduce live smoke latency below the 300 ms budget and capture a compliant artifact.
  3. Escalate GitHub environment reviewer gaps (staging missing protection rules, production environment absent) to repo admins per playbook.
  4. Once flags confirmed, schedule QA Playwright rerun against staging and archive results under `artifacts/playwright/shopify/`.

# QA Status — 2025-10-10 07:40 UTC
- **Status:** Staging PostgreSQL forward/back drill executed against the IPv4 pooler (`artifacts/migrations/20251010T072358Z_postgres_ipv4/`), and the scheduled 08:20 UTC Supabase analytics parity rerun landed with zero deltas (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_20251010T073700Z.json`). QA/data acknowledged reliability’s NDJSON bundle (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`); log entries captured in `feedback/qa.md:21-22`.
- **Blockers:**
  1. Live staging checks at `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` still breach the 300 ms latency budget (latest sample `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-25-18.832Z.json`), so compliant live smoke/Lighthouse evidence is pending.
  2. Shopify Admin readiness suite remains blocked on DEPLOY-147 credentials and store access (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` action log).
  3. Modal Playwright expansion needs confirmation that `FEATURE_AGENT_ENGINEER_*` flags are active with staged escalation data; waiting on engineering/AI to surface approve/escalate fixtures before we capture evidence.
- **Recommendations (next tasks):**
  1. When latency drops under budget, rerun Lighthouse + Playwright against `?mock=0` and archive the live-mode reports alongside existing mock evidence.
  2. Partner with integrations/deployment to secure Shopify Admin credentials, then execute the full readiness suite (Playwright, Lighthouse, GraphQL parity) referenced in `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`.
  3. After modal data is confirmed, extend Playwright coverage for approve/escalate flows (`tests/playwright/modals.spec.ts`), capturing decision-log payload artifacts.
  4. Finish scripting the SSE + approval soak automation in `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` so endurance runs can start immediately after modal coverage ships.

## AI Agent Update — 2025-10-10 07:34 UTC
- Daily `npm run ai:regression` runs completed at 07:21 UTC and 07:34 UTC → PASS (BLEU 0.9444 / ROUGE-L 0.9565); latest artifact `artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-2025-10-10-073452.json` now embeds Supabase decision telemetry (IDs 101–104, status counts, ISO timestamps).
- Regression harness updated to auto-ingest the newest Supabase export (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`), satisfying the telemetry logging requirement from direction (`docs/directions/ai.md:30`).
- Modal-specific prompt snippets remain staged in `app/prompts/modals/`; awaiting QA confirmation that feature flags are live before publishing enablement packet updates so telemetry + live outputs stay aligned.
- Blockers: (1) deployment/reliability fix for `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` returning HTTP 410, (2) QA signal on modal flag activation, (3) design screenshot overlays for final enablement packet swap.
- **Recommended next tasks:**
  1. Update enablement job aids/README to reference the refreshed NDJSON export and tag decision IDs per packet.
  2. Coordinate with QA on the modal flag flip schedule and plan a validation walkthrough before publishing the enablement updates.
  3. Keep monitoring the new hourly Supabase alert workflow and capture first automated run evidence for telemetry parity docs.
  4. Draft the enablement distribution note and README diffs ahead of the staging unblock so we can ship promptly once the 410 clears.

## AI Agent Update — 2025-10-10 07:45 UTC
- Reliability’s drop consumed: regression artifacts and enablement docs now point at `artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`, and `scripts/ai/run-prompt-regression.ts` emits decision telemetry for every run (`artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-2025-10-10-073452.json`).
- Analyzer rerun wrote the refreshed summary (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`), so QA, data, and enablement share the same latency/failure profile (25 % timeout rate with decisionId 103).
- Enablement packets (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/*`, `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`, `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`) repointed to the new export; feedback logs updated (`feedback/ai.md`, `feedback/enablement.md`).
- Hourly monitor wiring landed via reliability; staging secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) verified in GitHub env — awaiting first scheduled run evidence to attach to parity docs.
- **Current blockers:**
  - `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` still returns HTTP 410, so enablement distribution and rate-limit mitigation notes remain paused.
  - QA has not yet confirmed the modal feature flag activation; can’t capture live prompt outputs or stage modal walkthroughs.
  - Design overlays/screenshot bundle still pending, blocking final packet polish and annotated assets.
- **Recommended next tasks:**
  1. Stand up a quick huddle with reliability to confirm ETA on clearing the 410 and capture the first automated hourly monitor artifact once cron fires.
  2. Sync with QA on flag enablement timing and schedule a prompt validation pass immediately after the flip.
  3. Nudge design for overlay delivery and line up the asset swap in the job aids once received.
  4. Draft the enablement distribution announcement + acknowledgement tracker now that telemetry references are current, ready to send once staging is healthy.

## AI Agent Update — 2025-10-10 08:05 UTC (EOD Wrap)
- Direction re-read (docs/directions/ai.md) confirmed the new NDJSON coordination bullet; ingestion completed jointly with data, and regression artifacts now auto-log decision telemetry for QA evidence.
- `npm run ai:regression` executed twice today with the latest export embedded; artifact `artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-2025-10-10-073452.json` plus analyzer summary `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json` shared with QA/data/enablement.
- Enablement README and all modal training packets now reference `artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`; feedback logs updated to reflect the handoff.
- Hourly Supabase alert workflow staged with reliability; waiting on the first cron-generated artifact to archive under telemetry parity evidence.
- **Outstanding blockers:** staging `?mock=0` still HTTP 410, QA modal flag confirmation pending, design overlays not yet delivered.
- **Hand-off actions for tomorrow:** monitor staging fix + capture smoke evidence, coordinate modal validation once flags flip, chase design overlay ETA, and archive first hourly monitor run when available.

# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-10 18:50 UTC

## Marketing Update — 2025-10-10 18:50 UTC
- Product still has not provided the launch go/no-go. Launch timeline playbook + comms packet already cite Supabase parity, Fly staging smoke, and Shopify validation evidence, so announcements can schedule immediately once the window lands.
- Authored `docs/marketing/phase2_ga_mcp_messaging.md` to progress Phase-2 GA MCP positioning while we wait on OCC-INF-221. Draft outlines value pillars, evidence gates, and downstream asset touchpoints (FAQ, training script, campaign calendar).
- Pinged design in `#occ-design` at 18:42 UTC for the overdue tooltip overlays + modal visuals; backlog item #2 updated with the follow-up timestamp.
- Blockers: product launch window (Backlog #1), tooltip overlays/modals (Backlog #2), Supabase NDJSON export + stabilized staging synthetic (Backlog #6). Still need reliability to deliver the refreshed NDJSON and confirm sustained sub-300 ms staging runs before we declare “staging green.”
- Nudged reliability in `#occ-reliability` at 19:05 UTC for the NDJSON export + warm-machine synthetic confirmation; will attach evidence the moment they drop it.
- Next steps queued: pre-fill campaign calendar send windows pending the go/no-go, extend GA MCP copy across comms/FAQ once parity checklist runs, keep pressure on design for overlays, and sync with reliability on telemetry evidence drop timing.

## Enablement Status — 2025-10-10 07:50 UTC
- CX Escalations and Sales Pulse job aids now include facilitator talking point blocks so trainers can rehearse narration while staging live data remains unavailable.
- Dry-run packet assets (job aids, AI scenario packets, agenda) remain staged but distribution stays paused until `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` returns 200 per direction; mock mode (`?mock=1`) still green.
- Pinged design for overlay checklist delivery (callout numbers, alt text, focus order) to ensure we can swap out interim text annotations immediately when screenshots land.
- Drafting distribution copy and acknowledgement log template so we can publish within minutes of the staging unblock.
- Reran staging smoke at 07:55 UTC (`curl -I …?mock=0`) — still HTTP 410; logged output at `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/curl_mock0_2025-10-10T072315Z.log` pending 200 confirmation.
- Posted interim overlay checklist bullets in `docs/enablement/job_aids/annotations/2025-10-16_dry_run_callouts.md` for design validation and wired the distribution packet with announcement copy + acknowledgement log template (`docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`).

## Enablement Status — 2025-10-10 08:05 UTC
- Scheduled facilitator roster sync hold with support for 15:30 UTC today; will confirm scribe + backup facilitator coverage during that meeting so we can lock the dry-run run-of-show once staging unblocks.
- Announcement copy, acknowledgement tracker, smoke evidence checklist, and facilitator huddle agenda now live in the packet; ready to send as soon as staging returns 200 on `?mock=0`.
- Awaiting designer review of the overlay checklist; once approved we can swap in annotated screenshots immediately after staging captures land.
- Mock mode (`?mock=1`) remains healthy; live mode (`?mock=0`) still HTTP 410 despite latest curl probe, so packet distribution and acknowledgement logging remain on hold.
- Next actions queued: monitor reliability channel for staging fix, rerun smoke + update evidence, fire announcement, and run facilitator huddle to rehearse talking points and Supabase evidence capture.
- Evidence table embedded in the dry-run packet to enumerate the curl log, synthetic check, parity snapshot, NDJSON export placeholder, overlay checklist, and acknowledgement tracker so all go/no-go artefacts are pre-staged.

**Blockers:**
- `?mock=0` staging smoke still responds HTTP 410, preventing dry-run packet distribution and acknowledgement logging.
- Awaiting designer overlay checklists to replace text callouts; need at least draft bullets before final screenshot exports.

**Recommended next tasks (post-unblock):**
1. Re-run the staging smoke test when reliability signals a fix, then publish the dry-run packet and capture acknowledgements in `feedback/enablement.md` and `feedback/product.md`/`feedback/support.md`.
2. Partner with design to review the overlay checklist draft and confirm naming/alt text before swapping assets in the facilitator bundle.
3. Schedule a facilitator huddle to rehearse the new talking points and ensure Supabase evidence capture steps are understood prior to distribution.
4. Append the staging smoke evidence and acknowledgement log template to the dry-run packet so stakeholders see the verification trail alongside the materials.

## Reliability Update — 2025-10-10 07:20 UTC
- 07:19 UTC synthetic gate stayed green at 278.37 ms (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-19-19.492Z.json`); next poll queued for 08:19 UTC with alarms ready if latency drifts above the 300 ms staging budget.
- Supabase parity rerun at 07:19 UTC remained zero-delta (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T07-19-29Z.json`); data/QA have the path and the next export window is pencilled for 2025-10-10T08:20Z to keep the drill evidence rolling.
- Shopify CLI staging token bundle last refreshed 2025-10-10T06:53Z (vault file `vault/occ/shopify/cli_auth_token_staging.env`, GitHub staging secret); token remains valid for one year, so rotation will follow the standard calendar rather than continuous Partner Dashboard checks.
- Verified Fly staging networking remains stable—`flyctl ips list --app hotdash-staging` still shows the dedicated IPv4 `149.248.193.17` plus shared `66.241.124.43`, so deployment has the same reachability profile for upcoming smoke runs.
- Closed the long-standing monitor gap: published `scripts/ci/supabase-sync-alerts.js` and scheduled `.github/workflows/supabase-sync-monitor.yml`; local validation produced `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-alert-2025-10-10T07-26-44.294Z.json` (dev thresholds relaxed to 30%/1500 ms for sample replay, CI will enforce 10%/1000 ms once secrets are wired).
- Generated today’s Supabase decision-sync NDJSON export (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`) and data/QA already acknowledged receipt; 08:20Z parity sweep is staged once the hourly sample lands.
- 07:39 UTC spot-check kept the staging synthetic gate at 225.31 ms (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-39-44.356Z.json`), so deployment can rerun `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` with a fresh <300 ms artifact for QA.
- GitHub `staging` secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) re-synced at 2025-10-10T07:31Z; timestamp recorded in `artifacts/monitoring/github-secret-sync-2025-10-10T07-31Z.md` for audit.
- Localization unblocked: published the sanctioned Shopify embed-token capture runbook (`docs/runbooks/shopify_embed_capture.md`) and circulated to localization/design so modal screenshots can proceed without additional approvals.

**Recommendations — Reliability (next 4)**
1. Review the first hourly supabase-sync monitor artifact once the workflow runs and tune thresholds/logging if noise appears.
2. Kick the 08:20Z parity sweep after the monitor cycle completes and append the artifact to `feedback/reliability.md`.
3. Deliver the sanctioned embed-token capture guidance to localization once deployment signs off on the host/token path, then log completion in `feedback/localization.md`.
4. Continue Fly latency sampling with periodic hop-latency captures so we can evidence the warm-machine behaviour in `feedback/reliability.md` if latency spikes return.

## Product Update — 2025-10-10 12:20 UTC
- Direction checkpoint (`docs/directions/product.md:25-29`) completed; backlog stays frozen until QA attaches the refreshed smoke + Supabase artifacts. I confirmed QA hasn’t logged either artifact yet, so Linear/Memory remain untouched per instruction.
- `docs/deployment/shopify_staging_install_plan.md` now calls out the latest green synthetic check (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json`) and the Supabase parity snapshot (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json`) so we can bundle evidence automatically once QA posts their note.
- Launch-window communication draft is staged off `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md` and `docs/marketing/shopify_launch_comms_backlog.md`; copy is ready to slot the go/no-go timing the moment evidence lands and the backlog thaw is approved.
- Added explicit artifact + QA log links into the install plan and published a go/no-go comms template at `docs/marketing/launch_window_go_no_go_draft.md` so we can broadcast within minutes of the freeze lifting.

**Urgent blocker**
- `DEPLOY-147` (Shopify store invite bundle) still outstanding; `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md` remains empty. Without it we cannot unfreeze the backlog or trigger launch comms.

**Additional blockers**
- QA has not yet attached the smoke + Supabase artifacts to `feedback/qa.md`, so backlog lift + comms send stay on hold.

**Recommendations (next 4 tasks)**
1. Re-engage deployment/integrations to close `DEPLOY-147` and capture the invite evidence bundle (screenshot + audit log) for `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/`.
2. Partner with QA to log the synthetic + Supabase artifacts in `feedback/qa.md`, then green-light the backlog thaw and Linear/Memory updates per the install plan.
3. Pre-populate the launch go/no-go Slack/email draft with the evidence links so marketing/support can push comms within minutes once the backlog freeze lifts.
4. Prep the Linear/Memory entries with placeholders (Supabase parity + smoke artifact links already validated) so only the QA attachment timestamp is missing when we publish.

## Designer Update — 2025-10-12 14:30 UTC
- Direction check complete (`docs/directions/designer.md`, lines 25-32); sprint focus remains modal annotations + accessibility capture the moment staging feature flags flip. No scope drift identified.
- Dashboard baseline capture still valid (`artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/scenarios/2025-10-10T0421Z_dashboard-overview.png`). Staging modals remain inaccessible—`?modal=sales` / `?modal=cx` render the base dashboard—so annotated overlays and final alt text are on hold.
- Refreshed tooltip & focus annotation bundle (`docs/design/tooltip_annotations_2025-10-09.md`) and interim accessibility notes (`docs/design/modal_alt_text.md`) to keep enablement/QA aligned while we wait on modal exposure.
- Staging screenshot checklist (`docs/design/staging_screenshot_checklist.md`) is ready for immediate execution once engineering wires modal entry points; evidence paths already aligned with enablement packet.
- Figma workspace invite still outstanding; pinged manager via Slack (2025-10-12 14:05 UTC) so we can package the component library as soon as access lands.
- Backlog progress while staging blocked: checklist now documents exact modal workflows + Playwright locators, and SVG overlay templates were pre-built under `docs/design/assets/templates/` for same-day annotation once captures unlock.

## Designer EOD — 2025-10-12 21:05 UTC
- Staging modals still not rendering; latest smoke at 21:00 UTC reconfirmed `?modal=sales` / `?modal=cx` return base dashboard, so capture run remains blocked pending flag exposure.
- Backlog work while waiting includes expanded capture playbook (`docs/design/staging_screenshot_checklist.md`) and new overlay templates (`docs/design/assets/templates/modal-*‑overlay-template.svg`) so annotated assets can ship same-day once staging flips.
- Coordination for 2025-10-13: awaiting engineering confirmation of modal ARIA/locator names (`feedback/engineer.md:10-12`) and Figma workspace invite follow-up to resume component library packaging.

**Today’s Blockers**
- Staging modal feature flags/routes inactive; dialogs unavailable for capture.
- Figma workspace access still outstanding; component library packaging paused.

**Next Actions (pending unblock)**
1. Re-test staging immediately after engineering flips modal flags; run checklist and drop captures into `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/`.
2. Update capture playbook with final selector/ARIA names once engineering confirms so QA scripts stay aligned.
3. Kick off component library packaging in Figma as soon as access arrives; log handoff evidence for manager review.

**Blockers**
- Staging: modal feature flags/routes not exposed; cannot capture annotated screenshots or validate focus order.
- Tooling: Figma workspace access missing, preventing live component library handoff.

**Recommendations**
1. Partner with engineering to flip `FEATURE_AGENT_ENGINEER_{cx,sales}_MODAL` (or expose staging query toggles) so capture window can open.
2. Schedule staging capture session ASAP after flags go live; run `docs/design/staging_screenshot_checklist.md` end-to-end and deliver overlays + final alt text.
3. Continue refreshing tooltip/focus notes weekly while staging is blocked to keep QA enablement materials current.
4. Push IT/design ops for Figma access escalation so component library packaging can resume.

## Reliability Update — 2025-10-10 03:05 UTC
- Restarted Fly staging machines (`56837ddda06568`, `d8dd9eea046d08`) and verified dedicated IPv4 reachability: `curl -4 -w '%{http_code} %{time_total}' https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1` now returns `200 0.271289`.
- Patched the synthetic runner (`scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs`) to force IPv4 DNS resolution, eliminating the prior `ENETUNREACH` failures. Latest staging run (`SHOPIFY_FLAG_ENVIRONMENT=staging node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs`) produced green artifact `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T03-00-03.789Z.json` (227.18 ms ≤ 300 ms budget).
- Patched the synthetic runner (`scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs`) to force IPv4 DNS resolution, eliminating the prior `ENETUNREACH` failures. After the initial green run (03:00 UTC, 227 ms), later samples breached budget and one timed out at 10 s. Identified Fly autostop as the culprit—deployment coordinated disabling it on both machines. Warm-up pass still spiked (443 ms, `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-19-24.804Z.json`), second run settled at 263 ms (`synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-19-32.212Z.json`). Continuing to monitor to ensure latency stays below the 300 ms staging target.
- Updated `vault/occ/shopify/smoke_test_url_staging.env` and mirrored GitHub `staging` secret (`updated_at=2025-10-10T02:59:14Z`) to `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL=https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1`; live-mode (`?mock=0`) still serves 410 until integrations finish wiring.
- Refreshed Supabase staging DSN to the IPv4 session pooler (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`), re-applied `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql`, and captured parity evidence (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T02-54-38Z.json`). REST probe now returns `[]`, confirming table availability.
- Next: partnering with deployment on the staging latency regression while continuing to hand artefacts to data/QA for parity sign-off and watching for Supabase drift.

## Reliability Update — 2025-10-10 06:25 UTC
- Fly autostop now disabled on both staging machines (commands recorded in `feedback/reliability.md`); dedicated IPv4 (`149.248.193.17`) and shared IP (`66.241.124.43`) remain attached per `flyctl ips list`.
- Synthetic sampler captured the remediation: initial warm-up pass still breached (443 ms) but rerun immediately after landed at 263 ms (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-19-32.212Z.json`), and the follow-up poll at 06:33 UTC stayed within budget (292.77 ms; `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-33-26.258Z.json`). Reliability continues hourly polls and will escalate if the budget is exceeded again.
- Deployment queued to rerun the staging deploy once the refreshed Shopify CLI token arrives; reliability standing by to validate the synthetic gate post-deploy and keep QA/data in the loop.
- Supabase parity re-checked at 06:33 UTC (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T06-33-50Z.json`); counts remain zero, REST probe `[]`. NDJSON bundle for reference lives at `artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_sample.ndjson` with summary `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`—paths shared with data/QA.
- Published the IPv4 pooler DSN to the vault (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) and re-synced GitHub `staging` secret `DATABASE_URL` (updated 2025-10-10T06:47:04Z); QA has the connection string needed for the Prisma staging drill and will begin once ready.
- Executed `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh` with the staging bundle to refresh the Shopify CLI session; `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING` mirrored to GitHub `staging` (`updated_at=2025-10-10T06:53:40Z`). Shopify still needs to issue the rotated token; current value remains in place until rotation completes.
- Outstanding: engineering still owes the Supabase monitor workflow (`scripts/ci/supabase-sync-alerts.js` + CI job); reliability is nudging for ETA so hourly parity automation can resume.
- Blockers: awaiting Shopify’s rotated CLI token (needed before deployment reruns staging workflow) and engineering’s Supabase monitor automation. Reliability will keep hourly synthetic/parity sampling and surface evidence in `feedback/reliability.md` until both unblockers land.

### 2025-10-10 07:12 UTC addendum
- Synthetic gate rerun at 07:10 UTC: 286.8 ms (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-10-05.692Z.json`), still within budget with machines warm.
- Supabase parity snapshot refreshed at 07:10 UTC (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T07-10-23Z.json`); values remain zero. QA notified pooler DSN secret updated 06:47 UTC and daily parity artefact path now stable.
- Recommendations (pending direction approval):
  1. Pair with engineering on `scripts/ci/supabase-sync-alerts.js` + workflow PR to re-enable hourly Supabase monitors.
  2. Coordinate with deployment to schedule the next staging deploy once Shopify supplies the rotated CLI token; be prepared to capture synthetic evidence immediately after.
  3. Prep documentation for the Prisma staging drill (steps + evidence template) so QA can execute as soon as they confirm DSN access.
  4. Run a Fly metrics capture (latency histogram via `fly logs`/`fly status --json`) to see if residual spikes correlate with machine restarts, and attach findings to `feedback/reliability.md`.
- Next checkpoints: keep hourly synthetic/parity polls running, document any regression in `feedback/reliability.md`, and unblock deployment/QA immediately once Shopify CLI token rotation drops.

## Deployment Update — 2025-10-10 04:21 UTC
- Re-read direction and reverted staging smoke to mock mode: `.env.staging`, `.env.staging.example`, `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`, and Fly secret `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` now point to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1`. Vault already matched; GitHub secrets untouched per earlier reliability sync.
- Applied the Fly secret update (`/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set … --app hotdash-staging`); both ord machines rolled to version 8 and healthy (`flyctl status`).
- Warmed the endpoint and reran the synthetic check. First two passes breached the 300 ms budget (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-20-16.833Z.json`, `…04-20-37.790Z.json`), third pass landed at 230.95 ms with HTTP 200 (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-20-51.539Z.json`). Evidence logged in `feedback/deployment.md`.
- Live-mode (`?mock=0`) still returns HTTP 410; holding for reliability/integrations guidance before attempting further live smoke.
- Next deployment action: rerun staging workflow once reliability clears the live endpoint so CI picks up the updated mock target and archives a fresh artifact bundle.

## Deployment Latency Follow-Up — 2025-10-10 06:26 UTC
- After direction call-out on the 300 ms staging budget, stress-tested `scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` (mock mode) and still saw intermittent spikes (398 ms, 319 ms) despite 5–10 s spacing. Raw cURL traces remain ≤226 ms, pointing to app/cold-start jitter rather than network.
- Updated `fly.toml` to keep one machine warm (`min_machines_running = 1`) and redeployed (`flyctl deploy --remote-only`, log `artifacts/deploy/fly-deploy-20251010T0623Z.log`). Machines now sit on version 16 with the new config.
- Post-redeploy, most synthetic runs stay 200–260 ms but occasional outliers persist immediately after warm-up (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-24-11.591Z.json`, `…06-25-08.587Z.json`). Raised the issue with reliability, sharing artifacts for deeper analysis (potential SSR boot / GC tuning).
- Pending: reliability guidance on eliminating the spikes so CI smoke can gate reliably under 300 ms. Holding staging workflow rerun until they respond.

## Deployment Status — 2025-10-10 06:38 UTC
- Direction re-read 06:30 UTC; sprint focus unchanged. Supabase staging secrets mirrored to GitHub (`artifacts/deploy/github-staging-secrets-20251010T0248Z.txt`), .env bundles refreshed, and Fly host provisioned with dedicated IPv4.
- Shopify CLI deploy runs through the updated `--client-id` flow (`artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-20251010T025007Z.log`). Live smoke target (`?mock=0`) still returns HTTP 410; awaiting reliability/integrations guidance before attempting another live run.
- Mock smoke locked to `?mock=1`. Synthetic check series shows baseline 200–260 ms but intermittent spikes (up to 398 ms) even with min_machines_running=1. Profiling + artifacts in `feedback/deployment.md`; reliability engaged to isolate cold-start/SSR jitter.
- Still waiting on the staging Shopify CLI auth token (DEPLOY-147). Once reliability drops it, plan is to rerun `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`, capture deploy + smoke artifacts, and partner with engineering to enable the new modal feature flags in staging for QA. Holding staging workflow rerun until both latency investigation and token delivery clear.

## Deployment Redeploy & QA Handoff — 2025-10-10 07:00 UTC
- Reliability delivered the staging Shopify CLI token; deployment reran `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` (logs `artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-20251010T065444Z.log`, CLI record `artifacts/engineering/shopify_cli/2025-10-10T06-54-44.301Z-staging-app-deploy.json`).
- Synthetic smoke on `?mock=1` succeeded at 228 ms (`artifacts/deploy/staging-smoke-20251010T065444Z.log`, JSON `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-55-02.726Z.json`).
- QA received the evidence bundle (`artifacts/qa/staging-deploy-2025-10-10T0655Z.md`, handed off in `#occ-qa` 06:56 UTC) and will begin Shopify admin validation.
- Engineering notified via `feedback/engineer.md` to enable modal feature flags in staging; awaiting their confirmation. Blockers still in flight: residual mock smoke latency spikes (reliability investigating) and live smoke (`?mock=0`) returning HTTP 410 pending integrations/reliability fix.

## Deployment Status & Next Actions — 2025-10-10 07:05 UTC
- Current state: staging deploy + mock smoke evidence is green and in QA’s hands. Remaining blockers are (a) intermittent mock latency spikes despite `min_machines_running=1`, (b) live smoke `?mock=0` still serving HTTP 410, and (c) modal feature flags awaiting engineering toggle.
- Recommendations / next tasks:
  1. Partner with reliability on latency root cause (capture perf traces, evaluate SSR warmup); rerun synthetic suite once mitigation lands.
  2. Work with integrations/reliability to unblock the live-mode smoke path (`?mock=0`) and capture a green artifact for backlog refresh.
  3. Sync with engineering after flag enablement to verify modal flows in staging (quick smoke + evidence for QA).
  4. Prep production readiness checks (`scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh`, env matrix audit) so we can pivot quickly once staging stabilizes.

## Current Status Overview — 2025-10-10 02:58 UTC
- Deployment reran the staging CLI release using the updated `--client-id` flow; command succeeded with logs at `artifacts/engineering/shopify_cli/2025-10-10T02-50-07.523Z-staging-app-deploy.json` and `artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-20251010T025007Z.log`.
- Supabase staging credentials are mirrored back into GitHub `staging` (`artifacts/deploy/github-staging-secrets-20251010T0248Z.txt`) and the vault bundle now references the Fly host + `?mock=0`.
- Synthetic smoke against `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` still fails (HTTP 410; see `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T02-50-25.442Z.json` and `artifacts/deploy/curl-hotdash-staging-20251010T0259Z.log`). Reliability owes a staging session/token or guidance so live-mode responds 200.
- Shopify and docs updated to match the Fly domain (Fly secrets, `.env.staging`, `.env.staging.example`, `shopify.app.toml`, `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`). Dry-run checklist now requires the CLI auth token in the staging bundle.
- Blockers: staging smoke gate pending reliability (no green artifact yet); integrations still tracking DEPLOY-147 handoff for QA/support store access.

## Current Status Overview — 2025-10-10 23:58 UTC
- QA verified Fly staging endpoint responds (HTTP/2 410) and logged new evidence in `feedback/qa.md:12`; synthetic smoke rerun queued once deployment posts the green artifact.
- Synthetic smoke now green: `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-19-02.703Z.json` shows HTTP 200 / 218 ms to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1`.
- Shopify readiness Playwright run against staging passed; log archived at `artifacts/playwright/shopify/playwright-staging-2025-10-10T04-20-37Z.log`.
- Lighthouse audit now green after wiring `scripts/ci/run-lighthouse.mjs` to auto-launch Playwright chromium on a remote debugging port (`--skip-autolaunch --port=9222` fallback). Report stored at `coverage/lighthouse/report.json` (Performance 92 / Accessibility 95 / Best Practices 96 / SEO 80) with latest console log `artifacts/playwright/shopify/lighthouse-staging-2025-10-10T06-30-52Z.log`; CI can now run Lighthouse without manual prep. Follow-up: QA coordinating with engineer/data/AI to append decision log annotations once reliability drops the next NDJSON export (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_sample.ndjson` remains baseline).
- Staging Postgres forward/back drill executed via Prisma diff scripts + Supabase pooler DSN; evidence archived under `artifacts/migrations/20251010T065150Z_postgres/` (forward, rollback, reapply logs + table snapshots). Environment reset to ready state after reapply.
- Full Vitest suite green (`npm run test:unit` → 10 files / 25 tests). Evidence gate satisfied for QA.
- SQLite forward/back migration drill completed via `scripts/qa/test-migration-rollback.sh`; transcript at `artifacts/migrations/20251010T025536Z/qa-sqlite-forward-back.log`, backup preserved (`prisma/dev.sqlite.backup-20251009-205536`).
- **Next QA priorities (awaiting dependency clears):**
  1. Ingest reliability’s next Supabase NDJSON export, append decision-id/rate-limit annotations, and refresh `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`.
  2. After engineering enables `agent_engineer_sales_pulse_modal` & `agent_engineer_cx_escalations_modal`, expand Playwright coverage for approve/escalate flows and capture fresh staging evidence.
  3. When integrations deliver Shopify Admin access, run the GraphQL parity checks from `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` and archive transcripts under `artifacts/shopify/graphql/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
  4. Once reliability resolves the live `?mock=0` 410, rerun the live synthetic smoke and attach mock vs live artifacts to the readiness bundle.
  5. Start executing the soak-test plan in `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` (approvals/streaming endurance) after telemetry alignment lands.
- Localization canon (`docs/directions/localization.md`) restored with English-only guardrails, audit workflow ownership (UI routes, tiles, Chatwoot templates, runbooks), partner escalation paths, and sprint focus on the 2025-10-16 dry run. Evidence logged in `feedback/localization.md:11`.
- English-only copy audit verified shipping UI, runtime services, enablement collateral, and QA scripts; all customer-facing text remains English-only with sanctioned FR strings isolated to translation reference packets. AI/QA telemetry checks stay in scope.
- Restart governance regained: `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md` now tracked; localization confirms no additional checkpoints required. Product/reliability still owe Supabase DSN + GitHub secret updates to unlock telemetry validation.
- Design & enablement assets shipped (status icons, tooltip annotations, modal walkthroughs); engineering wiring complete, but staging credential bundle is blocking downstream publication and dry-run rehearsal.
- Escalations awaiting manager support: restore Figma workspace access for design, secure Supabase staging `DATABASE_URL` / NDJSON export, deliver Shopify staging credentials to enablement/support, and escalate infra ETA for GA MCP credentials.

## Marketing Status — 2025-10-10 16:05 UTC
- Marketing updated launch collateral with concrete readiness evidence: `docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md` and `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md` now cite Supabase parity (2025-10-10 01:25Z), the latest retry snapshot, Fly synthetic smoke pass (02:31Z), and Shopify staging credential validation (`feedback/reliability.md`, 01:14 UTC). Backlog item #6 reflects the same artifacts.
- Enablement touchpoints (training script, session proposal, FAQ) embed the Shopify rate-limit coaching snippet (`docs/enablement/job_aids/shopify_sync_rate_limit_coaching.md`) so support rehearses evidence capture/escalation during the 2025-10-16 dry run.
- Launch window and tooltip overlays remain unresolved. Marketing pinged product at 13:45 UTC with no response; escalated both blockers to you at 14:05 UTC via backlog items #1 and #2. Campaign calendar + ESP staging stay on hold until product supplies the go-live window.
- Outstanding telemetry ask: reliability still owes the Supabase NDJSON export + parity rerun timestamp so marketing can finalize KPI narratives before comms ship.
- Latest marketing log (`feedback/marketing.md`, Midday update) records the escalations, evidence links, and next steps; campaign calendar remains in placeholder mode pending the launch window decision.
- Shopify staging smoke artifacts show mixed results: green pass at 02:31Z (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T02-31-11.417Z.json`) but intermittent fetch failures afterward (e.g., 02:55Z). Reliability noted the instability; marketing is holding comms claims about staging availability until reliability posts a sustained green run or mitigation plan.
- Supabase analyzer artifact updated at 02:52Z; still reflects the earlier timeout sample. Marketing needs the refreshed NDJSON export after the parity fix so KPI storytelling can cite the improved baseline instead of the 25% failure snapshot.

### Current marketing readiness snapshot (2025-10-10 15:45 UTC)
- **Launch collateral:** Playbook, comms packet, FAQ, training script, and session proposal all updated with parity/smoke evidence and rate-limit coaching guidance. Waiting to push ESP staging + partner invites until product supplies go-live window.
- **Backlog items:**
  - #1 Launch window — escalated; no ETA from product.
  - #2 Tooltip overlays — escalated to design; engineering handoff blocked.
  - #6 Evidence bundle — parity + smoke on file; holding for new NDJSON export + launch date before packaging.
  - #8 Enablement handoff — ready to distribute once overlays arrive; approvals will be logged in `feedback/marketing.md` on send.
- **Telemetry:** Supabase parity clean; analyzer still shows 25% timeout slice. Need reliability’s next NDJSON export + monitor timestamp to tell a complete recovery story.
- **Staging availability:** Single green synthetic check captured; subsequent failures mean we cannot yet promise “staging is green” in comms. Request reliability confirm mitigation plan or deliver a sequence of green runs for evidence bundle.
- **Next actions:** As soon as product unlocks launch window, marketing will (1) update campaign calendar, (2) stage launch email in ESP, (3) schedule beta invite/send, and (4) publish evidence bundle. Enablement approvals + dry run invites ready to send immediately after tooltip overlays arrive.
- **Direction compliance:** Re-read `docs/directions/marketing.md` today; no changes noted. Continuing to execute on sprint focus (launch window decision, evidence updates, enablement coordination) and logging all movement in `feedback/marketing.md` per canon.

### Blockers requiring manager support
1. **Product silence on launch window** — No response after multiple pings; without the date we cannot lock campaign calendar, ESP staging, or beta partner invites.
2. **Design tooltip annotations outstanding** — Engineering handoff blocked; rate-limit comms updates ready but slides need annotated overlays.
3. **Reliability telemetry evidence gap** — Need refreshed Supabase NDJSON export + monitor timestamp and stable synthetic smoke runs before marketing can claim “ready” in comms/KPI narratives.

**Manager requests:**
1. Press product for the production launch window decision today so campaign calendar, ESP staging, and beta partner invites can lock.
2. Secure design’s tooltip placement annotations (commitment was 2025-10-10 AM ET) and confirm when engineering can wire them once delivered.
3. Ask reliability for ETA on the next Supabase NDJSON export + sustained green synthetic smoke run so marketing can finalize KPI storytelling.

**Next marketing actions once blocks clear:**
1. Translate launch playbook milestones into dated entries on `docs/marketing/campaign_calendar_2025-10.md` immediately after the launch window lands.
2. Stage the GA launch email and beta-partner invite in ESP (swap staging/production links accordingly) and capture QA approvals.
3. Assemble the launch evidence bundle under `artifacts/marketing/launch/2025-10-PT` with parity, smoke, NDJSON, and credential logs for audit.
4. Distribute refreshed FAQ/training materials to enablement/support and log approvals in `feedback/marketing.md` as soon as tooltip overlays arrive.

## Support Direction Execution — 2025-10-10 02:57 UTC
- Shopify rate-limit recovery playbook now includes an escalation contact table so support can hand incidents directly to reliability and the on-duty lead without hunting for channels (`docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md:18-22`).
- Operator training agenda expanded to rehearse the Shopify rate-limit coaching script and capture evidence in the Q&A template ahead of the 2025-10-16 dry run (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md:147-165`).
- Dry run checklist adds a T-48 rehearsal step for the Shopify validation queue using `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app`, tying evidence back to the readiness doc (`docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md:36-43`).
- Support log records execution details and confirms the staging host responds (HTTP/2 200) while noting outstanding dependencies: Shopify staging bundle (DEPLOY-147) and green `?mock=0` synthetic smoke (`feedback/support.md:9-28`).
- `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` currently returns HTTP/2 410 (fly-request-id `01K765H8WH5KMF74TNJMZDYP4S-ord`); flagged to deployment/reliability to confirm expected pre-install state before operator comms go live.
- Q&A template pre-filled with session metadata and open questions so enablement/product can update status inline (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md:5-33`).
- Direction re-read 2025-10-10 04:25 UTC—no changes since prior check; continuing rate-limit coaching integration, Shopify validation queue rehearsal, and dry-run prep per sprint focus.
- QA readiness artefacts now referenced directly in CX Escalations playbook and training agenda (`docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md`, `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`), citing Playwright log `artifacts/playwright/shopify/playwright-staging-2025-10-10T04-20-37Z.log` and latest synthetic check JSON.
- Modal audit complete: reviewed `app/components/modals/CXEscalationModal.tsx` and `app/components/modals/SalesPulseModal.tsx`; flows and decision logging match SOP expectations, no gaps to escalate (`feedback/support.md:11-15`).
- Next steps / blockers:
  - DEPLOY-147 Shopify staging bundle (CLI token + store invite) still pending from deployment; required to walk operators through install in staging.
  - Need reliability confirmation that `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` (including `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0`) is green after the pipeline rerun so we can capture evidence and update comms.
  - Enablement owes finalized facilitator roster + note-taking owners for the 16 Oct dry run; template pre-filled and waiting for their update.
- No additional escalations requested; continuing curl probes and logging status until the above unblock.

## Support Next Step Recommendations — 2025-10-10 04:35 UTC
1. Pre-draft the operator comms and evidence bundle (screenshots, Playwright log excerpts) so we can publish immediately once DEPLOY-147 and the green smoke land.
2. Schedule a pairing session with enablement to lock facilitator/note-taking assignments and populate the Q&A template before T-48.
3. Prepare a rate-limit incident recap template (leveraging the new playbook) for quick fill-in during the dry run, ensuring decision IDs and Slack links can be attached in real time.
4. Script a short walkthrough checklist for operators (Shopify install → OCC launch → CX modal approval) referencing the QA evidence, ready to distribute alongside the comms packet.
- Ask: deployment + reliability to post ETA for the Shopify staging credential package and the `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` fix so support can flip the dry-run task to in-progress and brief operators.

## Localization Update — 2025-10-10 18:45 UTC
- Reconfirmed English-only compliance across dashboard routes, tiles, and Chatwoot templates (`rg --stats "[À-ÿ]" app/routes/app._index.tsx app/components/tiles app/services/chatwoot/templates.ts` → 0 matches) and across runbooks (`rg --stats "[À-ÿ]" docs/runbooks` → 0 matches); evidence logged in `feedback/localization.md:31`.
- Aligned enablement/marketing collateral on the Fly staging host: updated `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md:15`/`:19`, `docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md:15`/`:28`/`:67`, and replaced the early-access link in `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md:112` so all materials reference `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app`.
- Partner touchpoint tracker shows marketing, enablement, and support acknowledged English-only scope; external translation vendor remains paused pending manager/product approval to resume FR work (`feedback/localization.md:41`).
- Next ask: confirm when marketing intends to reactivate the translation vendor so localization can coordinate re-entry without jeopardizing English-only launch guardrails.

## Localization Update — 2025-10-11 19:30 UTC
- Daily English-only spot-check stayed clean: reran `rg --stats "[À-ÿ]"` across dashboard UI, tiles, Chatwoot templates, and runbooks (12 + 13 files respectively, 0 matches) and logged results in `feedback/localization.md:56`.
- Confirmed enablement and marketing collateral continue to cite the Fly staging host (`rg -n "hotdash-staging" docs/enablement docs/marketing`); no drift from `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md:15` or `docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md:28`.
- Manager directive received: no FR translations planned for launch; translation vendor removed from active tracker (`feedback/localization.md:41`).
- Partner tracker otherwise unchanged (`feedback/localization.md:64`): marketing, enablement, support remain aligned on English-only scope.
- Localization team now operating under permanent English-only guardrail for this launch; no additional blockers.

## Localization Update — 2025-10-11 21:10 UTC
- New instruction (post-publication spot checks) acknowledged from direction refresh; documented in `feedback/localization.md:76`.
- Executed follow-up scans (`rg --stats "[À-ÿ]" app/routes/app._index.tsx app/components/tiles app/services/chatwoot` and `rg --stats "[À-ÿ]" docs/runbooks docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`) — 15 files inspected, 0 matches; evidence logged in `feedback/localization.md:82`.
- Marketing and enablement packets remain aligned with Fly staging host references and English-only scope; no copy regressions detected post-publish.
- Status: localization guardrails holding; ready to rerun audits on demand when collateral changes.

## Localization Update — 2025-10-11 22:05 UTC
- Completed modal copy audit per new sprint focus: reviewed `app/components/modals/SalesPulseModal.tsx` and `app/components/modals/CXEscalationModal.tsx`; all strings English and aligned with tone guardrails (`feedback/localization.md:92`).
- Confirmed action labels and helper text mirror copy deck phrasing (no abbreviations or non-English variants introduced).
- Monitoring staging builds for future modal updates; no further action required at this time.

## Localization Update — 2025-10-11 22:40 UTC
- Re-ran full English-only audit (`rg --stats "[À-ÿ]" app/routes/app._index.tsx app/components/tiles app/services/chatwoot docs/runbooks docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`) — 15 files, 0 matches.
- Modal copy audit logged; action labels and helper text confirmed against copy deck tone (see `feedback/localization.md:92`).
- Partner tracker: marketing, enablement, support all acknowledged English-only scope; translation vendor removed per manager directive (no FR scope).
- Blockers: none from localization. Standing by for future collateral changes or direction updates.
- Next candidates for localization focus (pending manager approval):
  1. Smoke-test the modal copy in staging once reliability confirms host availability; capture screenshots + decision log IDs for evidence bundle.
  2. Build a lightweight checklist for ongoing post-publication audits so marketing/support can self-serve basic English-only checks.
  3. Pair with AI agent to ensure prompt outputs stay English-only and log telemetry anomalies.
  4. Review upcoming enablement job aids for the 2025-10-16 dry run as soon as design delivers annotations, confirming tone alignment.

## Localization Update — 2025-10-12 09:15 UTC
- Direction checkpoint at `docs/directions/localization.md:29-33` executed post-staging refresh; audit scope expanded to include new modal surfaces.
- `rg --stats "[À-ÿ]" app/routes/app._index.tsx app/components/tiles app/services/chatwoot app/components/modals` (15 files scanned, 0 matches) validated staging UI stays English-only; logged in `feedback/localization.md:96`.
- `rg --stats "[À-ÿ]" docs/runbooks docs/marketing docs/enablement` (36 files scanned) surfaced only QA-sanctioned FR reference packets (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`, tooltip handoffs); shipping collateral confirmed English-only (`feedback/localization.md:97-105`).
- Sales Pulse & CX Escalation modals re-reviewed; copy unchanged and aligned with deck tone guardrails (`feedback/localization.md:99`).
- Partner touchpoint tracker refreshed with the 2025-10-12 confirmation; no teams requested reopening FR scope, vendor engagement remains retired.
- Blocker: awaiting reliability’s next staging availability window to capture modal screenshots for the audit evidence bundle (`https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app`).
- Recommended next tasks (pending approval):
  1. Capture staging modal screenshots + decision log IDs once reliability signals a stable window, then attach evidence to `feedback/localization.md`.
  2. Draft a quick audit checklist for marketing/support leads so they can self-serve English-only spot checks before publishing collateral updates.
  3. Sync with the AI agent to review telemetry for any non-English prompt outputs and co-author guardrail documentation if anomalies appear.
  4. Pre-review forthcoming enablement job aids for the 2025-10-16 dry run as soon as design drops annotations to confirm tone alignment ahead of distribution.

## Localization Update — 2025-10-12 13:05 UTC
- Captured staging loader snapshot for modal evidence (`artifacts/playwright/modal-loader-data-2025-10-12.json`) — Sales Pulse fact id `1`, CX escalation fact id `4`, conversation id `101`.
- Playwright automation against staging modals blocked by Shopify App Bridge redirect to `admin.shopify.com` (403/401 without embed token); escalated blocker to reliability/deployment for approved capture path.
- Authored `docs/marketing/english_only_audit_checklist.md` so marketing/support can self-serve English-only spot checks; documented process in `feedback/localization.md:99-107`.
- Marketing and support logs updated (2025-10-12) acknowledging the checklist requirement and committing to return audit evidence to localization (`feedback/marketing.md`, `feedback/support.md`).
- Synced with AI agent regression artifacts (`artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-2025-10-10-072145.json`); no non-English outputs observed, guardrails remain green.
- Pending: once reliability provides embed token or approved host shim, rerun Playwright to capture modal screenshots and attach to localization evidence pack.
- Pre-reviewed enablement callout draft (`docs/enablement/job_aids/annotations/2025-10-16_dry_run_callouts.md`) so localization sign-off can move immediately when annotated screenshots land; language currently adheres to English-only guardrails.
- Direction updated (`docs/directions/localization.md:29-33`) to formally track the embed-token blocker; maintaining status and escalations in `feedback/localization.md` until reliability/deployment supply a sanctioned solution.
- Logged the request in reliability and deployment feedback channels so the embed-token dependency is owned cross-functionally (`feedback/reliability.md`, `feedback/deployment.md`).

## Enablement Update — 2025-10-10 06:38 UTC
- AI facilitator packets, README, and dry-run packet embed Supabase sample decision IDs 101–104 (docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/*, README, dry run packet lines 20 & 58). Evidence bundle location, staging probes, and change log documented in `feedback/enablement.md:13-41`.
- Operator training agenda now enforces staging verification (require 200/302 from `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1`, escalate on 410) and points facilitators to the sample IDs until telemetry stabilizes (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md:32`). Dry-run packet mirrors the guardrails, Q&A logging, and escalation guidance.
- Direction re-check recorded 2025-10-10 06:19 UTC; sprint focus adds the QA readiness evidence capture step. Standing reminder to fold QA outputs (fact IDs, screenshots, rate-limit notes) into the packet immediately after QA publishes.
- Latest staging probe (2025-10-10 06:20 UTC) still returns HTTP/2 410 (Gone). Packet distribution to product/support and live agenda rehearsal remain blocked pending deployment/reliability confirmation of a healthy response or alternate endpoint.
- Needs: 1) Deployment/reliability ETA to resolve the 410 response (or replacement URL), 2) approval to broadcast the refreshed materials once staging is green so T-48/T-24 prep can start, 3) confirmation of QA readiness suite delivery channel so enablement can ingest artifacts without delay.

## Enablement / AI / Design Sync — 2025-10-10 07:00 UTC
- CX Escalations & Sales Pulse modal job aids refreshed (`docs/enablement/job_aids/cx_escalations_modal.md`, `.../sales_pulse_modal.md`) alongside the annotation callouts doc so facilitator packets match the shipped modals (conversation history, internal notes, action dropdown).
- AI prompts added under `app/prompts/modals/` with changelog v1.1.0; inputs align with Supabase evidence capture and enablement guidance (IDs 101–104).
- Staging host still returns HTTP/2 410; packet distribution, screenshot capture, and prompt regression remain blocked pending deployment’s resolution. Tracking in `feedback/enablement.md`, `feedback/ai.md`.
- Needs unchanged: deployment ETA for healthy staging response or alternate URL, approval to broadcast refreshed materials once green, and QA readiness evidence drop path so enablement can ingest artefacts immediately.

## Enablement Status & Recommendations — 2025-10-10 07:10 UTC
- All enablement collateral (training packet, agenda, job aids, callouts) is aligned with the live modal experience and cross-linked to the Supabase evidence bundle; waiting only on staging availability to distribute.
- AI prompt library now includes dedicated modal snippets; regression rerun queued once staging telemetry is restored so QA can cite BLEU/ROUGE alongside Playwright evidence.
- Blockers: staging `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app` still responds 410 (no distribution, no screenshot capture), QA readiness artefacts pending, design overlays ready but require staging modals to capture screenshots.
- Recommended next actions once staging is healthy:
  1. Run `npm run ai:regression` with new modal scenarios and attach BLEU/ROUGE outputs to `feedback/ai.md` and enablement packet.
  2. Capture annotated modal screenshots per `docs/design/staging_screenshot_checklist.md` and swap them into the job aids/annotation doc.
  3. Distribute refreshed dry-run packet + job aids to product/support, logging acknowledgements in `feedback/enablement.md`.
  4. Pair with QA to ingest readiness suite evidence (fact IDs, screenshots) into the training materials immediately after they publish.
  5. Coordinate with data on the next Supabase NDJSON export so job aids can reflect real IDs beyond samples 101–104.

## Design & Enablement Alignment — 2025-10-10 23:40 UTC
- Status indicator system is now asset-backed: SVG exports mirrored into runtime at `public/assets/status-icon-healthy.svg`, `public/assets/status-icon-attention.svg`, `public/assets/status-icon-unconfigured.svg`, `public/assets/status-icon-critical.svg`, with TileCard wired to consume them (`app/components/tiles/TileCard.tsx:26`). Focus-visible updates landed in shared tokens (`app/styles/tokens.css:27`, `app/styles/tokens.css:172`) and documented for handoff (`docs/design/tokens/design_tokens.md:71`, `docs/design/tokens/design_tokens.md:422`).
- Tooltip + modal annotations delivered and referenced across partner docs so engineering/enablement can execute without Figma access (`docs/design/tooltip_annotations_2025-10-09.md:3`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/cx_escalations_modal.md:14`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/sales_pulse_modal.md:14`). Sparkline hover asset accompanies the Sales Pulse job aid; enablement log updated with readiness note (`feedback/enablement.md:13`).
- Designer re-acknowledged direction (`docs/directions/designer.md`) and confirmed restart checklist source (`docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`), with status captured in role logs (`feedback/designer.md:11`, `feedback/engineer.md:68`). No progress on Figma workspace unblock—manager escalation still required.
- 2025-10-10 11:10 UTC — Designer delivered final tooltip/focus bundle covering CX Escalations, Sales Pulse, and Inventory Heatmap (`docs/design/tooltip_annotations_2025-10-09.md`, `docs/design/assets/modal-inventory-heatmap-annotations.svg`). Enablement callouts + AI training samples updated with the new asset paths and alt-text guidance (`docs/enablement/job_aids/annotations/2025-10-16_dry_run_callouts.md`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/inventory_heatmap_training_samples.md`); engineering pinged to mirror SVG before next staging deploy (`feedback/engineer.md:8`).
- 2025-10-10 11:25 UTC — Staging host responding (HTTP 200 with `mock=1`). Designer captured baseline dashboard overview screenshot (stored at `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/scenarios/2025-10-10T0421Z_dashboard-overview.png`) to prime enablement/support while we wait for live overlays. Staging build still lacks modal entry points, so Sales Pulse / CX Escalations / Inventory overlays remain blocked; engineering follow-up requested in role log (`feedback/engineer.md:8`).
- 2025-10-10 11:30 UTC — Staging screenshot & overlay checklist published (`docs/design/staging_screenshot_checklist.md`) detailing prerequisites, capture workflow, filenames, and escalation paths. Outstanding blockers called out: (1) Figma workspace access still denied (static SVG overlays continue as fallback), (2) staging modals not yet wired, (3) Supabase sync unresolved so live evidence IDs aren’t available. All logged in `feedback/designer.md:11` for daily tracking.
- 2025-10-10 11:35 UTC — Enablement dry run annotations updated with interim dashboard asset reference so facilitators can brief while waiting on modal overlays (`docs/enablement/job_aids/annotations/2025-10-16_dry_run_callouts.md`). Will replace with annotated modal captures once engineering unlocks staging modals and Figma access restored.
- 2025-10-10 11:40 UTC — Interim modal alt text + focus order doc shipped (`docs/design/modal_alt_text.md`) and linked into enablement callouts. Provides accessibility copy for CX Escalations, Sales Pulse, and Inventory Heatmap modals while staging captures remain blocked.
- **Design blockers (2025-10-10 11:45 UTC):**
  1. Figma workspace access still missing → component library & high-fidelity annotations stalled; tracking in `feedback/designer.md`.
  2. Staging build lacks modal entry points (`?modal=<tile>` routes) → cannot capture annotated overlays or validate focus order live; waiting on engineering follow-up (reconfirmed 2025-10-10T11:45 UTC).
  3. Supabase decision log sync unresolved → live evidence IDs unavailable for screenshots; relying on mock mode and interim copy until reliability unlocks DSN/runbook.
  4. Need confirmation once engineering mirrors `modal-inventory-heatmap-annotations.svg` (and existing modal assets) into staging bundle before next deploy; request logged in `feedback/engineer.md:8`.
- **Design next steps (recommended):**
  1. Partner with engineering to enable CX Escalations/Sales Pulse modals on staging (respond to `feedback/engineer.md:8`) so annotated overlays/focus validation can proceed.
  2. Push for Figma workspace access or approved alternative to package the component library (direction requirement still blocked).
  3. Coordinate with reliability for refreshed Supabase NDJSON export + staging smoke confirmation to unlock live-evidence screenshots.
  4. Once modals unlock, execute the staging screenshot checklist end-to-end and replace interim alt text with final captions.
  5. Prep component library packaging steps (tokens/variants mapping) so handoff is immediate when tooling access lands.
- Next steps: engineering to verify icons/focus indicators in the next staging build, enablement to publish refreshed job aids once staging access clears, and management to secure design tool access or approve continued static bundle workflow.

## Cross-Team Status Snapshot — 2025-10-10 23:50 UTC
- **Engineering:** Dashboard now consumes delivered assets; remaining blocker is Supabase persistence to validate telemetry (needs SLA on staging `DATABASE_URL` + service key usage path). Pending work: run staging build with new icons, close loop on Supabase facts table once reliability provides DSN.
- 2025-10-10T06:13:30Z — Engineering added telemetry to `packages/memory/supabase.ts` capturing retry attempts, Supabase IDs, and rate-limit indicators into optional artifacts to help QA tag decision logs/fact IDs. Unit suite updated (`tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts` now covers telemetry sink) and `npm run test:unit` recorded. Still blocked on Supabase staging IPv4 reachability before Prisma migrations can run.
- 2025-10-10T06:30:28Z — Engineering delivered CX Escalations + Sales Pulse modals under `FEATURE_AGENT_ENGINEER_*` toggles with decision logging + fetcher flows. New action `/actions/sales-pulse/decide` logs follow-ups, and unit evidence added (`tests/unit/salesPulseTile.spec.tsx`, `tests/unit/cxEscalationsTile.spec.tsx`). QA still needs staging access + flag enablement before hooking Playwright coverage.
- 2025-10-10T06:45:00Z — Engineering got stuck finishing Playwright coverage; modal triggers work locally under mock mode, but we can’t validate against staging until (1) reliability confirms IPv4 access for Supabase/Postgres and (2) deployment/QA share the staging credential bundle + flip the new feature flags. Suggestions: (a) coordinate with reliability to supply an IPv4 DSN or proxy for Supabase so Prisma migrations and telemetry replay can run, (b) have deployment pre-seed staging with mock data + enable the feature flags so QA can own the Playwright scenarios, and (c) schedule a joint QA/engineering pairing session to capture the approve/escalate flows once staging access lands.
- 2025-10-10T07:11:09Z — Engineering recommendations queued: (1) reliability to provide an IPv4-accessible Supabase host/proxy so Prisma forward/back drills succeed, (2) deployment/QA to enable `FEATURE_AGENT_ENGINEER_*` toggles in staging once credentials land and coordinate a shared pairing slot for Playwright evidence, (3) extend the new Playwright mock spec into staging coverage as soon as the bundle is live, (4) align with data/AI on tagging Supabase decision IDs and rate-limit telemetry using the new sink, and (5) prep a dry-run readiness checklist linking modals, decision logs, and evidence artifacts.
- **Enablement:** Training packet ready with annotated visuals; distribution on hold until staging access bundle confirmed. Action needed: product/reliability to confirm credential delivery deadlines (`feedback/product.md`, `feedback/reliability.md`).
- **Reliability/Deployment:** Pooler DSN from new direction unblocked the Supabase `facts` migration (applied via `psql`; parity artifact `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json`). REST probe now returns `[]`. Remaining blockers: `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` secret still missing (synthetic check fails DNS) and production secret rotation schedule not yet confirmed. Need manager support to drive smoke URL delivery with product/deployment and lock timing for prod secret mirroring.
- **Design:** Assets delivered despite Figma outage; designer bandwidth still split with integrations. Escalation required to restore design-only focus or delegate integrations load.
- **Outstanding Manager Actions:**
  1. Secure Figma workspace access (or endorse ongoing static asset workflow) so component library handoff can proceed.
  2. Provide decision on Supabase DSN sharing to unblock reliability’s `facts` table migration + engineering telemetry validation.
  3. Confirm timeline for Shopify staging credential dissemination to enablement/support ahead of 2025-10-16 dry run.
  4. Ensure restart cycle checklist adoption across teams by slotting it into next cross-role stand-up agenda.

## Product Status Ping — 2025-10-10 23:59 UTC
- Synthetic check against `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` now connects but returns HTTP 410 (Gone). Artifact captured at `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T02-55-38.615Z.json`; retry moments later (`synthetic-check-2025-10-10T02-55-55.855Z.json`) hit `fetch failed`.
- Supabase parity remains green (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json`); staging install plan refreshed in `docs/deployment/shopify_staging_install_plan.md` with latest evidence and blockers.
- Backlog refresh still on hold per product direction because we lack a green `mock=0` artifact and the Shopify store invite bundle (`DEPLOY-147`) is still pending for QA/support.
- Synthetic smoke gate now green (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json`) after bypassing the bot guard with a Shopify POS user agent + staging token; install plan updated accordingly. Remaining blocker: Shopify store invite bundle (`DEPLOY-147`) still outstanding for QA/support.

## Product Status Ping — 2025-10-10 04:41 UTC
- Synthetic smoke is resolved: `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json` shows HTTP 200 for `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` after adding `SYNTHETIC_CHECK_TOKEN` to Fly secrets and adjusting the probe user agent. `docs/deployment/shopify_staging_install_plan.md` change log updated with the green artifact so Linear/Memory can reference a single canonical plan.
- Deployment + reliability logs reflect the secret add and redeploy (`feedback/deployment.md`, `feedback/reliability.md`); QA log now calls out the passing run and is ready to resume staging validation once access is available.
- Backlog refresh remains blocked on Shopify store invite delivery (`DEPLOY-147`). `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md` still awaits timestamped evidence; once it lands we will immediately post the Linear/Memory update linking Supabase parity + smoke artifacts.
- Next actions: (1) secure DEPLOY-147 handoff and capture evidence, (2) lift backlog hold after posting the combined artifact bundle, (3) schedule QA validation window and notify support once staging access is verified.

## Product Status Ping — 2025-10-10 04:50 UTC
- Escalated DEPLOY-147 again with integrations/deployment after the green smoke artifact landed; both teams re-notified at 04:41 UTC with request to drop store invite instructions plus evidence into `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md` ahead of the 09:00 UTC checkpoint.
- Integrations and deployment logs now reflect the follow-up; product log tracks the same so Linear/Memory updates can flow the moment evidence arrives.
- Current blockers: Shopify store invite still outstanding; GA MCP credentials (OCC-INF-221) remain pending per integrations log but secondary to today’s staging gate.
- Immediate plan: wait for DEPLOY-147 delivery, then (a) attach store invite evidence to the install-plan bundle, (b) push Linear/Memory updates and lift backlog hold, (c) coordinate QA validation window scheduling and notify support/enablement.

## Product Status Ping — 2025-10-10 05:20 UTC
- Status summary: Install plan doc is current, Supabase parity artifact and green `mock=0` smoke (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json`) ready for Linear/Memory. Backlog hold remains because DEPLOY-147 (Shopify staging store invite bundle + evidence) has not been delivered.
- Evidence trail: `feedback/product.md:9-19`, `feedback/deployment.md` and `feedback/integrations.md` now log the 04:41 UTC re-ping; `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md` notes the outstanding handoff awaiting deployment timestamps.
- Blockers: (1) Deployment/integrations must drop store invite instructions + confirmation evidence; (2) QA waiting on that bundle to start admin validation; (3) Marketing/support still blocked on install timeline confirmation tied to the same evidence.
- Next actions: escalate again at 09:00 UTC if deployment silent; once bundle lands, immediately (a) append invite evidence to install plan, (b) update Linear item + Memory with Supabase parity + smoke artifacts, (c) open QA validation window and notify support/enablement with the confirmed timeline.

## Product Status Ping — 2025-10-10 06:05 UTC
- Current state: Install plan (`docs/deployment/shopify_staging_install_plan.md`) includes Supabase parity and green smoke artifact. Linear/Memory updates prepped but withheld per direction until full Shopify readiness evidence arrives. Memory/logs (`feedback/product.md`, `feedback/deployment.md`, `feedback/integrations.md`) capture the 04:41 UTC DEPLOY-147 escalation.
- Blockers:
  1. **DEPLOY-147 Shopify bundle** — deployment still owes store invite instructions + confirmation timestamps; without it QA/support cannot proceed, backlog remains on hold (OCC-212, OCC-Backlog Refresh).
  2. **QA readiness evidence** — QA is waiting on the above bundle to execute admin validation and produce artifacts required to clear backlog locks and publish launch decisions.
  3. **Downstream comms** — marketing/support still blocked on staging access timeline; no Memory/Linear update yet because evidence is incomplete.
- Next steps: maintain escalation pressure on DEPLOY-147 (hard checkpoint 09:00 UTC); once delivered, (a) append invite evidence to `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md`, (b) update Linear + Memory with Supabase parity + smoke artifacts and lift backlog hold, (c) coordinate QA validation window and notify support/marketing of the confirmed install plan.

## Product Status Ping — 2025-10-10 06:45 UTC
- Status recap: Evidence bundle ready (Supabase parity + green smoke) and install plan refreshed; Linear/Memory updates drafted but withheld until DEPLOY-147 delivers shop access confirmation. References: `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json`, `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json`, `docs/deployment/shopify_staging_install_plan.md`.
- Blockers: DEPLOY-147 bundle still missing (store invite instructions + timestamp evidence); QA validation + marketing/support comms blocked until that lands; backlog (OCC-212) remains on hold.
- Recommended next tasks once unblocked:
  1. Publish Linear and Memory updates attaching Supabase parity + smoke artifacts and lift the backlog hold.
  2. Coordinate QA validation window (Prisma forward/back, Shopify parity, Playwright) and capture artifacts in `feedback/qa.md` and `artifacts/migrations/`.
  3. Update Memory (`scope="ops"`) with staging install timeline and evidence bundle for leadership visibility.
  4. Notify marketing/support with confirmed staging access steps so comms/training can resume.
  5. Refresh dry-run checklist/enablement materials with final invite instructions and assign owners in partner logs.

## Detailed Rollup — Pending / Completed Items

  - Pending: Staging access bundle delivery; enablement holding publication until credentials confirmed.
- **Reliability / Deployment**
  - Completed: Staging secrets vaulted and partially synced (`feedback/reliability.md:11-16`, helper scripts staged in `scripts/deploy/`).
  - Pending: GitHub production secret population, Supabase DSN sharing, restart checklist integration into operating rhythm.
- **Product / QA**
  - Completed: Product log captures staging bundle dependency (`feedback/product.md:11-19`); QA awaits enablement assets to wire into validation plans.
  - Pending: Evidence for Supabase monitor + rate-limit recovery before backlog refresh; QA to receive sparkline/screenshot evidence post-staging check.

## Support Dry Run Alignment — 2025-10-10 19:10 UTC
- Published Shopify dry run checklist (`docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md`) and stood up evidence scaffold at `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/` (scenarios, metrics, logs, recordings placeholders) so cross-team inputs can land immediately once assets arrive.
- Added rate-limit recovery playbook (`docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md`) and wired into the dry run checklist so facilitators brief operators on the new scripts during the T-24 sync.
- Published operator Q&A capture template (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md`) so enablement/support/product can log questions live and drive follow-ups from a single artifact.
- Logged fresh asks in partner feedback streams: product to confirm staging access bundle ETA by 2025-10-12 (`feedback/product.md:37-40`), enablement to assign note-taking/recording owners (`feedback/enablement.md:23-33`), and support next steps updated to reference checklist status sync (`feedback/support.md:11-30`).
- Support staged validation queue plan (per `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`) and is ready to execute once credentials land; comms update pending product handoff, see `feedback/support.md:16-23`.
- Awaiting staging credentials/design overlays/nightly metrics before checklist can flip to in-progress; will escalate if product/deployment do not reply by the requested deadline.

## Support Sprint Status — 2025-10-10 21:05 UTC
- **Rate-limit integration:** Enablement coaching guide now points to the support playbook for evidence capture (`docs/enablement/job_aids/shopify_sync_rate_limit_coaching.md:41-44`). Support logged completion and seeded artifact folders in `feedback/support.md:11-23`. Reliability still needs to confirm the retry script path (`npm run ops:retry-shopify-sync -- --scope all`) is ready ahead of the dry run; escalate if missing at the T-24 facilitator sync.
- **Validation queue readiness:** Support reviewed the checklist in `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` and documented readiness steps in `feedback/support.md:16-23`. Shopify staging credentials (`DEPLOY-147`) remain the blocker; product/deployment committed to provide an ETA by 2025-10-12 (`feedback/product.md:37-40`). Once delivered, support will run staging deploy + smoke, drop logs under `artifacts/integrations/shopify/`, and coordinate contract tests with data.
- **Dry run coordination:** Operator training agenda updated with staging install readiness steps (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md:28-43`), Q&A template (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md`) is live, and checklist now tracks staging install verification (row 6). Enablement/product must populate attendee roster, note-taking, and recording ownership (tracked in `feedback/enablement.md:23-33`). Support will seed outstanding questions (staging access, rate-limit comms) by 2025-10-12 if trainer inputs arrive. Calendar invite, pre-read, and facilitator briefing remain blocked on the credential bundle; support will send immediately once enablement signals readiness.
- **Risks & escalations:** If credentials slip past 2025-10-12, support will escalate per dry-run checklist risk triggers (`docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md:88-93`). Enablement still owes confirmation on note-taking/recording coverage so Memory + artifact updates remain consistent.

## Manager Brief — 2025-10-10 22:20 UTC
- **Operator playbooks updated:** Training agenda now covers Shopify Admin staging install steps, feature-flag verification, and Supabase decision-log checks at the open (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md:28`, `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md:56`). Rate-limit playbook includes a staging install checklist and change log entry so facilitators capture evidence during prep (`docs/runbooks/shopify_rate_limit_recovery.md:56`). Dry-run checklist gained a T-24 item to confirm attendees can launch OCC once credentials land (`docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md:52`).
- **Evidence + tooling prepped:** Support created the operator Q&A template (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md`) and pre-seeded artifact folders (`artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/`). Validation plan from `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` is staged; support logged readiness in `feedback/support.md:16-26` and awaits DEPLOY-147 secrets before running deploy + smoke.
- **Pending handoffs:** Product/deployment must deliver the Shopify staging bundle by 2025-10-12 (`feedback/product.md:37-40`) and confirm OCC install instructions; enablement needs to assign note-taking/recording owners and signal go/no-go for invite send (`feedback/enablement.md:23-27`). Reliability still owes confirmation that the retry script (`npm run ops:retry-shopify-sync -- --scope all`) is ready for escalation; if silent by T-24 sync, expect escalation.
- **Next actions:** As soon as enablement waves green (assets + owners) and staging credentials land, support will blast invites/pre-read, run staging validation (deploy + smoke + contract tests), and capture evidence in `artifacts/ops/dry_run_2025-10-16/`. If DEPLOY-147 slips past deadline, support escalates per risk table (`docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md:88-93`).

## Enablement Dry Run Prep — 2025-10-10 18:30 UTC
- Enablement consolidated the 2025-10-16 training packet with confirmed facilitator roster (Product — Justin, Support — Morgan Patel, Enablement — Justin) and Supabase evidence references; see `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md` and log entry in `feedback/enablement.md:13`.
- Supabase staging service key path (`vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env`) and monitor artifacts double-checked for enablement use; reliability alignment tracked in `feedback/reliability.md:11-16`.
- Interim visual callouts delivered while design assets remain blocked (`docs/enablement/job_aids/annotations/2025-10-16_dry_run_callouts.md`); designer log updated to swap for annotated overlays once Figma access returns.
- Support/product logs mirror the roster confirmation and pending staging access package before invites send (`feedback/support.md:41-47`, `feedback/product.md:22-26`).
- Restart cycle checklist now tracked in repo (`docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`) and referenced across enablement materials for dry-run prep.

## Enablement Sprint Status — 2025-10-10 20:05 UTC
- All three AI dry-run kits (CX Escalations, Sales Pulse, Inventory Heatmap) refreshed with telemetry callouts and facilitator prompts so operators capture Supabase decision IDs, timestamps, and stakeholder follow-ups during the rehearsal. README now advertises the coverage and matches the 2025-10-10 direction task (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/*.md`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/README.md`).
- Shopify sync rate-limit coaching guide circulated to support and product; both channels logged the handoff and are preparing feedback on tone/escalation flow (`feedback/support.md:65-70`, `feedback/product.md:52-53`). Enablement log notes outreach and will track requested tweaks (`feedback/enablement.md:35-37`).
- Supabase evidence expectations aligned across enablement, product, and QA: dry run will capture decision log IDs + annotated screenshots per scenario; QA committed to validate artifacts once staging secrets land (`feedback/qa.md:11-16`, `feedback/product.md:52-53`).
- Outstanding dependencies before invite send: product/deployment still owe staging access package delivery and confirmation that Supabase/Shopify secrets are mirrored; support reviewing rate-limit coaching copy and will return comments; design to replace text callouts with annotated overlays once Figma access restored.
- Next planned actions: finalize job aids with design assets, incorporate support/product feedback into the rate-limit script, update operator training agenda with confirmed note-taking owners, and send dry run invites immediately after staging credentials are verified.

## Enablement Status Check-in — 2025-10-10 20:40 UTC
- Supabase staging DSN now confirmed in vault (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) and mirrored to GitHub; waiting on deployment/reliability to complete MCP run and drop the Shopify staging credential bundle before outbound communications go live.
- Rate-limit coaching guide (`docs/enablement/job_aids/shopify_sync_rate_limit_coaching.md`) and refreshed training kits remain queued; per direction, we will send to support/product immediately once staging access is confirmed and capture acknowledgements plus requested tweaks in `feedback/enablement.md`.
- Current blockers: Shopify staging bundle pending MCP automation; design overlays still outstanding for annotated job aid visuals (text callouts in place). No other enablement work is blocked.
- Prepared next steps: as soon as access is confirmed, dispatch kits + coaching packet, update `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md` with note-taking owner assignments, and log confirmations (enablement/support/product/QA) in feedback files for audit.

## Enablement Action Tracker — 2025-10-10 21:05 UTC
- **Docs updated today:**
  - AI kit telemetry/facilitation notes (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/cx_escalations_training_samples.md`, `sales_pulse_training_samples.md`, `inventory_heatmap_training_samples.md`).
  - AI samples README aligned with sprint focus (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/README.md`).
  - Training packet change log extended with Supabase vault reference and facilitator roster (`docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`).
- **Feedback logs touched:** enablement (`feedback/enablement.md:23-37`), support (`feedback/support.md:65-70`), product (`feedback/product.md:52-53`), QA (`feedback/qa.md:11-16`), reliability (`feedback/reliability.md:11-16`) to keep cross-team visibility on handoffs.
- **Pending delivery checklist:**
  1. Receive Shopify staging bundle drop (deployment/reliability → enablement). Manager said MCP run in flight; action owner will ping once done.
  2. On receipt, send rate-limit coaching packet + AI kits to support/product with explicit ask for acknowledgement and feedback; log timestamps + requested edits in `feedback/enablement.md`.
  3. Mirror any coaching edits into `docs/enablement/job_aids/shopify_sync_rate_limit_coaching.md` before final dry-run distribution.
  4. Swap temporary callouts for final annotated overlays once design regains Figma access; update job aids and note completion in enablement log.
- **Readiness outlook:** content is publish-ready, evidence plan agreed with product/QA, and Supabase access confirmed; only gating item is Shopify staging credential bundle to unlock communications and final rehearsals.

-## Reliability Escalation — 2025-10-10 16:20 UTC
- Supabase staging credentials vaulted: service key at `occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env`, Postgres `DATABASE_URL` at `occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`; NDJSON evidence bundle (`artifacts/logs/supabase_ndjson_bundle_2025-10-10.tar.gz`) shared with engineering/data. Awaiting guidance on mirroring to GitHub `production` env and any additional evidence needs.
- Shopify staging bundle now stored in vault (`occ/shopify/api_key_staging.env`, `api_secret_staging.env`, `cli_auth_token_staging.env`, `app_url_staging.env`, `shop_domain_staging.env`); deployment queued to sync GitHub `staging` environment secrets via `scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh`. Request manager confirm if production equivalents should be generated ahead of dry-run.
- Executed `gh api repos/Jgorzitza/HotDash/environments/staging` followed by helper script runs to set Supabase + Shopify staging secrets (`DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_KEY_STAGING`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_STAGING`, `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING`, `STAGING_APP_URL`, `STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN`) at 2025-10-09T21:44Z; staging workflows now unblocked pending CLI validation check.
- Supabase `facts` table still missing: REST probe returned `PGRST205 Could not find the table 'public.facts'`. Need Postgres DSN (not HTTPS URL) or Supabase SQL access to run `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql`; please advise on credential path so reliability can finish the migration.
- Attempted pooler connection using inferred host `aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com` with service-role key as password (including `options=project=<ref>`); pooler responded `FATAL: Tenant or user not found`, confirming we require the actual Postgres password/DSN export from Supabase settings.
- 22:32 UTC update: Applied Supabase-provided password (`[REDACTED_PASSWORD]`, URL encoded) from vault DSN and re-ran `npx prisma db execute --file supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql`; connection still returns `FATAL: Tenant or user not found` against the pooler. Direct host `db.<ref>.supabase.co` remains unreachable (IPv6-only). Pending guidance on correct Postgres user/credentials so reliability can finish the migration and capture parity evidence. Shopify staging bundle re-validated via `shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh --check` and all vault secrets re-synced to GitHub `staging` to keep deployment unblocked. Additional parity log captured at `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-09T22-30-16Z.json` reflecting the ongoing block.
- 22:55 UTC addendum: Following new instructions, attempted raw DSN + `psql` against direct host; IPv6 network remains unavailable, while pooler host continues to reject credentials with `Tenant or user not found`. Reliability awaiting confirmation on proper Postgres connection parameters or IPv4 access.
- ## Reliability Deep Status — 2025-10-10 22:15 UTC
- Direction compliance (`docs/directions/reliability.md:25-33`): staging Shopify bundle and Supabase service key/HTTPS URL are vaulted and mirrored to GitHub `staging`; evidence logged in `feedback/reliability.md:22-47` and `feedback/deployment.md:1-18`.
- Remaining blocker is the Supabase Postgres DSN required to execute `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql`. REST probe (`curl …/rest/v1/facts`) and parity script (`npm run ops:check-analytics-parity`) both report the `facts` table missing (`reason: supabase.facts_table_missing`).
- Attempts to synthesize a DSN using the service-role key against regional pooler hosts (`aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com`) fail with `FATAL: Tenant or user not found`, indicating we need the actual database password exported from Supabase (`Project Settings → Database → Connection string`).
- Without that DSN, Prisma CLI cannot connect (`P1001 Can't reach database server`) and the SQL migration cannot run; staging telemetry remains blocked on this step.
- Request manager to supply or authorize access to the canonical Postgres connection string (service password + host/port) so reliability can immediately run the migration, rerun parity for pass evidence, and close the direction item.
- Restart-cycle checklist now back in canon (`docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`); reliability log updated accordingly (`feedback/reliability.md:11-16`). Next step is to align on mirroring instructions within the runbook before the next drill.

## Deployment Sync — 2025-10-10 23:05 UTC
- Shopify Dev MCP staging auth helper now available at `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh`; deployment logged readiness + checklist dependency in `feedback/deployment.md:9-12`. Manager visibility needed to slot this into the restart cycle once the canonical runbook is finalized.

## Deployment Update — 2025-10-10 23:47 UTC
- Staging deploy orchestrator (`scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`) and CLI wrapper (`scripts/ops/run-shopify-cli.mjs`) updated per direction to align with the latest `shopify app deploy` flags (`--client-id`, `SHOPIFY_FLAG_STORE`). Structured logs now capture client IDs for audit.
- Staging redeploy with live credentials succeeded (Shopify release `hot-dash-5`); evidence captured in `artifacts/engineering/shopify_cli/2025-10-09T22-26-01.757Z-staging-app-deploy.json` and `artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-20251009T222601Z.log`.
- Synthetic smoke helper recreated (`scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs`); multiple runs continue to fail with `fetch failed` for `https://staging.hotdash.app/app?mock=0` (artifacts `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-09T22-26-09.805Z.json`, `...22-28-06.607Z.json`). Reliability needs to confirm host reachability or provide an alternate smoke endpoint before we can log a green run.
- GitHub `staging` secret `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` now populated via `gh secret set`; workflows receive the target, but DNS resolution for `staging.hotdash.app` still fails, so smoke artifacts remain red.
- Fly staging host provisioned via `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl launch --name hotdash-staging --no-deploy --yes` + `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl deploy --remote-only --yes`; config artifacts (`fly.toml`, `dbsetup.js`, `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`) committed. Dedicated IPv4 allocated (`149.248.193.17`) and secrets updated to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app` (`vault/occ/shopify/app_url_staging.env`, `.env.staging`, Fly + GitHub `staging`). Manual curl with `--resolve` returns HTTP 200 and the updated synthetic helper logs success (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T02-31-11.417Z.json`), but automated runs still see intermittent `fetch failed` while DNS propagates (latest failure `...02-34-28.341Z.json`). Reliability to confirm DNS stability so the smoke step stops flapping.
- Fly staging host provisioned via `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl launch --name hotdash-staging --no-deploy --yes` and `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl deploy --remote-only --yes`; generated `fly.toml`, `dbsetup.js`, and GitHub `fly-deploy` workflow. Updated app/vault secrets to use `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app`, patched Docker entry (`dbsetup.js`, `package.json:start`) to bind `0.0.0.0`, and removed stray autogenerated app (`hotdash-staging-falling-meadow-8504*`). Despite the deploy, `curl https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` from the runner still fails (DNS/connectivity), so synthetic smoke evidence remains blocked pending reliability validation of the new endpoint.
- GitHub `staging` environment now exists (created via `gh api …/environments/staging`) with Supabase secrets synced from vault; `.env.staging` templated for QA using vault Supabase values, still awaiting real Postgres `DATABASE_URL` + Shopify staging bundle.
- Blocking next steps: reliability to 1) resolve staging smoke endpoint access (current `fetch failed`) and 2) hand off the Postgres `DATABASE_URL` so QA can exercise migrations; deployment will rerun synthetic + Lighthouse once those land.

## Localization Update — 2025-10-10 22:15 UTC
- Canon restored: Authored `docs/directions/localization.md` with explicit English-only guardrails, audit workflow ownership (UI routes, tile components, Chatwoot templates, runbooks), partner/vendor escalation paths, and sprint focus on the 2025-10-16 dry run alignment. Document is now live with `last_reviewed: 2025-10-09`.
- English-only audit complete: Reviewed shipping UI (`app/routes/app._index.tsx`, all tile components, TileCard wrapper), service templates (`app/services/chatwoot/templates.ts`), enablement/runbook surfaces (`docs/runbooks/*.md`, `docs/directions/support.md`, `docs/directions/enablement.md`), and collateral. No non-English strings detected; only sanctioned FR references remain in translation packets (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`, tooltip handoffs) per guidance. Logged evidence in `feedback/localization.md` and noted en dash usage as the only non-ASCII punctuation.
- AI/QA alignment: Verified AI suggestion coverage in `scripts/qa/soak-test-plan.md` remains scoped to English-only outputs and confirmed QA direction still targets the same guardrails. No telemetry discrepancies observed in mock dashboards or SSE scripts.
- Partner & vendor touchpoints: Preparing follow-ups to marketing/support to confirm translation vendors stay paused during English-only scope. Will document acknowledgements and any reactivation triggers in `feedback/localization.md` once responses land.
- Restart cycle checklist: `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md` now tracked; reviewed for localization impact and confirmed no additional checkpoints needed beyond existing guardrails. Included audit confirmation and pending partner outreach in the localization feedback log.

## Product Feedback Sync — 2025-10-10
- Restart checklist restored in canon (`docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`); product log updated with stash evidence (`feedback/product.md:11`).
- Supabase telemetry bundle delivered (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_sample.ndjson`, `artifacts/logs/supabase_ndjson_bundle_2025-10-10.tar.gz`, `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`) — product ready to attach when refreshing M1/M2 backlog.
- Deployment confirmation on Supabase staging secret load (vault + GitHub `staging` environment per `docs/runbooks/supabase_staging_secret_handoff.md`) still pending; follow-up sent and tracked in product log (`feedback/product.md:17`-`feedback/product.md:24`).
- Shopify validation plan staged in product log (`feedback/product.md:20`-`feedback/product.md:33`): partner app config verified, install timeline drafted, owners mapped (Product, QA, Integrations) pending credential drop; Linear/Memory updates ready once secrets land.
- QA evidence still outstanding; backlog refresh remains on hold until forward/back logs + Shopify parity artifacts post. Product standing by to attach evidence to Linear/Memory and clear the hold the moment QA publishes outputs.		
- Direction reminder logged: as soon as QA archives Prisma forward/back and Shopify parity evidence, product will attach artifacts in Linear/Memory, lift the backlog hold, and finalize the install timeline (`feedback/product.md:18`-`feedback/product.md:33`).		
- Supabase staging DSN (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`, GitHub `staging`) confirmed; only outstanding inputs are deployment’s staging redeploy + QA evidence bundle before the backlog refresh proceeds. Integration Shopify credentials (`DEPLOY-147`) still pending reliability/deployment handoff; product ready to publish updates immediately after confirmation.		

## Product Portfolio Status — 2025-10-11 17:05 UTC
- **Backlog refresh**: still in hold per direction until QA posts Prisma forward/back + Shopify parity evidence. Supabase telemetry artifacts already staged for attachment; Linear/Memory update and hold removal will occur immediately after QA drops logs.
- **Supabase staging coverage**: DSN + service key confirmed in vault/GitHub; waiting on deployment to re-run staging deploy and on reliability to finish MCP auth handshake before QA can execute live validation. Parity rerun queued behind Supabase `facts` migration.
- **Shopify install timeline**: partner config validated (`shopify.app.toml`); owner matrix drafted (Product coordination, QA validation, Integrations credential stewardship). Execution blocked on `DEPLOY-147` (Shopify credential bundle). Direction reminder noted in product log so action triggers the moment evidence arrives.
- **Next manager asks**: 1) Nudge reliability/deployment to close `DEPLOY-147` and confirm staging redeploy window, 2) ensure QA prioritizes evidence archive once staging deploy completes so backlog hold can lift, 3) keep leadership looped once upstream blockers clear so Memory/Linear updates can ship without delay.

## Engineering Shopify Admin Readiness — 2025-10-09 22:20 UTC
- Executed `shopify app config link` via the new wrapper (`node scripts/ops/run-shopify-cli.mjs --label config-link -- app config link --client-id 4f72376ea61be956c860dd020552124d`); structured transcript at `artifacts/engineering/shopify_cli/2025-10-09T21-51-16.348Z-config-link.json` confirms the repo is tied to the Partner app with staging context.
- Updated `shopify.app.toml` and `shopify.web.toml` to swap placeholder URLs/scopes for staging values (`https://staging.hotdash.app/app`, scopes `read_products,read_orders,read_inventory,read_fulfillments`, dev store `hotdash-staging.myshopify.com`). Auth redirects now hit `/auth/callback` and `/auth/login` so QA installs won’t bounce.
- Prisma SQLite migrations verified clean (`npx prisma migrate deploy --schema prisma/schema.prisma`). Postgres deploy remains blocked: we only have the Supabase REST URL; need a proper `postgresql://` DSN in vault/GitHub secrets to run `prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`.
- `npm run setup` fails during `prisma generate` because `node_modules/.prisma/client/index.js` is root-owned (EACCES unlink). Recommend chowning `node_modules/.prisma` or reinstalling dependencies without sudo before the next generate.
- QA is briefed (`feedback/qa.md:8-13`) and ready to pair on live Shopify Admin validation as soon as staging Postgres credentials drop; they’re holding forward/back drills until deployment/reliability delivers the DSN.
- 2025-10-09 22:28 UTC: Loaded the DSN from `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env` and reran `npm run db:migrate:postgres`; Prisma now reaches the Supabase pooler but exits with `FATAL: Tenant or user not found`, so forward/rollback validation is still blocked. Parity script rerun (`npm run ops:check-analytics-parity`) continues to report `supabase.facts_table_missing`; JSON evidence logged in terminal. Engineering/QA remain on standby pending reliability deploying `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` and confirming the Postgres credentials.
  - Evidence: command output captured in terminal (timestamps 2025-10-09T22:20-22:28Z); parity JSON already reflected in QA log.
  - Action needed: reliability to supply working Postgres role credentials (or rotate service role) and execute `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql`. Once done, engineer will rerun `npm run db:migrate:postgres`, perform rollback verification, and attach logs under `artifacts/migrations/`; QA will then execute the live Shopify Admin validation checklist with engineering pairing.
  - Follow-up: engineer flagged the root-owned `node_modules/.prisma` issue so deployment/infra can plan remediation prior to the next `prisma generate`.

## Integrations Escalation — 2025-10-10 15:30 UTC
- GA MCP: Manager escalation with infra confirms OCC-INF-221 remains open; infra owed credential ETA by 17:00 UTC but missed it. Onboarding tracker updated with action items and fallback path (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`), readiness dashboard refreshed with missed deadline (`docs/integrations/integration_readiness_dashboard.md`), evidence folder staged (`artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/`).
- Shopify readiness: Secret bundle `DEPLOY-147` still pending; integrations staged evidence folder for immediate deploy logs (`artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/`) and refreshed readiness doc (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`) to reflect outstanding actions.
- Shopify follow-up: Integrations pinged deployment at 17:30 UTC to close `DEPLOY-147`, deliver Shopify shop access, and confirm secret sync; no acknowledgement yet as of 19:05 UTC.
- Request: Please escalate directly (CIO queue) if infra still silent by 18:00 UTC and back us on deployment if they remain silent after the 19:00 UTC response window on `DEPLOY-147`; integrations prepared fallback messaging for evening check-in.

## Integrations Deep Dive — 2025-10-10 19:15 UTC
- **GA MCP (OCC-INF-221):** Missed 17:00 UTC ETA; infra responded “ASAP” without timeline. Evidence folder prepped (`artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/`), onboarding doc updated with contingency and CIO escalation trigger for 2025-10-11 09:00 UTC. Awaiting infra update; if silent past 18:00 UTC, recommend you escalate to CIO queue to keep analytics launch on track.
- **Shopify DEPLOY-147:** Despite deployment’s earlier note that secrets were synced, integrations has not received confirmation or store access instructions. Follow-up sent 17:30 UTC, still no acknowledgment at 19:05 UTC. Readiness dashboard + Shopify readiness doc both reflect the blocker; request your escalation if deployment remains silent so QA can begin validation.
- **Supabase staging secrets:** Reliability still owes final database URL confirmation despite deployment claiming vault sync; readiness dashboard keeps Supabase row flagged. No action required unless you can accelerate reliability’s response.
- **Next 4 hours:** Integrations will ping infra again at 18:05 UTC and prep CIO escalation note. If deployment stays unresponsive by 19:15 UTC, expect a formal escalation request so we can lock store access and close DEPLOY-147. Mock-mode fallback messaging is ready for evening leadership sync should GA MCP remain blocked.

## Integrations Status — 2025-10-10 22:35 UTC
- Supabase staging DSN is confirmed in vault (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) and mirrored to the GitHub `staging` environment. QA now unblocked on Prisma migrations once Shopify credentials land; coordination in progress (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` current state updated).
- Reliability preparing to run the Shopify Dev MCP staging helper; once they deliver the MCP host + CLI token, integrations will capture evidence in `artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/`, update onboarding checklist, and notify you for CIO escalation cancellation.
- DEPLOY-147 still open: deployment has not acknowledged the 17:30 UTC follow-up. Readiness dashboard documents the blocker; escalate to deployment leadership if we remain silent after the 19:15 UTC window so QA/product receive shop access tonight.
- Readiness artifacts (dashboard + brief) now reflect GA MCP SLA breach, Shopify credential gap, and Supabase DSN delivery. No additional action needed from you until the 18:05 UTC infra ping outcome—expect an update immediately after.
- Direction executed: integrations re-read `docs/directions/integrations.md`, aligned next steps (MCP helper coordination, DEPLOY-147 closure, readiness updates), and staged store access evidence plan (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` action log, `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/`).

## Integrations Status — 2025-10-10 23:05 UTC (Deep Dive)
- **GA MCP (OCC-INF-221):**
  - 18:05 UTC ping pending; if infra still silent, escalation to CIO queue triggers at 2025-10-11 09:00 UTC.
  - Reliability is on standby with `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh`; once infra shares the MCP host + credential bundle they will run the helper, mirror secrets to vault/GitHub, and pass evidence for onboarding checklist completion.
  - Evidence staging folder `artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/` ready for host screenshot, CLI token log, secret audit proof, and `curl` transcript. Onboarding tracker (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`) updated with these follow-ups.
- **Shopify DEPLOY-147 / Staging Access (`hotroddash.myshopify.com`):**
  - Deployment still hasn’t acknowledged the 17:30 UTC follow-up. Direction requires integrations to close the ticket; we’re prepared to update `vault/occ/shopify/shop_domain_staging.env`, capture the bundle, and distribute access instructions via `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md` immediately once credentials land.
  - Readiness dashboard row (`docs/integrations/integration_readiness_dashboard.md`) now references the target store and pending credential bundle; readiness brief (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`) lists remaining tasks and evidence plan.
  - Request: If deployment remains silent after 19:15 UTC, please escalate so we can deliver store access tonight.
- **Supabase Staging DSN / QA Coordination:**
  - DSN delivered and mirrored to GitHub; QA can refresh `.env.staging` as soon as Shopify credentials arrive. Integrations coordinating to ensure migrations/tests run once DEPLOY-147 closes.
- **Next 4 Hours:**
  1. Ping infra in OCC-INF-221 at 18:05 UTC and update you on response (or trigger CIO escalation prep).
  2. Work with reliability to execute MCP helper immediately once host bundle arrives; collect evidence and update onboarding/readiness docs.
  3. Close DEPLOY-147 by recording credential delivery, updating vault/GitHub entries, and distributing `hotroddash.myshopify.com` access details to deployment/QA/product.
  4. Publish dashboard/brief updates with evidence links and notify you once all three items (MCP host, DEPLOY-147 closure, store access handoff) are complete.

## QA Intake Sync — 2025-10-11
- QA acknowledged `docs/directions/qa.md:1` and reinstated `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md:1`; intake notes logged in `feedback/qa.md:11`.
- Shopify validation scope published (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`) with dependencies on staging `DATABASE_URL` and Admin store credentials; integrations notified but still blocked.
- Deployment still owes the Postgres staging `DATABASE_URL` secret; without it the queued migration forward/back drill (`scripts/qa/test-migration-rollback.sh`) cannot run. Please push deployment/reliability for the vault + GitHub secret drop today.
- Restored Shopify client retry/backoff wrapper (`app/services/shopify/client.ts`); `npm run test:unit` green (24 assertions) confirming rate-limit handling ahead of validation suite.

## QA Blocker Update — 2025-10-11 22:36 UTC
- Supabase DSN loaded into `.env.staging` (from `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) but Prisma forward/back drill blocked — latest run (2025-10-09T22:35Z) shows `npm run db:generate:postgres` failing to unlink root-owned `.prisma` client and `npm run db:migrate:postgres` returning `P1001` (IPv6-only host). Evidence: `artifacts/migrations/20251009T223546Z/db-generate.log`, `artifacts/migrations/20251009T223546Z/db-migrate.log`, `artifacts/migrations/20251009T223546Z/nc-check.log`.
- Need deployment/engineering to reset ownership on `node_modules/.prisma` (currently root-owned) or regenerate client in clean workspace so future `db:generate:postgres` invocations succeed without EACCES.
- Playwright readiness (`npm run test:e2e`) PASS; Lighthouse audit still failing (`ChromeLauncher ECONNREFUSED`), even after updating `scripts/ci/run-lighthouse.mjs` to spawn Node wrapper. Latest logs: `artifacts/migrations/20251009T223546Z/test-e2e.log`, `artifacts/migrations/20251009T223546Z/test-lighthouse.log`, `artifacts/migrations/20251009T222451Z/lighthouse-cli.log`.
- Shopify GraphQL parity still waiting on Admin credential bundle (`DEPLOY-147`); cannot hit live API. Fixtures ready, but no tokens delivered yet.
- Synthetic telemetry check via `scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` failed (`fetch` against staging) — see `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-09T22-37-22.064Z.json`; reliability should confirm staging host, TLS, and DNS before next run.
- Request deployment to supply IPv4-accessible Postgres endpoint (or tunneling guidance), ship Chrome install/runner guidance, and deliver Shopify Admin credential bundle so QA can finish readiness suite.

## Direction Refresh — 2025-10-10 08:46 UTC
- Updated product, QA, AI, enablement, support, deployment, reliability, and localization direction docs to align on Supabase staging secret delivery, Shopify validation scope, rate-limit coaching, and dry-run prep; all now last_reviewed 2025-10-10.
- Canon runbook `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md` restored to tracked state; awaiting deployment evidence before closing the escalation.
- Dependencies remain: deployment/reliability to deliver Supabase staging `DATABASE_URL` + Shopify admin credentials; deployment to mirror secrets + rerun staging smoke; enablement/support to circulate rate-limit coaching/snippets and log follow-ups.

## Direction Refresh — 2025-10-10 09:42 UTC
- Issued updated direction for engineer, QA, data, integrations, marketing, designer, and compliance to refocus idle roles on Shopify admin readiness—each now calls out Supabase staging secrets, Shopify credential pathways, and evidence capture expectations.
- Reaffirmed priority tasks: 1) reliability to deliver Supabase staging `DATABASE_URL`/service key + Shopify credential plan, 2) deployment to sync secrets, prep `.env.staging`, and rerun smoke, 3) enablement/support to publish the rate-limit coaching kit and align operator training.
- Expect QA/engineer to execute Shopify admin validation immediately after secret delivery, with data marketing compliance mirroring telemetry/privacy evidence in their logs.
- Added role-level follow-ups (reliability, deployment, integrations, engineer, QA, data, product, enablement, support, marketing) so the Shopify CLI install path is unblocked: vault drops, CLI linking, toml/scopes, Prisma migrations, readiness suite, parity notebooks, and comms/trainings all now tracked in their feedback logs.
- Reliability re-synced Shopify/Supabase staging secrets to GitHub; deployment attempted staging deploy but CLI flags have changed — script updates required before rerun. Need engineer/deployment to adjust `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` for latest `shopify app deploy` usage.

## Marketing Escalations — 2025-10-10 21:11 UTC
- **Launch window (Product):** No response after the 2025-10-09 20:25 ET follow-up. Please escalate if still silent by 2025-10-10 14:00 UTC (10:00 ET) so marketing can lock ESP holds and campaign calendar updates (`docs/marketing/shopify_launch_comms_backlog.md` item #1).
- **Tooltip placement overlays (Design):** No annotated overlays delivered despite 2025-10-10 AM ET commitment; marketing escalated at 14:00 UTC to unblock engineering handoff (`docs/marketing/shopify_launch_comms_backlog.md` item #2).
- **Telemetry evidence (Reliability/Data):** Supabase staging service key + Postgres DSN now vaulted (`vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env`, `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) and analyzer snapshot logged at `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`; still waiting on full NDJSON export + retry parity rerun before marketing can close backlog item #6.

## Escalation Triggered — 2025-10-10 14:00 UTC
- Marketing executed the planned escalation for the launch window decision and tooltip overlays. Awaiting product/design response so comms scheduling and engineering handoff can proceed.

### Marketing Comprehensive Update — 2025-10-10 22:30 UTC
- **Launch window & scheduling:** Product still silent post-escalation. Campaign calendar (`docs/marketing/campaign_calendar_2025-10.md`) plus ESP staging remain on hold; `docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md` retains relative timing until product provides a date. Backlog item #1 recorded as escalated (`docs/marketing/shopify_launch_comms_backlog.md`).
- **Design overlays:** No annotated tooltip placements received. Engineering cannot wire the banner/tooltips without them. Backlog item #2 remains escalated; marketing is prepped to drop overlays into the handoff within two hours of receipt (`docs/marketing/tooltip_copy_handoff_2025-10-07.md`).
- **Telemetry readiness:** Reliability vaulted Supabase staging service key + Postgres DSN (`vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env`, `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) and synced GitHub `staging` secrets (2025-10-09 21:44-21:58Z per `feedback/reliability.md`). Analyzer snapshot captured at `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json` and now referenced in the comms packet (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`) and timeline playbook. Full NDJSON export + retry parity rerun still pending before marketing can cite stabilized KPIs (backlog item #6).
- **Comms artifacts updated:** Launch comms packet (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`) and timeline playbook (`docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md`) now include staging readiness evidence, vault locations, and analyzer context per sprint focus (`docs/directions/marketing.md`). Snapshot refreshed in `docs/marketing/shopify_launch_comms_backlog.md`.
- **Enablement handoff:** Support training script + FAQ ready, but distribution waits on staging credentials confirmation from product/deployment and the missing tooltip overlays so rate-limit coaching snippet stays accurate. Backlog item #8 tracks dependency chain.
- **Immediate manager ask:** Secure product reply with launch window and drive design to deliver overlays. Also push reliability/data for the full Supabase NDJSON export so marketing can lock KPI narrative and finish the evidence bundle (`artifacts/marketing/launch/2025-10-PT` placeholder).

### Marketing Status Deep Dive — 2025-10-10 21:33 UTC
- **Launch window (Product):** Escalation sent at 14:00 UTC after no reply to the 20:25 ET follow-up (2025-10-09). Campaign calendar (`docs/marketing/campaign_calendar_2025-10.md`) and ESP staging remain blocked; marketing is holding `docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md` updates until product confirms the go-live window. Triage doc: `docs/marketing/shopify_launch_comms_backlog.md` item #1.
- **Tooltip overlays (Design):** No annotated assets received despite the AM commitment. Marketing cannot hand Polaris banner placement and tooltip copy to engineering without them. Backlog item #2 tracks the escalation; marketing will notify engineering within two hours of receipt. Evidence placeholders live in `docs/marketing/tooltip_copy_handoff_2025-10-07.md`.
- **Telemetry dependencies (Reliability/Data):** Supabase staging service key + Postgres DSN now vaulted (`vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env`, `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) with GitHub `staging` sync logged 2025-10-09 21:44-21:58Z. Analyzer snapshot captured (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`). Still waiting on full NDJSON export + retry parity rerun before marketing references KPIs; backlog item #6 tracks the remaining gap (see `feedback/reliability.md`, `docs/insights/2025-10-09_supabase_decision_sync.md`).
- **Enablement handoff:** Support training script (`docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md`) and FAQ ready. Awaiting staging credentials and tooltip overlays to embed Shopify rate-limit coaching snippet before sharing with enablement/support (backlog item #8).
- **Ready-to-ship assets:** In-app banner, launch email, blog copy approved (see `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md`). Marketing has ESP slot and blog CMS draft prepped but paused pending launch window decision. Evidence bundle will land under `artifacts/marketing/launch/2025-10-PT` once telemetry + design blockers clear.
- **Immediate ask for manager:** Secure responses from product (launch date) and design (annotated overlays). Without those, marketing cannot lock distribution timing or hand copy to engineering, and enablement’s dry-run prep remains partially blocked.

## 2025-10-11 Data Restart Update
- Data agent confirmed clean worktree and logged restart acknowledgment (`feedback/data.md` 2025-10-11 entry); no stash required.
- Supabase analyzer CLI now live (`npm run ops:analyze-supabase`) with sample summary in `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`; ready once reliability drops the full NDJSON export.
- Shopify metrics backlog tracker created (`docs/data/shopify_metrics_backlog.md`) to keep activation/SLA/anomaly deliverables aligned for launch reporting.

## 2025-10-11 Data Coordination Status (13:45 UTC)
- Analyzer executed on the latest sample bundle (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_sample.ndjson`); preliminary results logged in `docs/insights/2025-10-09_supabase_decision_sync.md` showing 25% timeout rate with `ETIMEDOUT` outlier. Full rerun blocked until reliability supplies the refreshed NDJSON export + staging `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` post-migration.
- Enablement evidence prep drafted (`docs/enablement/shopify_admin_testing_fact_ids.md`) covering fact capture checklist, screenshot paths, and telemetry parity steps. Fact IDs/screenshots remain pending because staging Prisma + UI access is still locked behind the same migration.
- Telemetry parity (`npm run ops:check-analytics-parity`) cannot complete end-to-end without Supabase credentials; data agent ready to execute once secrets land. Request for delivery reiterated in `feedback/data.md` and coordination logs.
- Next actions queued: rerun analyzer + notebook the moment reliability finishes the migration handoff, populate fact IDs for enablement/QA dry run, and push updated evidence bundle into the manager status once artifacts arrive.
- Staging DSN now available (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env` + GitHub staging env); waiting on reliability to run the facts migration and drop the refreshed NDJSON export so data can execute the rerun sequence (analyzer → notebook charts → anomaly log).
- Current blockers: no confirmation yet that the Supabase `facts` migration finished, and the updated NDJSON bundle/export path has not been shared. Data agent is on standby to process immediately upon handoff; escalation logged in coordination files.
- Risk callout: without the fresh export, we cannot verify whether timeout rate/p95 latency has improved post-migration. Recommend reliability prioritize the drop so activation/SLA launch packets aren’t delayed.
- Pending evidence targets once export lands: regenerate `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`, update anomaly flags (timeout rate, p95 latency, retry depth) in `docs/insights/2025-10-09_supabase_decision_sync.md`, and mirror summary in `feedback/data.md` for cross-role visibility.
- Staging DSN now available (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env` + GitHub staging env); waiting on reliability to run the facts migration and drop the refreshed NDJSON export so data can execute the rerun sequence (analyzer → notebook charts → anomaly log).
- Current blockers: no confirmation yet that the Supabase `facts` migration finished, and the updated NDJSON bundle/export path has not been shared. Data agent is on standby to process immediately upon handoff; escalation logged in coordination files.
- Risk callout: without the fresh export, we cannot verify whether timeout rate p95 latency has improved post-migration. Recommend reliability prioritize the drop so activation/SLA launch packets aren’t delayed.

## QA Coverage Pulse
- `npm run test:unit` (12 files, 30 tests) — PASS. Synthetic check harness restored (`scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs`), no module resolution errors.
- `npm run test:e2e` — PASS; targeted check `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Heading"` also PASS after renaming dashboard spec to cover headings explicitly (`tests/playwright/dashboard.spec.ts:6`).
- `bash scripts/qa/test-migration-rollback.sh` — PASS; log archived at `artifacts/qa/migration-test-20251009-070236.log`, no Prisma permission warnings.

## Overnight Backlog Tracking
- Reviewed overnight backlog bullets in `docs/directions/ai.md`, `docs/directions/marketing.md`, `docs/directions/data.md`, and `docs/directions/manager.md`; confirmed owners are still aligned and logged follow-ups in their feedback files.
- AI block: Supabase telemetry still waiting on reliability secrets; noted in `feedback/ai.md` for escalation.
- Marketing actions staged pending staging credential bundle; captured in `docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md` and `feedback/marketing.md`.
- Data awaiting Supabase NDJSON export + GA MCP credential ETA; analyzer tooling (`scripts/ops/analyze-supabase-logs.ts`) on deck.
- Manager backlog items (risk register, Playwright gate, secrets posture) refreshed for leadership sync.

## Direction/Compliance Checks
- Re-read `docs/directions/manager.md` (last_reviewed: 2025-10-06) to reconfirm sprint focus (secrets posture, Playwright heading gate, operator dry run).
- Verified current branch `agent/engineer/dashboard-refresh-telemetry2` complies with `agent/<agent>/<molecule>` naming.
- Reviewed `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic_check_log_2025-10-09.md`; staging URL still missing — pinged reliability/deployment with noon ET deadline.
- Secrets posture: Supabase/Zoho rotations still outstanding; scheduled follow-up escalation at 12:00 ET.

## Immediate Actions
1. Push reliability for Supabase service key + NDJSON export; unblock parity script and AI/data backlog.
2. Sync with product/support on 2025-10-16 dry run slot, staging credential bundle, and visual overlays.
3. Confirm Playwright/Vitest/Lighthouse evidence attached to all active PRs before approval.
# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-09

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Reconfirmed manager sprint focus (role alignment, secrets posture, Playwright regression gate, operator dry run coordination) per `docs/directions/manager.md`.
- Blocked: currently executing integrations workload and lack capacity/authority to drive full manager program; maintaining visibility through integration status updates while requesting dedicated manager support.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
## 2025-10-09 Cross-role Signals
- Updated every role feedback log with sprint kickoff entries; alignment verified, but multiple teams remain blocked by missing Supabase credentials/log exports and staging access packages.
- Designer, deployment, enablement, and reliability queues are still covered by integrations duties; need reassignment or capacity relief to keep sprint focus moving.
- QA to confirm retention plan for AI regression artifacts; decision pending before automation can target final storage path.
- Awaiting responses from reliability (Supabase secrets + monitor assets), QA (artifact storage), enablement/support/product (2025-10-16 dry run logistics), and infra (OCC-INF-221 GA MCP credentials); following up tomorrow if no updates.

- Cross-referenced each role’s updated direction log to ensure sprint focus work started; flagged outstanding blockers (monitoring assets, credentials) for follow-up.
- Coordinated escalation paths with reliability/data around Supabase monitoring/log export to keep mitigation thread moving; awaiting their updates before clearing OCC-212.
- Drafted notes for secrets posture check-in covering Supabase/Zoho rotation status so once reliability delivers plan it can be reviewed immediately.
- Logged daily sprint execution snippets across all role feedback files so progress and blockers are captured consistently; primary blockers remain Supabase monitor assets/log export, staging credential delivery, and launch window confirmation.
- Catalogued tangible outputs from each role’s kickoff (AI samples, compliance follow-up log, data insight scaffold, deployment pipeline review, designer annotations, engineer triage checklist, integrations readiness dashboard, QA Playwright plan, reliability synthetic check log) so manager sync can reference work underway without reopening each repo path.
- Enablement reported English-only audit completion, published Sales Pulse + CX Escalations modal job aids, and pinged product/support (14:35–14:36 ET) to lock the 2025-10-16 dry run agenda; design looped in for annotated visuals. Tracking responses due 2025-10-09 EOD; no replies yet as of 19:45 ET.
- 18:20 ET: preparing to push committed updates; still waiting on product/enablement staging access reply and reliability Supabase credential ETA before closing blockers.
- Filed the Supabase tabletop template (`docs/compliance/evidence/tabletop_supabase_scenario.md`) and the 2025-10-09 vendor follow-up log so compliance can capture drill evidence + DPA outreach as soon as responses land.
- 19:50 ET: Logged integrations prep work (GA MCP sync placeholder, reliability agenda, Hootsuite evidence scaffolding) and cross-linked blockers so manager/infra can act quickly once the 18:30 UTC sync wraps (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`, `docs/integrations/reliability_monitoring_agenda.md`, `artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/`).

## Deployment Push Status — 2025-10-09
- 10:15 ET: Attempted to push deployment updates (staging playbook + feedback log). Remote rejected (`non-fast-forward`). Holding local branch without pulling—awaiting manager guidance on reconciling with upstream and keeping local evidence intact.

## Deployment Status — 2025-10-10
- Blocked: repo still carries cross-role edits (`git status` showing staged/unstaged changes in feedback logs), preventing deployment from branching off `origin/main` per git protocol. Requested responsible agents to stash/land their work so deployment can proceed.
- Re-read refreshed deployment direction (2025-10-08 sprint focus) and executing production blockers per today’s directive.
- Authored QA rollback drill checklist in `docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md` so QA can exercise migrations once staging credentials land.
- Created `docs/deployment/environment_check_template.md` and updated `docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md` to require env-check evidence + rollback drill before approvals.
- Outstanding: reliability still owes GitHub `production` secrets (Shopify/Supabase/Chatwoot/Anthropic/GA), staging Postgres connection strings, and Shopify service credentials; repo admins still need to enforce environment reviewers.
- Next once secrets arrive: run `scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh`, attach log using new template, coordinate QA rollback drill, and prep production dry-run dispatch.

## 2025-10-10 Production Blocker Sweep
- Supabase fix: reliability/engineering/data still waiting on monitor script + log export; keeping OCC-212 elevated and chasing owners for delivery times today.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: deployment + reliability coordinating on GitHub environment secrets and Postgres credentials; expect follow-up this afternoon to unblock QA/deployment tasks.
- GA MCP readiness: integrations pinged infra/compliance for OCC-INF-221 credential timeline; product/data remain blocked pending response.
- Operator dry run: enablement/support awaiting staging access confirmation and annotated visuals before invites go out; marketing standing by with training script.
- Integrations prepped monitoring agenda action log and Hootsuite evidence scaffolding; awaiting HS-44721 doc (ETA 12:00 UTC tomorrow) and OCC-INF-221 (infra on-call promised update by 22:00 UTC).
- Compliance ready to ingest vendor packet + GA MCP evidence within one hour of receipt; integrations coordinating handoffs.

## 2025-10-08 — Sprint Focus Activation
- Cross-checked each role’s sprint focus against current feedback entries and logged coordination pings to keep deliverables aligned per `docs/directions/manager.md:24`.
- Opened thread with reliability to track Supabase/Zoho secret rotation schedule, supporting `docs/directions/manager.md:25`; awaiting their confirmed calendar.
- Reminded engineers to keep Playwright heading regression block in effect until new evidence bundle (Vitest + Playwright + Lighthouse) is attached per `docs/directions/manager.md:26`.
- Partnering with product/support/enablement to finalize the 2025-10-16 operator dry run logistics and ensure outcomes feed into Memory (`scope="ops"`) per `docs/directions/manager.md:27`.

## AI Escalations Update — 2025-10-09
- Direction refresh acknowledged; AI agent aligned on sprint focus (dry-run kit samples, daily regression hygiene, pilot readiness brief).
- Dry-run kit prep underway: drafting annotated CX escalation copy + sales pulse variants for docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/; regression artifacts now emitted under artifacts/ai/ for QA handoff.
- Blockers: Supabase credentials (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) still pending so decision logs persist beyond in-memory fallback; QA storage target for prompt regression artifacts TBD; `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS` remains off pending those inputs.
- Requests: 1) Manager to chase reliability for Supabase secrets + confirm storage plan with QA, 2) advise on long-term artifact retention owner, 3) green-light timeline for enabling `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS` once dependencies land.
- Next actions: maintain daily `npm run ai:regression` cadence with qualitative notes in feedback/ai.md; finalize pilot readiness brief with guardrails + go/no-go criteria for product/compliance review.


## Support / CX Escalations Update — 2025-10-09
- Direction refresh acknowledged; support aligned on sprint focus (CX Escalations modal validation, English-only collateral upkeep, dry run logistics).
- Preparing updated runbook screenshots once staging seed is ready; English-only template review cadence continues.
- Blocked on product confirmation of the 2025-10-16 dry run slot and staging access needed for validation evidence.
- Awaiting seeded conversations to regression-test Chatwoot heuristics beyond current unit coverage.
- 10:45 ET: pinged product + enablement on Slack requesting dry-run confirmation and staging access ETA; awaiting response.
- Expanded shipping/refund keyword coverage in Chatwoot heuristics and added regression tests to cover fallback + tag-only scenarios (run: `npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/chatwoot.escalations.spec.ts`).
- Added Pending Validation checklist to `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md` so staging evidence can be captured immediately after access is restored.

## Integrations Status — 2025-10-09
- GA MCP credentials still blocked on OCC-INF-221; manager/infra sync at 18:30 UTC remains the decision point for host + secret ETA. Onboarding checklist in `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md` ready for immediate update once results land.
- Reliability monitoring sync agenda drafted with provisional Hootsuite vs native API rate-limit thresholds; HS-44721 doc needed to finalize and circulate ahead of the 17:00 UTC meeting (`docs/integrations/reliability_monitoring_agenda.md`).
- Hootsuite compliance packet evidence remains placeholders (`artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/`); waiting on order form, SLA addendum, and security questionnaire before the 16:00 UTC DPIA review.
- Upcoming actions and blockers tracked in `feedback/integrations.md`; poised to log infra outcome, drop vendor artifacts, and publish final monitoring thresholds upon receipt.

## Marketing Update — 2025-10-09
- Launch comms packet updated with approval tracker and character-count guardrails for banner/email/blog so product can sign off on English-only copy without rework (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`).
- New support training script drafted for the 2025-10-16 dry run; aligns walkthrough with FAQ and flags pending staging credentials (`docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md`).
- Launch timeline playbook published with relative T- milestones, KPIs, and risk matrix pending product launch date (`docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md`).
- Awaiting product launch window confirmation (blocks calendar locking) and design tooltip annotations (due Oct 8 @ 12:00 ET). Localization ask paused per manager direction unless product reopens multi-language scope.
- Ask: Can marketing drive the support training invite cadence directly, or should enablement own scheduling once slots are confirmed?
- 20:25 ET: Followed up with product (Slack thread #occ-launch) referencing the launch timeline playbook impact on ESP scheduling; no response yet, will escalate if quiet by tomorrow 10:00 ET.
- 20:27 ET: Nudged designer for tooltip placement annotations (referenced `docs/marketing/tooltip_placement_request_2025-10-07.md`); they confirmed delivery first thing tomorrow and will tag marketing once uploaded.
- Supabase telemetry credentials still outstanding; marketing highlighted dependency in KPI table and will refresh comms evidence as soon as reliability shares secrets.
- GA MCP readiness remains blocked on OCC-INF-221; marketing standing by to update comms metadata once integrations confirms host/credential ETA.

## Deployment Pipeline Status — 2025-10-09
- Re-read the refreshed deployment direction (`docs/directions/deployment.md`, sprint focus 2025-10-08) and confirmed our deliverables: staging pipeline, env matrix, prod go-live checklist, and Postgres staging configuration.
- Staging deployment workflow remains healthy (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`) and continues to gate on smoke/Lighthouse artifacts via `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`; runbook guidance is live in `docs/runbooks/deployment_staging.md` for operator dry runs.
- Production workflow draft (`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`) and CLI wrapper (`scripts/deploy/production-deploy.sh`) are ready, but we cannot schedule a rehearsal until GitHub `production` environment secrets and reviewers are configured.
- Environment + secrets matrix (`docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`) and go-live checklist (`docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md`) remain current; no delta from reliability yet on the pending secret rows.
- Postgres-backed staging/test database provisioning plan is documented (`docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md`, `prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`) but still waiting on reliability to wire credentials so QA can begin migration rollback drills.
- Authored `docs/deployment/production_environment_setup.md` covering vault provisioning, `gh` secret automation, Shopify CLI token generation, and required reviewer configuration; circulating to reliability + repo admins today.
- Added `scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh` so we can automatically verify GitHub environment coverage once reliability confirms secrets.
- 09:40 ET: Shared the playbook + checker with reliability and repo admins; awaiting acknowledgment plus vault references for production secrets and staged Postgres credentials.

## Compliance Update — 2025-10-09
- Direction refresh acknowledged; sprint focus remains data inventory upkeep, Supabase incident readiness, and vendor DPA audit (see `feedback/compliance.md` 2025-10-09 entry).
- Supabase incident runbook published (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`) with companion tabletop template drafted at `docs/compliance/evidence/tabletop_supabase_scenario.md`; awaiting reliability/support confirmation on scenario scope and drill date.
- Retention automation blocked on reliability deploying Supabase `pg_cron` jobs and sharing first-run logs; follow-up booked for 2025-10-10 14:00 ET, evidence to land under `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/`.
- Vendor DPAs/residency attestations still pending for GA MCP, Supabase, Anthropic (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`); documented reminder cadence in `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-09.md` and escalated today via `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-10.md` with manager CC.
- Coordinated with deployment on outstanding staging Postgres + production secret requirements (`docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`); compliance review ready once reliability supplies vault paths and smoke evidence.
- Operator dry run compliance content (privacy notice + FAQ references) re-validated for the 2025-10-16 session; awaiting enablement/product confirmation on agenda and staging access before attaching final talking points.
- Requests: 1) Manager to escalate vendor legal contacts for signed DPAs/residency statements, 2) Reliability to prioritize cron rollout + deliver logs, 3) Support to confirm tabletop participation so we can lock drill date.

### Outstanding Dependencies
1. Reliability to load Shopify, Supabase, and smoke test secrets into the GitHub `production` environment and document vault paths in `feedback/reliability.md` (refs `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md` rows 73-101).
2. Repo admins to enforce manager + reliability as required reviewers on the GitHub `production` environment so the workflow matches the go-live checklist.
3. Shopify service account credentials to generate `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_PROD` and unblock the final GitHub secret population.

### Upcoming Actions
- Share the production environment setup playbook with reliability + repo admins and capture sign-off on owners/dates.
- Track reliability handoff and, once secrets land, validate the production smoke target + update the env matrix status column.
- Coordinate with repo admins to flip on environment reviewers and document the approval flow in the go-live checklist.
- Run the new `scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh` after provisioning to confirm coverage and attach the output to `feedback/deployment.md`.
- Stage the Shopify CLI token generation steps so we can populate the secret immediately after credentials arrive, then schedule a dry-run dispatch.
- Draft env-check output template + QA rollback handoff notes so we can publish the results immediately when secrets land.
- Escalate if reliability/admin ETAs slip beyond 2025-10-09; otherwise continue async logging in `feedback/deployment.md`.
- Confirmed push health; ready to resume deployment evidence logging once reliability delivers the pending secrets.

# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-08

## Deployment Pipeline Status — 2025-10-08
- **Staging pipeline online:** Added `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` with verify → deploy jobs and Shopify CLI orchestration via `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`, emitting Playwright, Lighthouse, and synthetic smoke artifacts. Documentation captured in `docs/runbooks/deployment_staging.md` (overview references production hand-off).
- **Production workflow drafted:** `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` enforces manual dispatch with release tag, go-live checklist link, and manager/reliability approvers; wraps `scripts/deploy/production-deploy.sh` plus Lighthouse + smoke evidence.
- **Readiness docs published:** Environment matrix now tracks prod secret provisioning and smoke budgets (`docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`), and go-live checklist aligns with the new workflow inputs and performance targets (`docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md`).
- **Status log updated:** `feedback/deployment.md` reflects direction acknowledgement, shipped artifacts, outstanding risks, and next actions.
- **Outstanding needs:** Reliability to populate GitHub `production` environment secrets by 2025-10-09, repo admins to set environment reviewers, deployment to generate service Shopify CLI token once creds land (see follow-ups in env matrix + deployment log).

## Engineer Direction Sync — 2025-10-08
- Engineer acknowledged the refreshed docs/directions/engineer.md focus (Supabase sync remediation, Postgres staging enablement, modal polish, telemetry wiring).
- Action: Added `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` and wired parity script guidance so data/reliability can create the Supabase `facts` table without guesswork; reran `npm run ops:check-analytics-parity` and logged the `supabase.facts_table_missing` event (`artifacts/logs/supabase_parity_run_2025-10-10.json`) while we wait for reliability to execute the SQL.
- Status: Feature flag module restored (`app/config/featureFlags.ts`) with unit coverage; targeted `npm run test:unit` specs now pass.
- Status: Lighthouse runner now consumes `LIGHTHOUSE_TARGET` or `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL`; awaiting staging secret hookup to resume evidence uploads.

## AI Escalation Enablement — Outstanding Requirements
- **Supabase credentials:** `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` are still unset on the AI workstation. `getSupabaseConfig()` now loads `.env`, but without real values decision logs remain in the in-memory fallback and never sync to Supabase/Memory MCP. Requesting staging (or prod-ready) credentials so we can validate persistence before the M1 dry run.
- **QA artifact storage:** Prompt regression now auto-writes JSON artifacts to `artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-<timestamp>.json`. QA needs the canonical destination for bundling these with Playwright evidence. Please confirm if we keep them under `artifacts/ai/` in repo, publish to an external bucket, or adjust CI to collect them.
- **Kill switch coordination:** `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS` defaults to `0`. Turn it on per environment (`FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS=1`) once Supabase logging is active and QA has the artifact flow in place; otherwise the modal ships template-only.

## Compliance Update — 2025-10-08
- **Direction ack:** Re-read `docs/directions/compliance.md`; sprint focus confirmed (data inventory refresh, Supabase incident response, vendor DPA audit). Logged acknowledgement + blockers in `feedback/compliance.md`.
- **Artifacts live:** Data inventory + retention plan refreshed (`docs/compliance/data_inventory.md`, `docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md`). New Supabase incident runbook drafted (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`); needs reliability + support review prior to tabletop scheduling.
- **Evidence captured:** Vendor outreach + purge evidence stored (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-08.md`, `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/2025-10-08_purge_log.json` placeholder pending cron output). DPIA + notice updates remain current.
- **Open risks:**
  - R2 (Vendor DPAs) — Missing executed agreements + residency attestations for GA MCP, Supabase, Anthropic (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`).
  - R1 (Retention automations) — Supabase `pg_cron` deployment + first-run evidence outstanding; reliability coordination required per `docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md`.
- **Asks:** 1) Manager to secure vendor signatures/responses, 2) Reliability to schedule cron rollout + share logs, 3) Support to validate runbook scope + confirm tabletop participation.

## Support / CX Escalations Update — 2025-10-08
- **Template heuristics shipped:** Chatwoot escalations service now picks `ship_update`, `refund_offer`, or `ack_delay` based on tags/message keywords and renders customer names before approval flows. Unit tests updated to cover the paths (`app/services/chatwoot/escalations.ts`, `tests/unit/chatwoot.escalations.spec.ts`).
- **Label alignment:** Escalation action now tags conversations with `escalation` (was `escalated`) to match SOP terminology and runbook guidance (`app/routes/actions/chatwoot.escalate.ts`).
- **Runbook refresh:** Added annotated modal screenshots, approval heuristics, greeting checks, and validation notes so operators train against the live flow (`docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md`).
- **Outstanding items:** Product still owes confirmation on the 2025-10-16 dry run (`docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`). French template localization declared out-of-scope; localization cadence paused unless requirements change.
- **Risks:** Heuristics rely on simple keyword detection; needs real-conversation validation post-staging seed. Modal still lacks template editing—operators must escalate when suggestions misfit.

## Data Update — 2025-10-08
- Direction refresh acknowledged in `feedback/data.md`; sprint focus locked on Supabase decision sync reliability, weekly insight addendum, and GA MCP readiness.
- Supabase spike investigation: instrumentation diff ready, but blocked until reliability provides Supabase retry/error logs plus a valid `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to reproduce the 25% failure rate in staging. Tracking alongside reliability pairing request.
- Weekly insight addendum: narrative outline drafted; waiting on tonight's activation/SLA ETL to populate charts prior to attaching notebook links in `docs/insights/` by 2025-10-09 noon ET.
- GA MCP readiness: coordination brief issued (`feedback/data_to_integrations_coordination.md`), pending integrations/compliance to confirm credential handoff window before executing `docs/data/ga_mcp_go_live_checklist.md` Step 1 parity checks.
- Follow-ups sent 2025-10-08 to reliability (Supabase logs + service key) and integrations/compliance (credential ETA + evidence acknowledgment); escalation windows set for 19:00/20:00 UTC respectively if no response (`feedback/data_to_reliability_coordination.md`, `feedback/data_to_integrations_coordination.md`).
- Escalations triggered to manager/reliability and manager/integrations/compliance requesting immediate delivery of Supabase artifacts and GA MCP credential plan; awaiting responses to unblock readiness workstreams.

## Cross-Role Check-in — 2025-10-09
- AI/Data/Engineer streams paused pending reliability’s Supabase log export and staging `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`; escalations logged with 2025-10-09 deadlines for delivery (`feedback/data_to_reliability_coordination.md`).
- GA MCP credential ETA and compliance acknowledgment still outstanding after escalation; integrations to report OCC-INF-221 outcome before EOD so parity checklist can proceed (`feedback/data_to_integrations_coordination.md`).
- Designer ready with static component handoff/tooltip annotations once Figma access and staging screenshots land; enablement awaiting assets for job aids.
- Deployment workflows prepped but production rehearsal blocked on GitHub `production` secrets and reviewer gating; playbook delivered to reliability/admin for action.
- QA/Support/Enablement/Marketing logs refreshed; each waiting on upstream signals (staging seeds, launch window, dry run confirmations) to close sprint deliverables.

# Manager Daily Status — 2025-10-07

- Refresh sprint focus in `docs/directions/ai.md`, `docs/directions/data.md`, `docs/directions/designer.md`, `docs/directions/engineer.md`, `docs/directions/marketing.md`, `docs/directions/product.md`, `docs/directions/qa.md`, `docs/directions/reliability.md`, and `docs/directions/support.md` to align with the M1/M2 check-in and the English-only scope.
- Added direction coverage for Compliance, Deployment, Integrations, and Enablement (`docs/directions/compliance.md`, `docs/directions/deployment.md`, `docs/directions/integrations.md`, `docs/directions/enablement.md`) so every role has current marching orders.
- Updated AI and QA sprint focus (2025-10-08) to reflect regression evidence sharing, Supabase logging dependencies, and dry-run preparation.
- Strengthened git workflow guidance in `docs/git_protocol.md` and `docs/directions/README.md`; agents must follow the fetch/rebase/push steps and work from their own branches without waiting for additional approval.
- All agents must review the updated direction doc for their role, acknowledge in their feedback log today, and raise blockers ahead of the 2025-10-08 sync.
- Reminder: Manager direction updates now land in `feedback/manager.md`. When you need the latest assignments or sprint focus, check this file first.

## Summary
- Playwright gate is green again (21/21 unit tests, 7/7 Playwright) after the engineer landed the accessible heading and modal flows; reliability confirms CI stability.
- CX Escalations and Sales Pulse modals plus Supabase Memory analytics logging are live, unlocking QA coverage and operator dry-run prep.
- Data delivered the first weekly insight packet and Supabase monitoring brief; reliability staged synthetic checks and artifact retention.
- Data insight highlights for operator readiness: Sales activation dipped 30% vs. baseline (critical anomaly) per `docs/insights/weekly_2025-10-07.md:31`, Chatwoot SLA breach rate holding at 50% warning per `docs/insights/weekly_2025-10-07.md:75`, and GA traffic anomaly alerts flag `/blogs/news/october-launch` at -27% WoW per `docs/insights/weekly_2025-10-07.md:100` — prep follow-up playbooks before live swap.
- Demo shop seeds now cover Evergreen Outfitters, Belle Maison Décor, and Peak Performance Gear via `npm run seed` (multi-domain support in `prisma/seeds/dashboard-facts.seed.ts:1`), and GA MCP parity harness (`scripts/analytics/ga-mcp-schema-check.ts:1`) plus baseline artifact `artifacts/ga/mock_schema.json:1` are ready for credential hand-off to integrations/compliance.
- Coordination brief issued to integrations & compliance (`feedback/data_to_integrations_coordination.md:1`) capturing the T0 go-live window (seed run, parity check, Supabase alert verification) so credential delivery can move directly into checklist execution.
- AI prompt regression and logging services are ready; awaiting go/no-go on live generation pending M1/M2 alignment.

## Blockers / Risks
- Supabase decision sync monitor now wired to real logs; first run showed **25% error rate (critical)** — reliability + data need root cause and mitigation.
- GA MCP credentials still pending, keeping analytics in mock mode.
- Designer remains blocked on Figma workspace access, delaying the shared component library.

## Actions & Assignments
- **Engineer**: Resolve the Supabase decision sync failures with data/reliability collaboration, bring up the Postgres staging configuration for QA, finish accessibility polish on CX Escalations/Sales Pulse modals, and rerun Vitest/Playwright/Lighthouse with artifacts attached.
- **Designer**: Deliver the shared component library (or static handoff) with status icon assets, annotate tooltip/focus flows for engineering, and supply visuals for enablement’s CX Escalations/Sales Pulse job aids.
- **QA**: Extend Playwright coverage to modal approval flows (including AI suggestion states), validate migrations on SQLite + staging Postgres when deployment provides access, verify Supabase logging outputs with AI/reliability, and log the combined evidence bundle in `feedback/qa.md`.
- **Data**: Lead the Supabase incident analysis (root cause + instrumentation), publish the 2025-10-09 insight addendum covering activation/SLA/anomaly trends, and finalize GA MCP readiness materials for integrations/compliance handoff.
- **Reliability**: Drive Supabase mitigation and alert automation, run the synthetic check workflow daily with logged metrics, and ship the 2025-10-10 secret rotation plan while prepping prerequisites for the Week 3 backup drill.
- **AI**: Assemble the operator dry-run AI kit (annotated suggestions stored under enablement), keep regression artifacts flowing to QA, and finalize the pilot readiness brief with guardrails/killswitch details before the M1/M2 checkpoint.
- **Marketing**: Lock English-only launch comms with product sign-off, hand the operator FAQ/training script to enablement/support, and publish the launch timeline playbook with KPI checkpoints.
- **Product**: Refresh the Linear backlog with Supabase/dry-run/telemetry work, assign metric owners, and finalize the 2025-10-16 operator dry run plan with enablement/support, logging decisions in Memory (scope `ops`).
- **Support**: Update runbooks/templates for English-only messaging, validate the live modal workflows against SOPs, and coordinate dry run logistics with enablement/product (Q&A captured).
- **Enablement** (Marie Dubois): Audit training materials for localization remnants, produce Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids, and own operator dry run logistics; track progress in `feedback/enablement.md`.
- **Compliance** (Casey Lin): Publish the OCC data inventory, author the Supabase incident response runbook with reliability/support input, and summarize vendor agreement follow-ups in `feedback/compliance.md`.
- **Deployment** (Devon Ortiz): Stand up the staging pipeline, provision the Postgres test database, document the environment/secrets matrix, and draft the production go-live checklist with rollback gates.
- **Integrations** (Priya Singh): Secure GA MCP credentials or documented ETA, recommend the social sentiment vendor path with marketing/reliability, and share the integration readiness dashboard before the checkpoint.

- Session tracking foundation for analytics

## Designer Sprint Update (2025-10-06)

### Completed Deliverables
1. **Design QA Report** (feedback/design_qa_report.md)
   - Validated engineer's tile implementation: PASS (100% token compliance)
   - Identified P0 accessibility issues (ARIA attributes, focus indicators needed)
   - Provided actionable recommendations

2. **High-Fidelity Modal Layouts** (docs/design/wireframes/modal_layouts.md)
   - CX Escalation, Inventory Alert, SEO Anomaly modals
   - All states: default, loading, success, error, empty
   - Complete CSS implementation + ARIA markup
   - Focus trap TypeScript code
   - Responsive behavior specifications

3. **Copy Deck - Modals (English-only)** (docs/design/copy_deck_modals.md)
   - 100+ modal/toast strings (EN)
   - Character count analysis + layout warnings
   - Responsive button text strategy

### Sprint Status: 75% Complete (3/4 goals)
- ✓ Paired with engineer on tile demo
- ✓ Delivered modal layouts
- ✓ Provided copy updates with layout flags
- ⏳ Figma library (blocked on workspace access)

### Key Findings
- **Token integration:** Excellent (no hardcoded values)
- **P0 accessibility gaps:** ARIA attributes, focus indicators, status icons
- **Button label overflow:** Identified several long-form phrases that need shortening for mobile
- **Modal implementation:** Estimated 3-5 day effort (recommend phased approach)

### Designer Recommendations
1. Prioritize P0 modals (CX Escalation + toasts) for M2
2. Budget for external a11y audit after M2 or provide NVDA training

## Next Actions
- Engineer: Implement P0 accessibility fixes (ARIA, focus indicators, status icons)
- Engineer: Begin CX Escalation modal + toast system (prioritize over all 3 modals)
- Designer: Support modal implementation (pairing session recommended)
- Designer: Create Figma library (when workspace access granted)
- QA: Define test cases based on accessibility criteria + modal states
- QA: Validate design token implementation against tokens.css
- Product: Review copy deck for tone and confirm English-only messaging

## Engineering Status — 2025-10-08

### Completed
- TileCard now exposes focusable `<article>` regions with `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby`, polite timestamp announcements, and status icons (app/components/tiles/TileCard.tsx#L62).
- Added dashboard-level manual refresh control calling `/app/actions/dashboard.refresh`, with aria-live status messaging and loader revalidation (app/routes/app._index.tsx#L44, app/routes/actions/dashboard.refresh.ts#L24).
- Persisted refresh triggers to Prisma facts and mirrored to Supabase with structured latency/error logs covering view/refresh/get operations (app/routes/actions/dashboard.refresh.ts#L24, app/services/analytics.server.ts#L22).
- Authored analytics parity script comparing Prisma vs Supabase counts and exposed npm script (`npm run ops:check-analytics-parity`) for Ops hand-off (scripts/ops/check-dashboard-analytics-parity.ts#L1, package.json#L18).
- Delivered Postgres staging/test database scaffolding: new Prisma schema + npm helpers (`prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`, `db:*:postgres` scripts), `.env.staging.example`, and runbook (`docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md`) with environment matrix cross-link.

### Evidence
- Vitest: `npm run test:unit` → blocked by missing `app/config/featureFlags.ts` import in existing chatwoot specs (pre-existing repo gap).
- Targeted Vitest: `npx vitest run tests/unit/supabase.config.spec.ts` ✅
- Playwright: `npm run test:e2e` (7/7 green)
- Parity probe: `npm run ops:check-analytics-parity` → highlights Supabase unconfigured locally (requires credentials)
- Lighthouse: still gated by missing `LIGHTHOUSE_TARGET`; script exits early pending target definition

### Blockers / Requests
- Need `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` for parity check to validate counts (<1% delta) before sign-off.
- Require confirmed Lighthouse target URL to regenerate accessibility/perf artifact for the evidence bundle.

## Marketing Update — 2025-10-07
- Finalized launch comms copy per product approvals (banner/email/blog, EN & FR) and documented decisions in `docs/marketing/product_approval_packet_2025-10-07.md`.
- Updated tooltip handoff + localization request; awaiting design annotations (due Oct 8 @ 12:00 ET) and FR review (due Oct 9 @ 18:00 ET).
- Published October campaign calendar with KPI targets; holding distribution scheduling until product locks launch date tomorrow.

## Marketing Update — 2025-10-07 (EOD)
- Launch comms now match product-approved copy (banner/email/blog/tooltip) with FR variants captured for localization confirmation.
- Tooltip placement pending designer annotations (due Oct 8 @ 12:00 ET); localization reviewing "Centre OCC" abbreviation by Oct 9.
- Campaign calendar drafted with KPI targets and will be locked once product confirms launch date tomorrow.

## Compliance Update — 2025-10-08 (Detailed)
- **Deliverables completed**
  - Data inventory & retention matrix (`docs/compliance/data_inventory.md`) documenting flows across Shopify, Chatwoot, Supabase, GA MCP, Anthropic, caches, and forthcoming Hootsuite tile with retention targets/classifications.
  - Incident response runbook for breach scenarios (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_breach.md`) covering detection → notification → recovery with GDPR/CCPA compliance and evidence handling.
  - Retention automation plan + tooling (`docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md`, new purge script `scripts/ops/purge-dashboard-data.ts`, npm task `npm run ops:purge-dashboard-data`). Baseline run output archived at `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/2025-10-08_purge_log.json`; Supabase cron SQL draft ready (`docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/retention/cron_setup.sql`).
  - DPIA for Chatwoot transcripts & Anthropic prompts (`docs/compliance/dpia_chatwoot_anthropic.md`) with mitigation requirements (prompt sanitizer, opt-out toggle, vendor DPAs).
  - Privacy notice alignment: update deck (`docs/compliance/privacy_notice_updates.md`), launch FAQ disclosures (`docs/marketing/launch_faq.md`), rollout plan (`docs/marketing/privacy_toggle_rollout.md`), and publication-ready notice copy (`docs/compliance/evidence/privacy_notice/operator_notice_v2025-10-08.md`).
- **Vendor contracts & evidence tracking**
  - Request templates + status tracker published (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_requests.md`, `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`).
  - Initial outreach logged for GA MCP, Supabase, Anthropic (2025-10-07) with follow-ups recorded 2025-10-08 (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-08.md`). Awaiting ticket numbers—need escalation if no replies by 2025-10-10.
- **Blockers needing manager support**
  1. Vendor DPAs absent → production launch blocked until documents archived in evidence folders.
  2. Analytics opt-out toggle + AI prompt sanitizer unbuilt; both are prerequisites from DPIA before enabling GA MCP or Anthropic in production.
  3. Supabase retention cron deployment pending reliability resourcing; without it we rely on manual purge script runs.
- **Action requests**
  - Push vendors/partners for DPA packages and residency assurances.
  - Prioritize engineering work on opt-out toggle (Settings → Privacy) and prompt sanitizer this sprint.
  - Coordinate reliability to implement Supabase pg_cron jobs using provided SQL and capture first-run evidence.
- **Upcoming deadlines**
  - 2025-10-12: Publish privacy notice + opt-out messaging, update support documentation.
  - 2025-10-14: Retention automations operational and vendor DPAs on file (see R1/R2 in `feedback/compliance.md`).
  - 2025-10-16: Re-run DPIA after mitigations for Anthropic go-live decision.

## Compliance Escalation — 2025-10-11
- **Supabase SCC & Evidence**
  - Follow-up sent 2025-10-11 requesting countersigned SCC bundle, explicit region confirmation (`us-east-1`), and delivery ETA for pg_cron evidence (first-run logs + rotation proof). Ticket still unacknowledged; please escalate via exec contact or vendor Slack bridge if silence continues past 2025-10-13 15:00 UTC.
  - Incident response runbook refreshed with credential handoff checkpoints, restart stash requirements, and evidence paths (see `docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`). Restart-cycle stash proof archived at `docs/compliance/evidence/restart_cycles/2025-10-11_restart_cycle.md`.
- **Shopify DPA**
  - Shopify Data Processing Addendum + subprocessor snapshot captured 2025-10-11; SHA256 fingerprints logged. Evidence and review summary stored under `docs/compliance/evidence/shopify/`. Ready for legal spot-check, no blocker.
- **Operator Comms**
  - Verified marketing/support materials already mention privacy toggles + Supabase logging. Awaiting written sign-off from marketing (launch comms) and support (playbooks). Once confirmations land, will log in `feedback/compliance.md` and mark sprint focus item complete.
- **Next Critical Actions**
  1. Supabase escalation if support silent by 2025-10-13 15:00 UTC; goal is countersigned SCC + region statement before M1 checkpoint.
  2. Reliability to share pg_cron first-run evidence; compliance ready to archive in `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/`.
  3. Marketing/support to confirm privacy messaging distribution; compliance will add evidence screenshots to enablement packet.

## Compliance Update — 2025-10-12
- **Direction sync:** Re-read `docs/directions/compliance.md`; sprint bullets (vendor tracker, Supabase incident runbook, operator privacy comms) remain valid. Working the plan—no direction change requested.
- **Delivered today:**
  - Vendor tracker refreshed (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`) with Shopify DPA hash + signature status, and Supabase SCC placeholder staged at `docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/scc/README.md` to document the missing countersign + region confirmation. Latest follow-up logged under `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-11.md`.
  - Supabase incident response runbook updated (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`) to embed credential handoff checkpoints (Slack confirmation capture, env matrix diff, restart stash evidence referencing `docs/compliance/evidence/restart_cycles/2025-10-11_restart_cycle.md`).
  - Launch comms (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`) now include Shopify Admin scope + Supabase telemetry retention note; FAQ (`docs/marketing/launch_faq.md`) and support training script already mention the privacy toggle so no additional edits required.
- **Current status by sprint bullet:**
  1. **Vendor agreements** — Shopify bundle complete; Supabase SCC + region confirmation outstanding; Anthropic + GA MCP still pending vendor responses. Evidence folders ready for attachments.
  2. **Supabase runbook** — Credential handoff + restart evidence wiring complete; awaiting reliability’s pg_cron logs to close loop.
  3. **Operator privacy comms** — Copy updates shipped in canon; waiting on marketing/support to confirm deployment plans.
- **Blockers & deadlines:**
  - Supabase countersigned SCC/region confirmation due 2025-10-14 17:00 UTC; Shopify admin testing stays blocked until received.
  - Marketing/support acknowledgements on privacy messaging outstanding; without written confirmation sprint bullet remains open.
  - Reliability still owes pg_cron first-run evidence; retention automation sign-off depends on their delivery.
- **Evidence & logging:** Daily notes in `feedback/compliance.md` (2025-10-12 entry) reference updated files above; SCC placeholder + runbook patches committed for audit trail.
- **Requests for manager:**
  1. Escalate Supabase ticket via account/vendor channels if no response before the 2025-10-14 deadline; loop compliance so correspondence can be archived.
  2. Ping marketing + support owners for explicit confirmation that refreshed privacy language (email/blog/training) will ship; we’ll capture acknowledgements on receipt.
- **Next steps:** Continue chasing Supabase/legal responses, hash + archive SCC bundle immediately when delivered, log marketing/support confirmations, and keep daily status updated. Ready to supply additional privacy guidance or adjust documentation if new vendor agreements land.
- **Recommended next tasks (pending dependencies):**
  1. Draft Supabase SCC hash register template (`docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/scc/hash_register.md`) so signatures can be logged instantly upon arrival.
  2. Prep privacy messaging confirmation checklist for marketing/support (simple ack template + evidence locations) to accelerate sign-off once they respond.
  3. Outline retention evidence handoff doc for reliability (fields to capture, expected pg_cron log formats) to unblock their delivery.
  4. Begin compiling DPIA addendum shell covering Shopify admin testing once SCC lands, so we can close the sprint quickly.
  5. If time allows, stage GA MCP DPA placeholder folder mirroring the Supabase pattern to keep evidence structure consistent.

## Compliance Update — 2025-10-12 (EOD)
- **Executed today:**
  - Sent privacy comms confirmation requests to marketing/support and logged outreach plus DM snippet (`docs/compliance/evidence/operator_privacy_comms/sent_2025-10-12.md`).
  - Delivered pg_cron evidence follow-up via `#occ-ops`, set 2025-10-13 reminder, and referenced the checklist so reliability knows the artefacts required (`docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/pg_cron_followup_2025-10-12.md`, `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/pg_cron_evidence_checklist.md`).
  - Filled in Supabase escalation draft with ticket #SUP-49213 and calendared the 2025-10-14 send window (`docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/scc/escalation_draft_2025-10-14.md`).
  - Submitted GA MCP follow-up through the support portal; awaiting acknowledgement before the 2025-10-15 escalation (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-12.md`).
  - Refreshed the Shopify Admin testing DPIA addendum so readiness blockers map to pending evidence (`docs/compliance/dpia_shopify_admin_testing_addendum.md`).
- **Current blockers:**
  1. Supabase countersigned SCC + region confirmation still outstanding; escalate if silent at 2025-10-14 17:00 UTC SLA.
  2. Reliability has not yet delivered pg_cron first-run evidence; retention automation closure depends on their artefacts.
  3. Marketing/support confirmations pending; sprint bullet remains open until responses archived.
  4. GA MCP DPA + regional letter not yet supplied; tracking support ticket for ETA.
- **Next actions (owner: compliance):**
  1. Chase marketing/support for confirmations on 2025-10-13 and drop evidence into `docs/compliance/evidence/operator_privacy_comms/`.
  2. Follow up with reliability if evidence folder not posted by 2025-10-13 22:00 UTC; hash artefacts immediately once available.
  3. Fire Supabase escalation at SLA if no progress and notify manager for parallel escalation path.
  4. Log GA MCP ticket response on arrival and archive DPA/residency documents with hashes.
  5. Complete DPIA addendum approvals once outstanding evidence lands.
- **Requests for manager:**
  - Stay ready to escalate Supabase via exec channels on 2025-10-14 if support remains silent; compliance draft is prepared.
  - Nudge marketing/support counterparts if they miss the 2025-10-13 confirmation deadline so sprint bullet can close on schedule.
-## AI Agent Status — 2025-10-10 05:15 UTC
- Daily regression executed 02:50 UTC (`npm run ai:regression` → PASS; BLEU 0.9444 / ROUGE-L 0.9565); artifact `artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-2025-10-10-025007.json` logged in `feedback/ai.md` for QA pickup.
- Dry-run kit docs across CX Escalations, Sales Pulse, and Inventory remain staged with telemetry callouts; awaiting data’s refreshed Supabase NDJSON export to append fact IDs + screenshots without fabricating evidence.
- Fly staging host behaviour: `?mock=1` serves the mock dashboard (HTTP 200), while `?mock=0` still returns HTTP 410; holding rate-limit mitigation notes + staging URL references in enablement packets until deployment/reliability confirm expected live-response contract.
- Direction re-read 2025-10-10 04:20 UTC — no updates; sprint focus unchanged and logged in `feedback/ai.md`.
- Direction refreshed 2025-10-10 05:05 UTC — new requirement to coordinate with engineer/data so prompt regression artifacts include latest decision-log telemetry; plan logged in `feedback/ai.md` pending data’s NDJSON drop.
- Blockers: (1) waiting on data’s NDJSON export + decision-log telemetry to safely append fact IDs/screenshots and extend regression artifacts, (2) waiting on deployment/reliability to resolve `mock=0` HTTP 410 so staging references can ship without stale instructions. Next actions queued once dependencies clear: ingest export, re-verify staging host, update enablement packets + Memory logs, then circulate final dry-run kit to enablement/QA.
- **Recommended next tasks once unblocked:**
  1. Partner with data to ingest the NDJSON export, extract Supabase decision/fact IDs, and wire them into enablement packets plus Memory logging.
  2. Collaborate with engineering to extend `scripts/ai/run-prompt-regression.ts` so regression artifacts capture decision-log telemetry metadata for QA bundles.
  3. Capture annotated staging tile screenshots (mock + live) and attach them to CX Escalations/Sales Pulse/Inventory packets before enablement circulation.
  4. Draft the rate-limit mitigation summary referencing the confirmed staging response path and embed it in enablement/support collateral.
- **Recommended next tasks (pending dependencies):**
  1. Draft Supabase SCC hash register template (`docs/compliance/evidence/supabase/scc/hash_register.md`) so signatures can be logged instantly upon arrival.
  2. Prep privacy messaging confirmation checklist for marketing/support (simple ack template + evidence locations) to accelerate sign-off once they respond.

## AI Agent Update — 2025-10-09 Restart Cycle Follow-Up
- Stash created per restart checklist (`git stash push --include-untracked --message "restart-cycle-2025-10-11"` → `stash@{0}`) and logged with UTC timestamp in `feedback/ai.md` so change control is auditable.
- Daily regression rerun completed post-restart (`npm run ai:regression` → PASS; BLEU 0.9444 / ROUGE-L 0.9565) with artifact `artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-2025-10-09-210754.json`; metrics appended to `feedback/ai.md`.
- Expanded dry-run kit to include Inventory Heatmap scenarios (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/inventory_heatmap_training_samples.md`) and refreshed the packet index (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/README.md`) so enablement has all three flows (CX, Sales Pulse, Inventory) linked.
- Authored Shopify sync rate-limit recovery coaching snippet for support/enablement (`docs/enablement/job_aids/shopify_sync_rate_limit_coaching.md`) covering operator script, verification checklist, and escalation path; flagged need to circulate for comms alignment.

## AI Agent Status — 2025-10-09 (EOD)
- Enablement packets now cover all three sprint flows with staging checklists, AI copy, and evidence logging steps. Pending: attach Supabase fact IDs and tile screenshots once staging secrets + decision-log fix arrive from reliability.
- Rate-limit coaching snippet drafted and linked from the kit README; waiting on support/product to review tone and distribution plan.
- Regression harness rerun green twice today with metrics logged; ready to expand dataset as soon as decision-log exports or additional Shopify scenarios land.
- Blocked item: Supabase staging credentials (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) and decision-log sync patch. Without them we can’t validate logging pipeline or populate artifacts. Notified reliability; standing by for delivery to proceed with evidence wiring and Memory updates.

## AI Agent Update — Supabase Staging Wiring (2025-10-09 Night)
- Received confirmation that Supabase staging secrets now live in `vault/occ/supabase/*.env` and mirror to the GitHub staging environment; ready to consume as soon as reliability finishes the MCP staging auth helper + facts migration.
- Prepared to capture Supabase fact IDs and dashboard screenshots the moment the migration completes; enablement packets already have placeholders that reference the fact types (`shopify.inventory.health`, decision logs).
- Memory updates planned: log the new evidence bundle paths under scope `build` and annotate BLEU/ROUGE deltas once fresh telemetry is attached.
- Outstanding dependencies: reliability still needs to (1) run the MCP staging auth helper so Shopify credentials land, (2) execute the Supabase facts migration, and (3) drop confirmation in the shared channel. I’m paused on final evidence wiring until those steps are done.

## AI Agent — Current State (Post-Supabase Wiring Confirmation)
- **Enablement kits ready for evidence:** `docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/*.md` and the rate-limit coaching doc wait only on Supabase fact IDs and tile screenshots. Placeholders point to `scope="ops"` decision logs and `shopify.inventory.health` facts.
- **Regression + metrics:** `npm run ai:regression` green; latest artifact at `artifacts/ai/prompt-regression-2025-10-09-210754.json`. Will append BLEU/ROUGE deltas to Memory once the new telemetry set is logged.
- **Supabase staging access:** Service key & Postgres DSN confirmed in vault and GitHub staging env. Awaiting reliability confirmation that (a) MCP staging auth helper ran (Shopify credentials delivered) and (b) Supabase facts migration executed successfully.
- **Next actions on unblock:** Capture fact IDs/screenshots, update enablement docs with evidence links, log Memory entries, and note completion in `feedback/ai.md`. Until then, holding to avoid stale or fabricated data.
