# Compliance Agent — Daily Status Log

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Re-read refreshed sprint focus (data inventory/retention matrix, Supabase incident runbook, vendor DPA audit) per `docs/directions/compliance.md`.
- Blocked from execution: currently serving as integrations coverage only; no bandwidth or access to drive compliance deliverables. Request dedicated compliance owner to resume tasks; latest status remains as logged below.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Circulated Supabase incident runbook to reliability/support for sign-off and scheduled follow-up for 2025-10-10 15:00 UTC; awaiting feedback before locking tabletop scenario.
- Updated vendor DPA reminder cadence (Supabase, GA MCP, Anthropic) and queued escalation note for manager if acknowledgements do not arrive by 2025-10-10 morning.
- Prepared retention matrix review checklist so collected Supabase cron evidence can be attached immediately once reliability shares logs; pending delivery of first-run artifacts.

## 2025-10-08 — Sprint Focus Activation
- Revalidated the data inventory + retention matrix against `docs/directions/compliance.md:26` goals; queued manager review of `docs/compliance/data_inventory.md` and `docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md` for the next governance sync.
- Began aligning the Supabase incident response runbook (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`) with reliability/support owners; drafted tabletop outline shell and waiting on their availability to continue per `docs/directions/compliance.md:27`.
- Pulled the latest vendor follow-up status into `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md` to keep the DPA audit moving; still blocked on vendor/legal responses noted in this log per `docs/directions/compliance.md:28`.

## 2025-10-07
- **Direction**: Acknowledged `docs/directions/compliance.md`; new compliance artifacts published (`docs/compliance/data_inventory.md`, `docs/runbooks/incident_response_breach.md`).
- **Data Inventory**: Documented processing activities across Shopify, Chatwoot, Supabase, GA MCP, Anthropic (planned), and caches. Flagged required retention automations and DPIA follow-up.
- **Incident Response Preparedness**: Drafted breach runbook covering detection→notification workflow, evidence handling, and quarterly readiness checklist; pending reliability/support review.
- **Contract Assessment**:
  - `GA MCP`: No processing terms or DPA stored in repo; need Google Cloud DPA reference + confirmation of EU data residency before MCP go-live.
  - `Supabase`: Secret rotation runbook exists, but DPA/SCC evidence absent. Need signed Supabase DPA, region confirmation (prefer `us-east-1`/`eu-central-1` clusters), and written RLS/backup posture. Request docs from manager/vendor.
  - `Anthropic`: Integration plan paused pending keys; require Enterprise Terms + data handling addendum (clarify prompt retention/log retention, regional endpoint). Also need operator consent language aligned with marketing copy.
- **Risk Log**:
  - R1: Retention automations missing for Prisma facts, sessions, Supabase decision logs. Owner: Engineering + Reliability. Target: 2025-10-18.
  - R2: Vendor DPAs (GA, Supabase, Anthropic) absent; compliance cannot green-light production. Owner: Manager to secure agreements. Target: 2025-10-14.
  - R3: Privacy notice lacks operator analytics disclosure. Owner: Marketing/Compliance. Target: 2025-10-12.
- **Next Actions**:
  1. Draft DPIA covering Chatwoot transcripts + Anthropic prompts (`docs/compliance/dpia_chatwoot_anthropic.md`).
  2. Partner with engineering to design Prisma/Supabase purge jobs; capture procedure evidence.
  3. Request vendor DPAs + data residency statements via manager; store in `docs/compliance/evidence/`.
- **Progress Update**: Generated vendor DPA request templates & evidence tracker (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`), published retention automation plan (`docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md`), documented Chatwoot/Anthropic DPIA (`docs/compliance/dpia_chatwoot_anthropic.md`), and drafted privacy notice language (`docs/compliance/privacy_notice_updates.md`). Awaiting manager/vendor responses and engineering implementation.
- **Follow-up**: Logged DPA outreach (`docs/compliance/evidence/*/request_2025-10-07.md`), added purge script (`scripts/ops/purge-dashboard-data.ts` + `npm run ops:purge-dashboard-data`), recorded Supabase cron draft, and updated launch FAQ with telemetry/AI disclosures.
- **Latest**: Ran purge script (log archived `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/2025-10-08_purge_log.json` once generated); recorded vendor follow-ups (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-08.md`); published privacy toggle rollout plan (`docs/marketing/privacy_toggle_rollout.md`) and staged final notice copy (`docs/compliance/evidence/privacy_notice/operator_notice_v2025-10-08.md`).

## 2025-10-08
- **Direction**: Re-read `docs/directions/compliance.md`; sprint focus confirmed (data inventory refresh, Supabase incident runbook, vendor agreement audit). All artifacts remain published under `docs/compliance/` pending manager review sign-off.
- **Data Inventory / Retention**: Inventory + retention matrix current (`docs/compliance/data_inventory.md`, `docs/compliance/retention_automation_plan.md`). Awaiting reliability evidence for scheduled Supabase `pg_cron` purge jobs before closing retention automation milestone.
- **Incident Response**: Supabase-specific incident runbook drafted at `docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md` (covers detection, containment, comms, evidence). Need reliability/support review plus first tabletop entry.
- **Vendor Agreements**: `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md` updated; still missing signed DPAs + residency confirmations for GA MCP, Supabase, Anthropic. Follow-up requests logged (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-08.md`).
- **Risks / Blockers**:
  - R2 (vendor DPAs) — Blocked until signatures + residency statements provided; manager engagement required.
  - R1 (retention automations) — Engineering must deploy Supabase/Prisma purge jobs and capture first-run evidence (`docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/`).
  - Need manager feedback on Supabase runbook scope before scheduling drill.
- **Next Actions**: Prepare drill outline + evidence template, escalate DPA/RLS gaps in manager update, coordinate with reliability on cron job deployment window, and backfill QA plan for purge script test harness.

## 2025-10-09
- **Direction**: Manager refresh reviewed (docs/directions/compliance.md; sprint focus unchanged). Acknowledgement + blocker summary relayed to manager via `feedback/manager.md` (2025-10-09 section).
- **Retention Automation**: Pending reliability rollout of Supabase `pg_cron` jobs + evidence attachment. Follow-up scheduled with reliability owner for 2025-10-10 14:00 ET; will archive first-run logs under `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/` once provided.
- **Vendor Agreements**: No responses yet on GA MCP, Supabase, Anthropic DPA/residency requests (see `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-08.md` and `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-09.md`). Added second reminder cadence for 2025-10-10 morning; continue to log receipts in `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`.
- **Incident Runbook**: Supabase decision logging runbook circulated (`docs/runbooks/incident_response_supabase.md`). Waiting on reliability/support sign-off + tabletop scheduling; drafting exercise template (`docs/compliance/evidence/tabletop_supabase_scenario.md` placeholder) for approval.
- **Blockers / Risks**:
  - Vendor DPAs + residency confirmations (R2) still unresolved; cannot green-light production.
  - Retention automation (R1) will remain open until cron deployment evidence shared.
  - Lack of test harness for purge script limits regression confidence; engineering help needed to scope stub dataset.
- **Next Actions**: Prep tabletop outline, chase vendor/legal responses via manager escalation, partner with reliability to collect cron evidence, and pair with engineering on purge script test plan.
- **Evidenced follow-ups**: Logged today's reminder cadence in `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-09.md`; will attach email receipts once vendors respond.

## 2025-10-10
- **Supabase Fix**: Revalidated incident runbook scope with reliability checklist; queued 2025-10-10 14:00 ET sync to capture pg_cron deployment evidence and confirm decision log residency. Drafted evidence pack template for `docs/compliance/evidence/retention_runs/` so logs can be archived immediately once delivered. Supabase DPA + residency escalation documented in `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-10.md`.
- **Staging Postgres + Secrets**: Coordinated with deployment to align on outstanding secret rows in `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`; compiled compliance review checklist for staging Postgres access (backup policy, RLS validation, audit trail). Waiting on reliability to publish vault paths + smoke artifacts before sign-off.
- **GA MCP Readiness**: Logged today’s vendor follow-up tracker (`docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_followups_2025-10-10.md`) referencing OCC-INF-221 outcome. Prepared compliance approval gate: block GA MCP go-live until Google DPA + subprocessor list filed under `docs/compliance/evidence/vendor_dpa_status.md`.
- **Operator Dry Run**: Verified privacy notice/FAQ artifacts remain current for the 2025-10-16 session (`docs/compliance/privacy_notice_updates.md`, `docs/marketing/launch_faq.md`). Ready to supply compliance talking points once enablement confirms agenda; awaiting staging access evidence to validate retention/purge steps during the walkthrough.
- **Open Blocks**: Still no vendor/legal responses (Supabase, GA MCP, Anthropic); staging Postgres credentials and Supabase cron outputs outstanding from reliability; dry run timing + access pending product/enablement reply. Escalations recorded in `feedback/manager.md` with request for manager assistance.
