# Data → Integrations/Compliance Coordination — 2025-10-08

## Credential Handoff Follow-up — 2025-10-08

- Pinged integrations lead for OCC-INF-221 update: requested GA MCP credential ETA and staging variable window to unlock `docs/data/ga_mcp_go_live_checklist.md` Step 1 parity run. Asked for confirmation by 2025-10-08 18:00 UTC so we can schedule the T0+3h readiness checkpoint.
- Nudged compliance counterpart to acknowledge the evidence checklist (`docs/data/ga_mcp_go_live_checklist.md`, parity artifacts, Supabase alert verification) and flag any missing audit requirements ahead of the swap.
- Re-attached coordination brief summary and outstanding needs, linking to `feedback/data.md:11` and `feedback/manager.md:44` so leadership sees the dependency trail.

## Pending Responses

- Integrations: Awaiting credential drop-off timing + staging variable window.
- Compliance: Awaiting written acknowledgment that the MCP evidence checklist covers required audits.

## Next Follow-up Window

- Send escalation to manager + reliability if no integrations update by 2025-10-08 20:00 UTC.
- Loop compliance again at 2025-10-09 14:00 UTC if acknowledgment still outstanding.

## Escalation Sent — 2025-10-08

- Escalated to manager and integrations lead requesting immediate GA MCP credential ETA, staging variable window, and written confirmation from compliance on the evidence checklist.
- Highlighted dependency on scheduling the T0+3h readiness checkpoint and committed to move as soon as credentials drop; requested status reply before EOD today.
