# Reliability → Data Coordination — 2025-10-09

## Supabase Decision Sync Log Export — Follow-up
- Responded to data request for 2025-10-07 18:00 UTC → 2025-10-08 12:00 UTC Supabase decision sync logs; confirmed retry/backoff patch deployed and offered to bundle latest NDJSON sample plus aggregate summary once engineering delivers monitor script.
- Provided interim guidance on log structure (fields: `decisionId`, `status`, `durationMs`, `errorCode`, `attempt`, `timestamp`) to ensure downstream notebooks can parse retries vs. final outcomes.
- Shared planned artifact locations: raw export under `artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_sync_<timestamp>.ndjson`, summary JSON under `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`.
- Requested data to confirm preferred secure handoff method for staging `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (1Password share vs. Vault drop) and to flag any schema expectations before we run the next export.

## Awaiting
- Confirmation from data on credential handoff path and ETA for analyzing the next export.
- Any additional metrics or slice requests to include (latency percentiles, retry breakdowns) prior to generating the new summary.

## Next Follow-up
- Schedule another check-in by 2025-10-09 18:30 UTC; escalate to manager if credentials/log export delivery remains blocked.
