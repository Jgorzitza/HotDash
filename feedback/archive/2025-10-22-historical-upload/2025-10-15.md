## Evidence Log
- Allowed: supabase/migrations/*, app/services/knowledge/*
- 2025-10-15 10:05 — Reviewed NORTH_STAR, OPERATING_MODEL, RULES, and ai-knowledge direction; current task is KB schema within `supabase/migrations/*`.
- 2025-10-15 10:32 — Added `supabase/migrations/20251016120000_kb_schema.sql` (+ rollback) covering kb_articles, kb_learning_edits, and kb_recurring_issues per spec; includes pgvector embedding support, RLS, triggers, and indexes.
- 2025-10-15 10:36 — Self-reviewed migration against `docs/specs/knowledge_base_design.md`; no SQL execution performed locally.
- 2025-10-15 10:45 — Attempted `supabase status`; blocked by Docker permission in sandbox (`permission denied ... /var/run/docker.sock`).
- 2025-10-15 10:50 — Ran `supabase start` with elevated permissions; local Supabase stack healthy at 127.0.0.1:54321 (CLI v2.48.3).
- 2025-10-15 10:55 — `supabase migration up` failed: remote migration 20251010011019_facts_table.sql missing locally (exists in `supabase/migrations.backup`).
- 2025-10-15 11:00 — Fetched historical migrations via `supabase migration fetch --local`, restoring `20251010011019_facts_table.sql` to migrations directory.
- 2025-10-15 11:05 — `supabase migration up` still failed (duplicate schema_migrations entry); applied `supabase/migrations/20251016120000_kb_schema.sql` manually with `psql` and recorded version `20251016120000` in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`.
- 2025-10-15 11:10 — Verified KB tables exist via `\dt public.kb_*`; Supabase stack still running (`supabase status`).
