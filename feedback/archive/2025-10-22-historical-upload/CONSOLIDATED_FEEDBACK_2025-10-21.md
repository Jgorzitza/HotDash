# CONSOLIDATED AGENT FEEDBACK - 2025-10-21T02:25Z

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### üö® P0 DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER
**Issue**: Code exists in git but NOT deployed to staging
**Impact**: Blocks Pilot testing, AI-Customer verification
**Evidence**: 
- AI-Customer (02:15 UTC): Grading sliders code in git (631edc4) but NOT in deployed v71
- Pilot (19:50 UTC 10/20): Modal buttons timeout, React errors in production
**Root Cause**: Stale deployment - v71 from Oct 20 23:13 UTC missing recent commits
**Resolution**: Deploy latest code to staging (v72+)

### üíé MAJOR PROGRESS: Engineer Completed 3 Phases!
**Engineer** (10/21): 
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Missing Dashboard Tiles (9/9 tiles complete)
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: Notification System (toasts, banners, browser notifications)  
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: Real-Time Features (SSE, live badge, auto-refresh)
- Commits: cd9a6e2, 3c95d84, 44f72e1
- Total: 45 files, ~4,400 lines, 15 hours work in single session

### ‚úÖ Validation Status
**Designer** (10/21):
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: PASSED (30 min validation)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 4: NOT VALIDATED YET
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 5: NOT VALIDATED YET

### ‚úÖ Backend Services Complete
**Analytics** (10/21): ‚úÖ WoW variance service (ANALYTICS-005, 1h)
**Support** (10/21): ‚úÖ Multi-channel testing (email‚úÖ, chat‚úÖ, SMS‚ùå no Twilio creds)
**AI-Customer** (10/21): ‚úÖ Deployment blocker identified + documented

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started
**QA**: Code review task NOT started (should have reviewed Phases 3-5)
**Pilot**: Testing blocked by deployment issue
