# üö® CRITICAL: Shopify App Misconfiguration - P0 BLOCKER

**Date**: 2025-10-19T21:00:00Z  
**Severity**: **P0 - LAUNCH BLOCKER**  
**Reported By**: Pilot Agent  
**Escalated To**: Manager  

---

## Issue Summary

The HotDash Shopify app is configured to point to a **local development tunnel** instead of the **production Fly.io deployment**, causing the app to be completely non-functional in Shopify Admin.

---

## Evidence

### Current Configuration (INCORRECT) ‚ùå

**App URL in Shopify**: 
```
https://physiology-spoken-magnificent-much.trycloudflare.com/
```

**Status**: DNS lookup failure (tunnel not running)

**Error Message**: 
```
"physiology-spoken-magnificent-much.trycloudflare.com's server IP address could not be found."
```

**Dev Console Shows**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è App preview: **ON**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Status: "Previewing your local changes"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Extensions appear when you run `shopify app dev`

### Expected Configuration (CORRECT) ‚úÖ

**Production URL Should Be**: 
```
https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev
```

**Status**: Production server healthy and accessible (verified earlier)

---

## Root Cause

1. **App was switched to dev mode** at some point
2. **Cloudflare tunnel URL** was saved as app URL
3. **Tunnel is not running** (local dev stopped)
4. **Production URL** (Fly.io) is not configured in Shopify

---

## Impact

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Production server running: `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev`
- ‚ùå Shopify app URL: Points to dead Cloudflare tunnel
- ‚ùå App unusable in Shopify Admin
- ‚ùå Dashboard testing blocked
- ‚ùå Launch blocked

### User Experience
- Store owner sees error iframe in Shopify Admin
- App appears broken/non-functional
- Cannot access dashboard or any features

---

## Required Fix

### Shopify App Configuration Update

**Location**: Shopify Partners Dashboard ‚Üí HotDash App ‚Üí Configuration

**Changes Needed**:

1. **App URL**: 
   - Current: `https://physiology-spoken-magnificent-much.trycloudflare.com/`
   - Change to: `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev`

2. **Allowed redirection URLs**:
   - Ensure `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/auth/callback` is allowed
   - Ensure `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/auth/shopify/callback` is allowed

3. **Disable Dev Preview Mode**:
   - Turn off "App preview" in Dev Console
   - Ensure production mode is active

4. **Verify App Proxy** (if configured):
   - Should point to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/proxy`

---
