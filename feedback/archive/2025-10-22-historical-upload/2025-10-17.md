# AI-Knowledge — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary
- Added `app/services/knowledge/ingestion.stub.ts` documenting pending decisions.
- Captured assumptions + contract test instructions in `docs/specs/knowledge_pipeline.md`.
- Waiting on manager-issued Issue/Allowed paths to proceed with production ingestion work.

## Evidence
```bash
node -e "import('./app/services/knowledge/ingestion.stub.ts').then(m => m.ingestKnowledgeStub().then(console.log))"
node -e "import('./app/services/knowledge/embeddings/openai.ts').then(m => m.generateEmbedding('hello world').then(v => console.log(v.length)))"
```
- Spec updated: see `docs/specs/knowledge_pipeline.md` for decision matrix and environment wiring.

## Blockers / Risks
1. Allowed paths + owner approvals for KB source directories.
2. Provision OpenAI embedding credentials (text-embedding-3-small) for ingestion pipeline.
3. Supabase service role credentials for knowledge tables.
4. HITL workflow definition for ingest approvals.

## Next Steps
- Integrate OpenAI client once credentials provided.
- Align with DevOps on Supabase role provisioning.
- Draft HITL ingestion approval runbook.
