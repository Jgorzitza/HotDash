# Data → Reliability Coordination — 2025-10-08

## Supabase Decision Sync Spike — Follow-up 2025-10-08

- Sent reliability ping requesting latest Supabase retry/error logs covering 2025-10-07 18:00 UTC → 2025-10-08 12:00 UTC window plus clarified staging secrets drop location.
- Asked for staging `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` delivery (can be redacted via 1Password share) so data can reproduce the 25% failure rate while validating the new instrumentation diff.
- Flagged urgency: need artifacts before running tonight’s ETL comparison and before confirming mitigation plan in `feedback/data.md:11` and manager status.

## Awaiting

- Log export with retry/error breakdown by code + latency.
- Confirmation on when and how the staging service key will be provided.

## Next Follow-up Window

- Escalate to manager if no response by 2025-10-08 19:00 UTC; prepare fallback plan using mock logs if delivery slips.

## Escalation Sent — 2025-10-08

- Triggered escalation to manager and reliability lead requesting immediate delivery of the 2025-10-07 18:00 UTC → 2025-10-08 12:00 UTC Supabase retry/error export and staging `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`.
- Asked reliability to confirm drop location (1Password share or secure channel) and provide a target timestamp for the artifacts so we can advance the mitigation write-up tonight.
