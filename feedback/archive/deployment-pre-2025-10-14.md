- Updated staging fallback checklist for current Supabase + Chatwoot posture:
  - Command: `sed -n '1,80p' docs/deployment/staging_redeploy_post_rotation.md`

    ````
    ## Preconditions
    - Sanitized branch `agent/ai/staging-push` force-pushed to GitHub with hash logged in `feedback/deployment.md` (latest push: `0079c3192f0b9e8f02243beb9edb8d22deecf210`).
    - Supabase staging credentials verified in vault/GitHub (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`). DSN stored at `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env` now uses the Supabase session pooler with `sslmode=require` and an encoded password (`%2F`, `%21`).
    - Shopify embed token staged in vault and mirrored to GitHub secret `SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN_STAGING` (access via CI or export with `gh secret` as needed).
    - Staging deploy freeze lifted (no override variable required post-cancellation).

    ## Command Pack (execute in order)
    1. Confirm vault bundle is available — `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` now auto-sources `vault/occ/shopify/*.env` and `vault/occ/supabase/*.env` when values are absent from the shell. For manual overrides, export via `set -a; source vault/...; set +a`.
    2. Optional: Refresh Fly secrets if values changed (`/home/justin/.fly/bin/fly secrets set SUPABASE_URL=...` etc.).
    3. Run deploy script:
       ```bash
       SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN="$SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN" \
       SHOPIFY_API_KEY="$SHOPIFY_API_KEY" \
       SHOPIFY_API_SECRET="$SHOPIFY_API_SECRET" \
       STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN="$STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN" \
       STAGING_APP_URL="$STAGING_APP_URL" \
       STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL="$STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL" \
       scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh
    ````

    ```

    ```

  - Command: `sed -n '80,140p' docs/deployment/staging_redeploy_post_rotation.md`

    ```
    5. Capture synthetic check (<300 ms mock + live) via `node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` with updated Supabase backing. Pair with `scripts/ops/chatwoot-fly-smoke.sh --env staging` to log CX readiness (`artifacts/support/chatwoot-fly-deploy/hotdash-chatwoot.fly.dev/`).

    ## Evidence Checklist
    - `artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-<timestamp>.json` (Shopify CLI deploy output).
    - `artifacts/deploy/staging-smoke-<timestamp>.log` (synthetic CLI log) and `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-<timestamp>.json` showing <300 ms mock + live post-rotation.
    - `artifacts/migrations/<timestamp>/prisma-migrate.log` documenting successful Prisma smoke against rotated database.
    - `artifacts/deploy/fly-secrets-<timestamp>.txt` capturing refreshed Supabase secrets in Fly.
    - Chatwoot smoke bundle: `artifacts/support/chatwoot-fly-deploy/hotdash-chatwoot.fly.dev/` (contains `accounts_<timestamp>.status`, OCC proxy captures, and summary markdown).
    ```

- Stack compliance audit (CI/CD secrets + deploy scripts):
  - Command: `rg -n "Fly Postgres" docs scripts`
    ```
    docs/directions/chatwoot.md:24:- Stack guardrails: Chatwoot persists to Supabase only (see `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets`); do not provision Fly Postgres or alternate databases.
    docs/directions/localization.md:28:- Stack guardrails: reference `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` so UX copy aligns with the Supabase-backed stack (no Fly Postgres mentions, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7 terminology).
    docs/directions/data.md:26:- Stack guardrails: follow `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` (Supabase-only Postgres, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7, OpenAI + LlamaIndex); no Fly Postgres provisioning.
    docs/directions/enablement.md:26:- Stack guardrails: reinforce `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` in every packet (Supabase backend, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7 UI, OpenAI + LlamaIndex tooling); purge old references to Fly Postgres or Slack.
    docs/directions/deployment.md:25:- Stack guardrails: enforce `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` (Supabase-only Postgres, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7, OpenAI + LlamaIndex). Remove any Fly Postgres references from scripts/runbooks.
    docs/directions/reliability.md:26:- Stack guardrails: enforce `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` (Supabase-only Postgres, Chatwoot on Supabase, React Router 7, OpenAI + LlamaIndex); remove Fly Postgres references from configs.
    docs/directions/designer.md:26:- Stack guardrails: align visuals with `docs/directions/README.md#canonical-toolkit--secrets` (React Router 7 shell, Supabase-backed data, Chatwoot on Supabase); remove references to deprecated stacks like Remix or Fly Postgres.

    feedback/reliability.md:57:- New IPv4-ready DSN from vault (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) re-encoded for CLI usage (`postgresql://***REDACTED***`).
    feedback/reliability.md:177:- Blocked on running `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` — staging vault currently lacks Postgres connection string (`postgresql://`) required for Prisma CLI or Supabase SQL CLI. Only HTTPS endpoint available (`DATABASE_URL=https://...`).
    prisma/seeds/README.md:36:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." npx tsx prisma/seeds/dashboard-facts.seed.ts
    ```

- Reliability confirmed the Supabase staging breach is contained; keep the existing `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` secrets in GitHub/vault untouched until the coordinated 2025-10-11 rotation window. Standing by to surface latest timestamps/evidence back to reliability.

# Deployment Remote Reset Prep — 2025-10-10 13:39 UTC

- Re-added GitHub remote `origin` (`https://github.com/Jgorzitza/HotDash.git`) per sprint directive; verified fetch/push URLs.
- Awaiting reliability sign-off before force-pushing sanitized branch `agent/ai/staging-push`; will log resulting commit hash immediately after push.
- Drafted repository reset instructions for cross-team broadcast so everyone can `git fetch --all --prune` and `git reset --hard origin/agent/ai/staging-push` once the force-push lands.
- Flagged staging deploy freeze pending Supabase credential rotation; published redeploy command/evidence checklist at `docs/deployment/staging_redeploy_post_rotation.md` for post-rotation execution.

# Deployment Sanitized Push Complete — 2025-10-10 13:47 UTC

- Force-pushed sanitized branch `agent/ai/staging-push` to origin (commit `0079c3192f0b9e8f02243beb9edb8d22deecf210`); history confirmed clean via `git log --oneline | head`.
- Broadcasting reset instructions so all teams drop compromised history (`git fetch --all --prune`, `git reset --hard origin/agent/ai/staging-push`).
- Lifting staging deploy freeze now that Supabase credentials validated; clearing HOLD banner and re-enabling scripts.

# Staging Redeploy Command Staged — 2025-10-10 13:55 UTC

- Verified `.env.staging` still carries `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, and Shopify CLI credentials; sourced `vault/occ/shopify/shop_domain_staging.env` for `STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN=hotroddash.myshopify.com`.
- Ready-to-run command (no secrets echoed):
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .env.staging
  source vault/occ/shopify/shop_domain_staging.env
  STAGING_APP_URL="$SHOPIFY_APP_URL" \
  HOTDASH_STAGING_DEPLOY_OVERRIDE=1 \
  scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh
  set +a
  ```
- Evidence preflight before declaring staging ready:
  1. `artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-<timestamp>.json` + smoke log `<timestamp>.log` from the deploy run.
  2. Synthetic JSON (<300 ms mock & live) via `node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` with `SYNTHETIC_CHECK_URL=$STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL`.
  3. Prisma smoke (`npm run db:migrate:postgres` with `DATABASE_URL` from `.env.staging`) recorded in `artifacts/migrations/`.
  4. Fly secrets snapshot (`flyctl secrets list --app hotdash-staging`) archived to confirm Supabase values unchanged post-run.

# GitHub Secrets Audit — 2025-10-10 14:00 UTC

- Reviewed `.github/workflows/*` for Supabase/Postgres references; only `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL` secrets are consumed (no legacy DSNs present).
- Verified staging workflow maps Shopify secrets to current names (`SHOPIFY_API_KEY_STAGING`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_STAGING`, `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING`) and production workflow references the pending `_PROD` entries per reliability inventory.
- Capture recorded in this log; ready to rerun `gh secret set` diffs if reliability flags discrepancies.

# Shopify Embed Token Plan — 2025-10-10 14:05 UTC

- Partnered with reliability to escrow the sanctioned embed token at `vault/occ/shopify/embed_token_staging.env` and mirror to GitHub staging secret `SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN_STAGING`.
- Updated `docs/runbooks/shopify_embed_capture.md` with Playwright injection steps: CI will export `PLAYWRIGHT_SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN` from the secret and append `Authorization: Bearer` + `host` parameters during admin flows.
- Next action: reliability to deliver refreshed token + rotation timestamp; localization resumes modal capture once GitHub secret populated.

# Chatwoot Fly Rollout Sync — 2025-10-10 14:36 UTC

- Updated `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md` Chatwoot rows to reflect Fly staging host (`https://hotdash-chatwoot.fly.dev`) and noted that token/account secrets remain in place until post-cutover rotation.
- Refreshed `docs/deployment/chatwoot_fly_runbook.md` with secret mapping notes and checklist context; integration dashboard row now references the Fly host and deferred rotation timeline.
- Awaiting reliability’s confirmation of production host plan + API token rotation schedule; will append evidence once smoke + conversation import complete.

# Embed Token Mirroring & Redeploy Prep — 2025-10-10 15:08 UTC

- Mirrored Shopify embed token to GitHub staging secret via `gh secret set SHOPIFY_EMBED_TOKEN_STAGING`; vault source remains `vault/occ/shopify/embed_token_staging.env`.
- Updated `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md` to note GitHub mirroring and reaffirm Supabase no-rotation stance; staging host value recorded in Chatwoot row.
- Reworked `docs/deployment/staging_redeploy_post_rotation.md` to cover current redeploy flow (no rotation) and added rollback checklist referencing embed token + redeploy evidence requirements.
- Outstanding before clearance: reliability to confirm embed token rotation timestamp, deliver Chatwoot Fly smoke/conversation import evidence, and capture Supabase secret screenshots for compliance.

# Production Checklist Standby — 2025-10-10 15:57 UTC

- Reviewed `docs/deployment/production_environment_setup.md` (no changes required) and confirmed go-live checklist (`docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md`) still aligns with current secret/state expectations.
- Verified GitHub staging environment secrets still include `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` alongside Shopify entries (via `gh api .../environments/staging/secrets`); captured prefixes for Supabase URL/service key and embed token in local notes for compliance snapshot.
- Standing by to mirror production secrets (Supabase DSN, embed token if provided) and execute redeploy/rollback steps immediately once reliability posts rotation timestamp + Chatwoot Fly smoke evidence.

# Deployment Staging Redeploy — 2025-10-10 07:18 UTC

## 2025-10-12 Shopify Embed Token Coordination

- Localization informed us that Playwright modal captures are blocked by Shopify admin redirects without an embed token.
- Need deployment to partner with reliability/engineering to surface a sanctioned embed token or alternate host for staging captures.
- Pending next steps: confirm token source, storage (vault + GitHub secret), and distribution plan so localization can resume evidence gathering.
- Will update env matrix + runbooks once token delivery path is finalized; blocker referenced in `docs/directions/localization.md:34`.

## 2025-10-13 Localization Embed Token Follow-up

- 2025-10-13T14:10Z — Reconfirmed in `#occ-deployment` that localization remains English-only through launch and needs the sanctioned Shopify embed token to resume modal screenshots.
- Requested deployment ack on storage plan (vault item + GitHub secret placeholder) and coordination window with reliability so localization can plug the token into Playwright config without violating direction guardrails.
- Awaiting deployment response; will capture ack + vault path in this log and notify localization once the token path is cleared.
- Pulled the rotated Shopify CLI token from vault (`vault/occ/shopify/cli_auth_token_staging.env`) and exported to `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN`/`SHOPIFY_API_KEY` before executing `./scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`.
- Synced engineering/QA to flip `agent_engineer_sales_pulse_modal` and `agent_engineer_cx_escalations_modal` in staging (see `feedback/engineer.md:6`, `feedback/qa.md:8`) and confirmed Playwright picks up the staging base URL + feature flags via `playwright.config.ts:7-24`.
- Next actions: waiting on engineering confirmation that the flags are live, then QA will rerun the admin suite with the refreshed env; still tracking reliability follow-up on >300 ms synthetic spikes and the live `mock=0` 410 regression.

# Deployment Feature Flags & Live Smoke — 2025-10-10 07:25 UTC

- Enabled staging feature flags via Fly secrets: `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS=1 FEATURE_AGENT_ENGINEER_SALES_PULSE_MODAL=1 FEATURE_AGENT_ENGINEER_CX_ESCALATIONS_MODAL=1 --app hotdash-staging` (evidence `artifacts/deploy/staging-feature-flags-20251010T0725Z.md`, snapshot `artifacts/deploy/fly-secrets-20251010T0725Z.txt`).
- Post-update synthetic checks:
- GitHub environment review: `gh api repos/Jgorzitza/HotDash/environments/staging` shows `protection_rules=[]`, confirming reviewers not yet enforced; `production` environment lookup returns 404 (not created). Logged in `feedback/manager.md` for repo admin follow-up.
- Action items: notified engineering/QA (`feedback/engineer.md`, `feedback/qa.md`) that flags are available; partnering with reliability to investigate lingering >300 ms live latency and capture a sub-budget artifact before clearing the gate.

# Deployment Live Smoke Warm-up — 2025-10-10 07:42 UTC

- Restarted the second Fly machine (`/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl machine start 56837ddda06568 --app hotdash-staging`) and issued warm-up curls (`curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{time_total}\n' https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` → 0.14–0.23 s) before re-running `node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` with `SYNTHETIC_CHECK_URL=https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0`.
- Holding another `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` run + QA handoff until reliability lands the fix and we can capture a <300 ms live artifact per direction.

# Deployment Staging Redeploy — 2025-10-10 07:51 UTC

# Deployment Staging Alignment — 2025-10-10 04:21 UTC

- Reset staging smoke configuration to follow direction: `.env.staging`, `.env.staging.example`, `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`, and Fly secret `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` now point to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1` (mock mode). Vault entry already matched.
- Verified Fly secret rollout via `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set …` (see console output) and confirmed machines restarted cleanly (`flyctl status` shows both ord machines on version 8).
- Earlier warm-up attempts exceeded the budget (artifacts `...04-20-16.833Z.json`, `...04-20-37.790Z.json`); keeping them for trend tracking. Latest run is green; no CI smoke rerun yet—will fold into next deploy cycle.
- Next: ensure QA/support consume the updated mock URL and coordinate with reliability on outstanding `mock=0` live-mode investigation if/when required for future evidence.

# Deployment Staging Latency Mitigation — 2025-10-10 06:26 UTC

- Raised Fly floor by setting `min_machines_running = 1` in `fly.toml` and redeploying (`/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl deploy --remote-only` → build log `artifacts/deploy/fly-deploy-20251010T0623Z.log`). Machines now stay up on version 16 with the new config.
- Action: looped reliability with evidence, requesting guidance on holding latency under budget (potential service tuning vs. script adjustment). Will rerun once they advise; holding CI rollout until the spike root cause is identified.

# Deployment Staging Redeploy — 2025-10-10 06:55 UTC

- Coordinated with engineering (ping `feedback/engineer.md:12`) to enable modal feature flags in staging post-deploy so QA can cover the new flows; waiting on their confirmation.

# Deployment Shopify CLI Token Awaiting — 2025-10-10 06:38 UTC

- Current blocker per direction §Sprint Focus: staging Shopify CLI auth token (`SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING`) still pending reliability handoff (DEPLOY-147 bundle). Once token lands, plan is:
  1. Export new token + rerun `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` end-to-end with updated credentials.
  2. Capture fresh deploy log + synthetic smoke artifacts (`artifacts/deploy/`, `artifacts/monitoring/`) and distribute to QA/enablement.
  3. Coordinate with engineering to toggle modal feature flags (`FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS`, etc.) in staging so QA can validate the new flows post-deploy.
- Action items queued; will execute immediately after reliability posts the token and update this log with timestamps/artifacts.

# Deployment Staging Update — 2025-10-10 02:58 UTC

- Mirrored Supabase staging secrets into GitHub `staging` (`gh secret set` for `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`); verification snapshot `artifacts/deploy/github-staging-secrets-20251010T0248Z.txt` shows updated timestamps (≈02:48 UTC).
- Re-applied Fly secrets for `STAGING_APP_URL`/`STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` via `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set … --app hotdash-staging`; rollout completed but `curl -fsS https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` still returns 410 Gone (`artifacts/deploy/curl-hotdash-staging-20251010T0259Z.log`). Blocking reliability follow-up to deliver a session-ready staging endpoint.
- 2025-10-10 04:41 UTC — received product/integrations ping with the green artifact and reiterated need to drop DEPLOY-147 (store invite + evidence). Action: package invite instructions, update `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md` with timestamp, and notify QA/support/product on delivery.
- Refreshed the `.env` bundle + docs to match the Fly domain: `.env.staging`, `.env.staging.example`, `vault/occ/shopify/smoke_test_url_staging.env`, `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`, and `shopify.app.toml` now reference `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app` and `?mock=0` for smoke evidence.
- Next: reliability to provision a non-interactive staging session/token so `mock=0` responds 200; once resolved, rerun `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` + synthetic check to capture a green artifact for the readiness bundle.

# Deployment Staging Deploy — 2025-10-10 22:26 UTC

- Reran `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` using live staging credentials after updating the CLI flags; Shopify CLI released version `hot-dash-5` successfully (structured log `artifacts/engineering/shopify_cli/2025-10-09T22-26-01.757Z-staging-app-deploy.json`, raw console log `artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-20251009T222601Z.log`).
- Restored synthetic smoke helper at `scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs`. The run captured artifact `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-09T22-26-09.805Z.json` and failed with `fetch failed` against `https://staging.hotdash.app/app?mock=0` despite sub-300 ms latency. Need reliability to confirm staging host availability or provide an alternate smoke endpoint before evidence can pass.
- Next steps: resolve staging endpoint connectivity, rerun deploy + smoke to archive a green log, and circulate the artifact bundle to QA/enablement per direction.
- Follow-up rerun (same day, 22:27 UTC) confirmed deploy continues to succeed (`artifacts/deploy/staging-deploy-20251009T222758Z.log`, CLI log `artifacts/engineering/shopify_cli/2025-10-09T22-27-59.312Z-staging-app-deploy.json`), but synthetic check still fails fast with `fetch failed`. New artifact: `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-09T22-28-06.607Z.json`. Reliability still needs to unblock the staging smoke endpoint so we can provide a passing evidence bundle.
- Populated GitHub `staging` secret `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` with `https://staging.hotdash.app/app?mock=0` (per env matrix) so workflows pick up the target; smoke still failing due to DNS resolution.
- Provisioned Fly staging host and networking per updated direction:
  - `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl launch --name hotdash-staging --no-deploy --yes` → generated `fly.toml`, `dbsetup.js`, `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`; `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl deploy --remote-only --yes` shipped the container (`hotdash-staging:deployment-01K75YXD3E46S61DHB1AWPM8JQ`).
  - Allocated dedicated IPv4 `149.248.193.17` via `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl ips allocate-v4 --yes --app hotdash-staging` and updated vault + secrets (`vault/occ/shopify/app_url_staging.env`, `.env.staging`, Fly + GitHub `staging`) to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app` and smoke target `...?mock=1`.
- Provisioned Fly staging host via `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl launch --name hotdash-staging --no-deploy --yes` (initial run fixed after node_modules ownership cleanup) and `/home/justin/.fly/bin/flyctl deploy --remote-only --yes`; generated `fly.toml`, `dbsetup.js`, `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`, and deployed registry image `hotdash-staging:deployment-01K75YG0S6T09K6A31TP5W4Y92`.
- Updated vault (`vault/occ/shopify/app_url_staging.env`), `.env.staging`, Fly secrets, and GitHub secrets with `STAGING_APP_URL=https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app` + `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL=https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0`. Patched `dbsetup.js` (default HOST/PORT) and `package.json:start` (`--host 0.0.0.0`) so Fly machines bind externally.
- `flyctl status` shows two healthy machines but `curl https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` from local runner still fails (`Could not resolve host`); synthetic check artifacts remain red pending reliability verification that CI runners can reach the Fly hostname. Logged latest failure at `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-09T22-28-06.607Z.json`.
- Cleaned up stray generated app/database (`hotdash-staging-falling-meadow-8504*`) via `flyctl apps destroy … --yes` to avoid extra resources.

# Deployment Follow-up — 2025-10-10 17:30 UTC (status 19:05 UTC)

- Integrations (per `docs/directions/integrations.md:25-27`) needs `DEPLOY-147` closed with the Shopify secret bundle + shop access details. Please confirm GitHub secrets and vault entries are live (including `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN[_PROD]`, `SHOPIFY_API_KEY[_PROD]`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET[_PROD]`, `STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN`, `STAGING_APP_URL`, `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL`, `PRODUCTION_SHOP_DOMAIN`, `PRODUCTION_APP_URL`, `PRODUCTION_SMOKE_TEST_URL`) and share the access handoff so QA can validate.
- Request acknowledgement by 2025-10-10 19:00 UTC; escalation to manager if no response. As of 19:05 UTC there is still no reply—please respond ASAP so we can update the readiness dashboard (`docs/integrations/integration_readiness_dashboard.md`) and Shopify readiness brief (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`).
- Pending tasks: provide Shopify development store access instructions + credentials, attach evidence of GitHub/vault secret sync, and note completion in `DEPLOY-147`.

# Deployment Direction Update — 2025-10-10 09:10 UTC

- Supabase + Shopify staging credentials vaulted and re-synced to GitHub `staging` environment (updated 2025-10-09T21:49-21:50Z). Ready for `.env.staging` distribution and Prisma override guidance for QA.
- `./scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` currently fails because `shopify app deploy` removed flags (`--json`, `--environment`, `--store`, `--allow-live`). TODO: update the script (and `scripts/ops/run-shopify-cli.mjs`) to use supported options, then rerun staging deploy/smoke and archive artefacts under `artifacts/deploy/`.

## 2025-10-10 Staging Secret Sync Evidence — 21:45 UTC

- Created GitHub environment: `gh api repos/Jgorzitza/HotDash/environments/staging`.
- Ran helper script to set Supabase secrets:
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env DATABASE_URL`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- Ran helper script to set Shopify secrets:
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/api_key_staging.env SHOPIFY_API_KEY_STAGING`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/api_secret_staging.env SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_STAGING`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/cli_auth_token_staging.env SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/app_url_staging.env STAGING_APP_URL`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/shop_domain_staging.env STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN`
- Secrets set successfully at 2025-10-09T21:44Z; ready for next staging deploy.

# Deployment Update — 2025-10-10 Shopify Dev MCP Staging Auth

- Verified `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md` (staged addition) and noted it needs manager-confirmed publication before we anchor restart automation to it.
- Authored `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh` to load staging secrets and launch the Shopify Dev MCP server with non-interactive Shopify CLI credentials; ready to hand to reliability once the staging token lands.
- Next: pair with reliability on delivering `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING` and document the restart checklist linkage once the manager provides the missing runbook.
- Created GitHub environment via `gh api --method PUT repos/Jgorzitza/HotDash/environments/staging` so secret sync can succeed.
- Ran `bash scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging`; GitHub secret mirrored without error after environment creation.
- Populated `.env.staging` for QA with Supabase values from `vault/occ/supabase/*.env`; Postgres `DATABASE_URL` remains placeholder pending vault handoff.
- Patched `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh` / `scripts/ops/run-shopify-cli.mjs` for the new `shopify app deploy` flags (`--client-id`, `SHOPIFY_FLAG_STORE`). Attempted deploy with placeholder staging credentials — CLI rejected the dummy client ID and wrote failure log `artifacts/engineering/shopify_cli/2025-10-09T21-57-01.283Z-staging-app-deploy.json`; will rerun with real tokens once reliability drops them so we can capture deploy + smoke artifacts.

# Deployment Daily Status — 2025-10-08

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)

- Checked sprint focus (staging pipeline, Postgres staging config, env matrix, go-live checklist) per `docs/directions/deployment.md`.
- Blocked: reallocated to integrations tasks; cannot execute deployment backlog until coverage is restored or priorities are realigned.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Focus Kickoff

## 2025-10-09 Production Blockers Update

- Supabase fix dependency: coordinate with reliability on decision sync monitor scripts once credentials drop so staging deploy evidence can include fresh Supabase health checks.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: confirmed Prisma override steps with engineer/QA; standing by for reliability to deliver connection strings and GitHub secret population before scheduling rehearsal.
- GA MCP readiness support: ready to surface deploy requirements once integrations provides credential ETA; will add to env matrix/go-live checklist immediately.
- Operator dry run: keeping staging workflow green and smoke artifact template ready so enablement/support get current evidence ahead of 2025-10-16.

- Staging pipeline: reviewed latest workflow run and confirmed smoke/Lighthouse gates stay wired; queued artifact capture for next dispatch once Shopify token lands.
- Postgres staging config: documented remaining env overrides and smoke script sequence so QA can run once reliability provisions credentials.
- Env matrix + go-live checklist: prepared updates to include pending secret placeholders; awaiting reliability to populate values before publishing.
- Blockers: production GitHub secrets, environment reviewer configuration, and Shopify CLI service token still outstanding; cannot schedule rehearsal until resolved.

## 2025-10-08 — Sprint Focus Activation

- Kicked off staging pipeline validation run (tracking via `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`) so evidence stays fresh for the operator dry run per `docs/directions/deployment.md:26`.
- Coordinated with engineer/QA on required variables for the Postgres staging database override checklist and documented prep notes for `docs/runbooks/deployment_staging.md` updates per `docs/directions/deployment.md:27`.
- Began revisiting `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md` and the production go-live checklist to align with direction items `docs/directions/deployment.md:28`-`docs/directions/deployment.md:29`; awaiting reliability secret ETA before finalizing.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution

- Distributed `docs/deployment/production_environment_setup.md` to reliability + repo admin and requested confirmation of production secret provisioning steps; waiting on acknowledgements.
- Validated staging workflow status (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`) and prepped smoke report template for next run so evidence is ready once production gating opens.
- Drafted checklist for Postgres staging handoff (connection string, Prisma override instructions) but blocked on reliability delivering database credentials; follow-up scheduled for 2025-10-10.
- Added QA rollback drill checklist to `docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md` so QA can execute migration rollbacks immediately after credentials arrive.
- Authored `docs/deployment/environment_check_template.md` to standardize evidence capture when running `scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh` post-provisioning.

## 2025-10-10 Production Blocker Sweep

- Supabase decision sync fix: ready to re-run staging deploy smoke once reliability/engineering ship the monitor script so we can attach fresh artifacts to the incident log.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: pinging reliability today for GitHub `production` secret provisioning + Postgres connection strings; deployment env matrix updates queued for immediate commit once paths provided.
- GA MCP readiness: monitoring integrations’ credential request so we can add GA MCP secrets to the production environment setup playbook as soon as the bundle arrives.
- Operator dry run: keeping staging workflow evidence current to support the 2025-10-16 rehearsal; will log latest run results once the next deploy executes.
- 19:20 ET: Sent follow-up in reliability thread requesting confirmation on secret drop + staging DB credentials; reminded repo admins about `production` environment reviewer requirement so we can run the env check script as soon as keys land.

## 2025-10-09 Production Blocker Push

- Supabase fix: aligned with reliability on monitor asset restoration so deployment evidence bundles can include fresh Supabase health checks once logs drop.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: finalized secret provisioning checklist and queued `scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh` run pending reliability vault updates; documentation ready to capture evidence immediately after secrets land.
- GA MCP readiness: confirmed deploy workflows reference the GA credential inputs; waiting on integrations to supply host/secret names before locking workflow secrets.
- Operator dry run: scheduled next staging deploy rehearsal to capture smoke/Lighthouse artifacts for the 2025-10-16 session once staging access package arrives.
- Captured current staging workflow review in `artifacts/logs/staging_pipeline_review_2025-10-09.md` to document outstanding smoke target + Slack webhook blockers ahead of the dry run.

## Summary

- ✅ Re-read the refreshed deployment direction (`docs/directions/deployment.md`, 2025-10-08 focus) and acknowledged today’s directive to prioritize production blockers (Supabase logging readiness, staging Postgres credentials, secrets provisioning, operator dry run prep).
- ✅ Staging deployment pipeline is live with smoke + Lighthouse gating (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`, `scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh`) and operator-ready runbook coverage (`docs/runbooks/deployment_staging.md`).
- ✅ Env/secret matrix published (`docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`) and production go-live checklist finalized (`docs/deployment/production_go_live_checklist.md`); both kept current.
- ✅ Postgres staging/test DB plan captured (`docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md`, `prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`); awaiting reliability to deliver connection credentials before QA can exercise migrations.
- ✅ Authored production environment setup playbook (`docs/deployment/production_environment_setup.md`) plus verification helper (`scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh`) to unblock reliability/admin execution; sent the link to reliability + repo admins (2025-10-09 09:40 ET) and awaiting acknowledgment.
- ⚠️ Production enablement still blocked by missing GitHub environment secrets, reviewer configuration, the Shopify CLI service token, and staging Postgres credentials.
- ⚠️ Localization requires a sanctioned Shopify embed token or approved host to capture modal screenshots; coordinating with reliability to supply the token and define storage/rotation before Playwright workflows resume (`docs/directions/localization.md:34`).

## Blockers / Requests

1. **Production secrets provisioning (Reliability — ETA 2025-10-09)** — Shopify, Supabase, Chatwoot, OpenAI, GA MCP secrets still pending in GitHub `production` environment; playbook shared with vault + `gh` steps, waiting on execution + vault references.
2. **Environment reviewers (Repo Admins — ETA 2025-10-09)** — Manager + reliability teams not yet enforced as required reviewers for GitHub `production`; instructions in playbook §3.
3. **Shopify CLI auth token (Deployment + Reliability — ETA 2025-10-09)** — Service credentials pending; once reliability delivers partner access we can generate `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_PROD` per playbook §2.
4. **Postgres staging credentials (Reliability — ETA 2025-10-09)** — Need staged Postgres connection strings to unblock QA rollback drills against `prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`.

## Next Actions (2025-10-09)

- Deliver playbook + new templates to reliability, repo admins, and QA; capture acknowledgements in this log.
- Sync with reliability on secret ETA (production secrets + Postgres staging creds) and ensure updates land in `feedback/reliability.md` with vault paths.
- Coordinate with repo admin on configuring `production` environment reviewers using the documented steps.
- Run `scripts/deploy/check-production-env.sh` after provisioning to confirm coverage; capture output + vault references in this log.
- Stage Shopify CLI token generation once service credentials arrive and log completion.
- Provide QA with Postgres staging connection info immediately after reliability handoff; schedule rollback drill dry run (target 2025-10-10) using the new checklist.

# Deployment Daily Status — 2025-10-07

## Summary

- ✅ Acknowledged manager direction (`docs/directions/deployment.md`) and assumed deployment agent responsibility.
- ✅ Stood up staging deploy workflow (`deploy-staging.yml`) with smoke verification + artifacts and published runbook support.
- ✅ Extended env matrix + `.env.example` for production readiness and logged reliability coordination for secret provisioning.
- ✅ Drafted production deployment workflow (`deploy-production.yml`) and CLI script covering smoke + Lighthouse evidence.
- ✅ Logged production secret tracker + smoke target (`docs/deployment/env_matrix.md`) and updated `.env.example`.
- ⚠️ Awaiting reliability to provision production secrets before enabling live runs.

## Risks / Follow-Ups

1. **Production Secrets Gap** — Reliability delivering GitHub environment `production` secrets by 2025-10-09; deployment to verify vault linkage once posted.
2. **Environment Approvals** — Need repo admins to configure GitHub `production` environment reviewers (manager + reliability) now that workflow enforcement is in place.
3. **CLI Auth Token** — Generate service `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_PROD` after reliability finalizes app credentials.

## Next Actions (2025-10-08)

- Confirm reliability updates `feedback/reliability.md` with secret provisioning evidence and vault paths.
- Coordinate with repo admin to enable environment reviewers for `production`.
- Generate service account Shopify CLI token and populate GitHub secret once credentials land.
