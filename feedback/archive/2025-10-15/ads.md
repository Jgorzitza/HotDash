# Feedback: ads ‚Äî 2025-10-15

## Startup (14:30 UTC)

### Status Check
- **Direction file:** `docs/directions/ads.md` reviewed
- **Status:** NOT ACTIVE
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Effective:** 2025-10-15

### Findings
1. ‚úÖ Direction file exists at `docs/directions/ads.md`
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No "Today's Objective" section** - Agent is in placeholder/inactive state
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Status explicitly marked as "NOT ACTIVE"
4. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Prerequisites listed: Dashboard foundation, analytics integration, approvals workflow
5. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Activation planned for: Milestone M5-M6 (Growth v1 + HITL posting)

### Alignment Check (per agent_startup_checklist.md step 0)
- ‚úÖ Reviewed `docs/NORTH_STAR.md` - Growth is integrated, not separate; follows same approvals loop
- ‚úÖ Reviewed `docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md` - Understand workflow pipeline and HITL requirements
- ‚úÖ Reviewed `docs/RULES.md` - Understand documentation policy, security, MCP-first approach
- ‚úÖ No conflicts detected between direction and governance docs

### Purpose (from direction file)
**Role:** Recommend ad campaigns, analyze ROAS, suggest budget adjustments with evidence

**When Active, I will:**
- Analyze advertising performance data (ROAS, CTR, conversion rates)
- Recommend ad campaign adjustments based on evidence
- Suggest budget allocations across channels
- Follow HITL approvals workflow (draft ‚Üí review ‚Üí approve ‚Üí apply)
- Use Google Analytics MCP and other analytics tools
- Provide evidence with every suggestion (queries, samples, projected impact)

### Current State
**Status:** INACTIVE - Awaiting foundation milestones

**Cannot execute because:**
- No "Today's Objective" section in direction file
- Prerequisites not yet complete:
  - Dashboard foundation (in progress by engineer agent)
  - Analytics integration (needs data/integrations agents)
  - Approvals workflow (needs engineer + integrations agents)

**Proper activation requires:**
- Manager to update `docs/directions/ads.md` with:
  - Section 15: "Today's Objective" with specific tasks
  - Linked GitHub Issue(s) with DoD and Allowed paths
  - Tools granted for the task
  - Constraints and deadlines

### Next Actions
Per agent startup checklist, when no objective is present:

1. ‚úÖ **Created feedback file** - `feedback/ads/2025-10-15.md` (this file)
2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Waiting for manager** to:
   - Complete prerequisite milestones (M1-M4)
   - Update direction file with "Today's Objective"
   - Create GitHub Issue(s) for ads agent work
   - Activate ads agent for M5-M6 milestone
3. üìã **Ready to execute** when activated with proper direction

### Blockers
- **BLOCKER:** No Today's Objective in direction file
- **BLOCKER:** Agent status is "NOT ACTIVE"
- **BLOCKER:** Prerequisites not complete (dashboard, analytics, approvals)

**Resolution:** Manager needs to activate agent with proper objective when prerequisites are met.

### Questions for Manager
1. What is the current milestone status? (Are we at M5-M6 yet?)
2. Are the prerequisites complete (dashboard foundation, analytics integration, approvals workflow)?
3. When should ads agent expect activation?
4. Should I prepare any planning documents while waiting?

### Time Log
- 14:30-14:45 UTC: Read direction file, agent startup checklist, governance docs
- 14:45-14:50 UTC: Created feedback file and documented status
