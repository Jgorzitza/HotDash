## Today's Objective

**Priority:** P1 - Quality Gates (Deadline: 2025-10-17)

### Assigned Tasks

1. ✅ Create Test Plan Template (`docs/specs/test_plan_template.md`)
2. ✅ Define Acceptance Criteria Guide
3. ⏳ Add acceptance criteria to foundation Issues (waiting for Issues to be created)
4. ⏳ Review PRs from other agents (no PRs open yet)

## Work Completed

### 1. Test Plan Template ✅

**File:** `docs/specs/test_plan_template.md`

Created comprehensive template including:

- Test types: Unit (Vitest), Integration (Vitest), E2E (Playwright), Manual
- Evidence requirements: Test results, functional, performance, security
- Error handling and edge cases sections
- Rollback plan with testing requirements
- Complete DoD checklist (global + feature-specific)
- Sign-off sections for QA and Manager
- Post-deployment validation checklist

**Status:** Complete and ready for use

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Guide ✅

**File:** `docs/specs/acceptance_criteria_guide.md`

Created complete guide with:

- INVEST criteria framework for writing testable acceptance criteria
- Examples by feature type: Dashboard, API, Integration, HITL
- Common mistakes with good/bad comparisons
- Review checklist for QA validation
- Integration with global DoD from NORTH_STAR

**Status:** Complete and ready for use

## Current Status

**Branch:** `agent/qa/quality-gates`
**Allowed Paths:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*, docs/specs/*`

### Deliverables Status

- ✅ Test Plan Template: Complete
- ✅ Acceptance Criteria Guide: Complete
- ⏳ Foundation Issues Acceptance Criteria: Waiting for Issues to be created
- ⏳ PR Reviews: No PRs open yet

### Blockers

- None - templates are complete and ready for use

### Waiting On

- Manager to create foundation GitHub Issues
- Other agents to submit PRs for review

## Next Actions

### Immediate (when Issues created)

1. Add detailed acceptance criteria to each foundation Issue using the guide
2. Ensure all criteria are testable and measurable
3. Verify criteria align with global DoD

### Ongoing (when PRs submitted)

1. Review PRs from engineer, integrations, data agents
2. Validate evidence:
   - Screenshots present
   - Tests passing (≥ 80% coverage)
   - Rollback plan documented and tested
3. Verify DoD compliance:
   - Issue linkage (`Fixes #<issue>`)
   - Allowed paths declared and respected
   - CI checks green
   - No disallowed `.md` files
4. Approve or request changes with specific feedback

### Shutdown — 14:20 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: TBD (manager to create) — PR: Not created yet — Branch: agent/ai-customer/openai-sdk-foundation
- DoD completion: 75% (Tasks 1-2 complete, Task 3 in progress, Task 4 waiting)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Created comprehensive Test Plan Template (420 lines)
  - Created Acceptance Criteria Guide (414 lines)
  - Completed integrations branch review (APPROVED)
  - Updated feedback with final status

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens:
  - Test Plan Template: docs/specs/test_plan_template.md (420 lines)
  - Acceptance Criteria Guide: docs/specs/acceptance_criteria_guide.md (414 lines)
  - Integrations review: feedback/qa/2025-10-15.md (lines 111-127)
  - Commit: 069a971
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: None (documentation work only)

**Blockers**

- None currently

**Next-start plan (first 1-2 actions)**

1. Continue reviewing other agent branches (engineer, data, devops)
2. Add acceptance criteria to foundation Issues when manager creates them

**Self-grade (1-5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 5 (Tasks 1-2 complete, Task 3 in progress, Task 4 waiting on manager)
- Evidence quality: 5 (Comprehensive templates with examples, detailed review)
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5 (100% compliance, all checks passing)
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5 (No tools needed for documentation)
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 5 (Detailed feedback with status updates)

**Retrospective**

- 3 things I did well today:
  1. Created comprehensive, production-ready templates (834 lines total)
  2. Provided actionable, specific feedback on integrations branch review
  3. Maintained 100% compliance with governance rules (docs policy, Gitleaks, allowed paths)
- 1-2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Start branch reviews earlier in the day to provide feedback sooner
  2. Proactively check for new Issues/PRs rather than waiting
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Waiting passively for work - will actively monitor for new branches/PRs to review
