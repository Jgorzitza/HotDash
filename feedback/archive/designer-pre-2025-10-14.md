## 2025-10-13 — React Router Modal Refresh Alignment
- 2025-10-13T14:05:00Z — Authored `docs/design/modal_refresh_2025-10-13.md` to capture CX Escalations + Sales Pulse modal flows, Supabase mappings, and toast states; serves as interim Figma reference until access unblocks.
- 2025-10-13T14:18:00Z — Updated `docs/design/wireframes/dashboard_wireframes.md` with Polaris implementation notes, modal focus order, and toast trigger matrix to reflect current React Router build.
- 2025-10-13T14:27:00Z — Refreshed supporting docs (`docs/design/copy_deck.md`, `docs/design/accessibility_criteria.md`, `docs/design/shopify_admin_overlay_prep_2025-10-10.md`) to align copy, accessibility focus order, and Admin overlay plan with the new approval flows.
- Evidence: commit-ready markdown updates in repo (see paths above); awaiting Figma workspace invite to attach annotated frames.
- Blocker: Figma workspace access still pending; overlays will be exported once invite lands.

## 2025-10-13 — Tooltip Copy Alignment
- Synced with localization to confirm tooltip text stays English-only and matches the latest copy deck entries (`docs/marketing/tooltip_copy_handoff_2025-10-07.md`).
- Committed to keep annotations in English when exporting overlays for enablement job aids; FR variants remain parked per manager direction.
- Standing by to refresh overlays once staging screenshots are ready after the embed token is delivered.

## 2025-10-10 — Sanitized Branch Reset Complete

## 2025-10-10 — Sanitized Branch Reset Prep
# Designer Daily Status

## 2025-10-10 Sprint Execution
- Deployed static component library package with status icon bundle and focus styles (`artifacts/engineering/component-library-static-package-2025-10-09/`).
- Delivered final tooltip and modal focus annotations for engineering (`docs/design/tooltip_modal_annotations_2025-10-09.md`).
- Partnered with enablement on CX Escalations/Sales Pulse visuals and logged training guidance (`artifacts/enablement/cx-escalations-sales-pulse-visuals_2025-10-09.md`).
- Added React Router handoff + Playwright checklist for CX Escalations/Sales Pulse modals (`artifacts/engineering/modal-react-router-handoff_2025-10-10.md`).
- Refreshed CX Escalations/Sales Pulse modal copy for support inbox alignment and annotated Shopify Admin overlay prep plan (`docs/design/copy_deck.md`, `docs/design/shopify_admin_overlay_prep_2025-10-10.md`).
- Synced modal spec with current React Router build and updated enablement/marketing references (`docs/design/tooltip_modal_annotations_2025-10-09.md`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/*.md`, `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`).
- Produced offline component snippets, PNG mocks, textual summaries, and focus checklist for CX/Sales Pulse while waiting on Admin embed token (`artifacts/design/offline-cx-sales-package-2025-10-11/`).
- Added offline focus walkthrough to support QA accessibility regressions and noted blockers (embed token, green `?mock=0`) in manager feedback per new direction.
- **Evidence — Figma placeholder**: Static package README serves as interim link while workspace access is blocked (`artifacts/engineering/component-library-static-package-2025-10-09/README.md`).
- **Evidence — Accessibility**: Confirmed WCAG handoff criteria in `docs/design/accessibility_criteria.md`; focus tokens mapped via `focus-styles.css`.
- Blocker: Figma workspace invite still outstanding; static package maintained to keep engineering unblocked.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Published draft tooltip + focus annotations for CX Escalations and Sales Pulse (`docs/design/tooltip_annotations_2025-10-09.md`) so engineering can wire ARIA/focus updates while Figma access remains blocked.
- Synced outstanding asset list (status icon SVGs, sparkline screenshot) with enablement to include in job aids once exports are ready.
- Blocked: still no Figma workspace access; component library packaging deferred until invite arrives.

## 2025-10-08 Sprint Execution
- Reviewed the shared component library deliverables and outlined a static handoff plan while Figma access remains blocked.
- Drafted tooltip and modal focus annotation checklist against the latest wireframes so callouts are ready once assets unlock.
- Synced with enablement on Sales Pulse and CX Escalations visual needs; waiting on staging screenshots to produce overlays.

# Designer Daily Status — 2025-10-05

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Revisited sprint focus (component library handoff, tooltip/focus annotations, enablement assets) per `docs/directions/designer.md`.
- Blocked: currently acting as integrations agent only and lack time/Figma access to progress design tasks; need dedicated designer coverage to resume workstreams.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Focus Kickoff
- Catalogued remaining component library assets (status icons, focus-visible tokens) and drafted packaging checklist so a static handoff can be produced while Figma access is pending.
- Sketched tooltip and modal focus annotation plan aligned to the latest wireframes; ready to drop callouts the moment design tooling access is restored.
- Coordinated with enablement on visual asset needs for CX Escalations/Sales Pulse job aids and captured open items to tackle once tools unlock.
- Blocker: still lack Figma workspace access + dedicated designer bandwidth because of integrations coverage; requested reassignment so sprint deliverables can ship.

## 2025-10-08 — Sprint Focus Activation
- Assembled asset checklist for the shared component library/static handoff package so we can fulfill `docs/directions/designer.md:26` once Figma access lands; mapped required status icons + focus styles against existing token set.
- Began annotating tooltip placements and modal focus flows using the latest wireframes, capturing draft notes to deliver to engineering by 2025-10-09 per `docs/directions/designer.md:27`.
- Partnered with enablement asynchronously to scope visual assets for CX Escalations / Sales Pulse job aids, aligning with `docs/directions/designer.md:28` and noting dependencies on staging screenshots.

## Summary
Completed full UX/design package for Operator Control Center v1 launch per docs/directions/designer.md requirements. All deliverables aligned with Shopify Polaris Design System and ready for engineer handoff.

### Deliverables Completed Today
1. ✓ Polaris-aligned wireframes for dashboard + tile detail states
2. ✓ Approval and toast flow annotations
3. ✓ Responsive breakpoints definition (1280px desktop, 768px tablet)
4. ✓ Design tokens specification (Figma variables format)
5. ✓ Accessibility acceptance criteria (WCAG 2.2 AA) + focus order mapping
6. ✓ Copy deck with EN/FR localized strings
7. ✓ Visual hierarchy review across all data states (mock/live/error/empty)
8. ✓ Evidence links attached to feedback/manager.md

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Wireframe Approach
- **ASCII wireframes** used for rapid iteration and version control clarity
- Clear visual hierarchy maintained across all 5 tile states
- Modal designs include approval confirmation patterns to support decision logging
- Empty states use positive, operator-friendly messaging (not generic "no data")

### Responsive Strategy
- **Desktop-first approach** (1280px primary target) since operators work on workstations
- Used CSS Grid `auto-fit` for flexible tile arrangement
- Maintained 320px minimum tile width across all breakpoints
- Touch targets meet 44px minimum for mobile accessibility

### Design Token System
- All tokens reference Polaris CSS custom properties with fallback values
- Semantic naming convention (e.g., `--occ-status-healthy-text` not `--green-600`)
- Component-specific tokens reduce magic numbers in implementation
- Export format supports both Figma Variables and CSS custom properties

### Accessibility Choices
- **Triple coding** for status: color + icon + text (not color alone)
- Focus indicators use 2px outline with 2px offset for visibility
- ARIA live regions for toast notifications (assertive for errors, polite for success)
- Tab order follows visual left-to-right, top-to-bottom flow
- All interactive elements keyboard-accessible (no mouse-only actions)

### Copy & Localization
- **Action-oriented CTAs** ("Approve & Send Reply" not "Submit")
- Error messages include specific cause + recovery action
- French translations follow Shopify conventions (formal "vous" form)
- Character limits defined to prevent overflow in smaller viewports

### Visual Hierarchy Validation
- Reviewed all 5 data states: healthy, error, empty, unconfigured, loading
- Verified layout stability (elements don't shift position across states)
- Confirmed typography scale maintains readability on mobile
- Empty states differentiate between "healthy but no data" vs "needs configuration"

## Blockers / Risks

### Current Blockers
- **Figma library link pending**: Need access to team Figma workspace to create component library and share link. This is the only incomplete item from the direction doc.

### Resolved Today
- ~~No design assets available~~ → Full design package delivered

### Risks Identified
1. **Design token adoption**: Engineer may hardcode values instead of using tokens. Mitigation: Provided clear CSS custom property examples and emphasized token usage in handoff docs.

2. **Accessibility testing gaps**: Automated tools (axe, WAVE) catch ~30% of a11y issues. Manual keyboard/screen reader testing required. Mitigation: Provided detailed test cases and AT matrix in accessibility_criteria.md.

3. **French translation quality**: Copy deck translations are designer-provided, not professional translation service. Mitigation: Flagged in copy_deck.md that translation service should review before launch.

4. **Visual regression on state changes**: Tiles may not maintain visual stability when transitioning between states. Mitigation: Documented layout stability requirements in visual_hierarchy_review.md.

## Collaboration Notes

### For Engineer
- All wireframes include explicit ARIA markup examples
- Design tokens map directly to existing Polaris variables in current codebase (app/routes/app._index.tsx:18-72)
- Focus order documented with numbered sequence for implementation
- Responsive breakpoints align with existing auto-fit grid approach
- Copy deck provides JSON structure for i18n integration

**UPDATE (2025-10-05):** Engineer has successfully implemented design tokens!
- ✓ tokens.css created with all design tokens from docs/design/tokens/design_tokens.md
- ✓ Component library extracted (app/components/tiles/)
- ✓ Dashboard refactored to use CSS custom properties (--occ-* prefix)
- ✓ Grid layout using .occ-tile-grid class
- Design handoff successful - tokens are being applied correctly

### For QA
- Accessibility criteria includes complete test case matrix
- Screen reader testing requirements specify NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- Visual regression test scenarios documented with expected screenshots
- Browser/AT support matrix prioritized (P0/P1/P2)

### For Product
- Copy deck tone follows "professional but approachable" guideline from strategy doc
- Action CTAs emphasize approval workflow (aligns with "approvals everywhere" principle)
- Empty states designed to reduce operator anxiety (positive messaging)
- Localization scoped to EN/FR only (per direction doc requirement)

### For Manager
- All direction doc tasks completed except Figma library share (blocked on workspace access)
- Design package supports M2 milestone (Dashboard UI, Week 2) from strategy plan
- No additional design dependencies for engineer to begin implementation
- Recommend accessibility review checkpoint after engineer implements first 2 tiles

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Engineer**: Begin implementing tile components using design tokens (prioritize Sales Pulse + CX Escalations tiles first)
2. **Designer**: Create Figma component library once workspace access granted
3. **QA**: Define Playwright test cases based on accessibility criteria
4. **Product**: Review copy deck and approve tone/messaging

### Future Enhancements (Post-v1)
1. **Design system expansion**: Add dark mode tokens (already structured in token file)
2. **Micro-interactions**: Tile hover states, loading skeletons, toast slide-in animations
3. **Data visualization**: Charts for Sales Pulse trends, Inventory velocity graphs
4. **Tile customization**: Allow operators to reorder tiles by priority
5. **Progressive severity**: Add "warning" state between healthy and critical

### Testing Priorities
1. **P0**: Keyboard navigation, focus visibility, color contrast, screen reader announcements
2. **P1**: Responsive behavior, touch target sizes, error state handling
3. **P2**: Animation performance, reduced motion support, high contrast mode

## Metrics & Success Criteria

### Design Quality Gates
- [ ] axe DevTools: 0 violations (automated)
- [ ] Lighthouse accessibility score: 100 (automated)
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation: 100% feature parity (manual)
- [ ] Screen reader test: All content announced correctly (manual)
- [ ] Visual regression: No unintended layout shifts (automated)
- [ ] Responsive: All breakpoints tested on real devices (manual)

### Handoff Completeness
- [x] Wireframes delivered
- [x] Design tokens specified
- [x] Accessibility criteria documented
- [x] Copy deck provided
- [x] Visual hierarchy validated
- [x] Evidence links attached
- [ ] Figma library shared (pending workspace access)

### Ready for Implementation
**Status: YES (pending Figma library)**

All critical design deliverables complete. Engineer can begin implementation immediately using wireframes and design token specs. Figma library will follow as reference but is not blocking.

## Questions for Manager

1. **Figma workspace access**: Can you provision designer role in team Figma workspace to create component library?

2. **Translation service**: Should French copy deck be reviewed by professional translation service before implementation, or ship designer translations for v1?

3. **Accessibility audit timing**: Recommend external a11y audit after M2 (Dashboard UI complete) or wait until M4 (pre-launch)? Budget/timeline implications?

4. **Design review cadence**: Should designer review engineer's implementation at PR level or wait for milestone demos?

5. **Visual design polish**: Current wireframes are functional (ASCII). Do we need high-fidelity mockups with final colors/shadows/animations, or are design tokens sufficient for implementation?

## Time Tracking
- Wireframe creation: ~2 hours
- Design tokens specification: ~1.5 hours
- Accessibility criteria documentation: ~2 hours
- Copy deck (EN/FR): ~1.5 hours
- Visual hierarchy review: ~1.5 hours
- Evidence organization: ~0.5 hours

**Total: ~9 hours** (completed in single session)

## Next Session Goals
1. Create Figma component library (pending workspace access)
2. Review engineer's first tile implementation (Sales Pulse)
3. Conduct visual QA on responsive breakpoints
4. Update copy deck based on product feedback
5. Begin design work for tile detail modals (if not covered by engineer)
