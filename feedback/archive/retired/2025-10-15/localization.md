### 4. Monday/Thursday Stack Compliance Audit

- Next audit dates: 2025-10-14 (Mon), 2025-10-17 (Thu)
- Focus areas:
  1. Supabase terminology across stack docs
  2. Chatwoot on Supabase references and macros alignment
  3. React Router 7 nomenclature and consistency
- Any remediation items will be logged here after each audit.

## 2025-10-11T04:47:30Z â€” Manager-updated tasks executed (RR7 + Shopify CLI v3; English-only audit)

- Actions:
  - Ran a repo-wide non-ASCII proxy check to reconfirm English-only compliance, focusing on shipping UI and Chatwoot templates.
  - Prepared Shopify Admin screenshot workflow per updated direction using `shopify app dev` (no token flows) and staged README for capture.
  - Will align collateral and partner tracker after manager review of findings.
- Artifacts:
  - UI scan summary: artifacts/localization/audits/20251011T044730Z/scan_ui.txt
  - Chatwoot scan summary: artifacts/localization/audits/20251011T044730Z/scan_chatwoot.txt
  - Screenshot prep: artifacts/localization/shopify/screenshots/20251011T044730Z/README.txt
- Notes:
  - The non-ASCII proxy flags typographic punctuation (e.g., en dash, curly quotes). No French strings identified in the UI or Chatwoot template paths; human review recommended at the listed line numbers to confirm.
  - Per updated direction, removed token-based screenshot workflow from the plan; using RR7 + Shopify CLI v3 instead.

## 2025-10-11T02:00:13Z â€” Localization audit kickoff (status: blocked, awaiting direction)

- Commands executed:
  - Attempt 1 (rg-based): bash -lc '<rg audit script creating artifacts dirs, sanctioned FR excludes, scans and drift checks>'
  - Attempt 2 (grep -P fallback): bash -lc '<grep-based audit script using scan_list helper and per-surface scans>'
- Output/evidence:
  - Artifacts summary: artifacts/localization/audits/2025-10-11T020013Z/status.md
  - Notes: ripgrep is not installed; both attempts encountered path expansion issues that caused writes to root (e.g., /scan\_\*.txt), leading to permission errors. No source files were modified; no secrets touched.
- Proposed next steps (awaiting manager approval):
  1. Install ripgrep and re-run a simplified, step-by-step scan (no eval, no functions) targeting UI/Chatwoot/Runbooks/Marketing, or
  2. Proceed with grep -P only in smaller, per-surface chunks, or
  3. Narrow initial scope to UI + Chatwoot scans, then expand.
- Blockers:
  - Shopify Admin screenshot workflow pending embed token delivery; prep folders will be created after scans succeed.
- Request:
  - Please advise which option to proceed with, and whether to install ripgrep on this workstation.
