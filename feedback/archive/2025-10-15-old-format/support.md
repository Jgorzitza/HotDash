**Source:** Lines 31-39 of support direction - ongoing operational responsibilities
**Status:** Moving to proactive operational support tasks

### 🎯 NEXT TASK PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED

Based on core support direction responsibilities, next tasks:

**Task 1: Daily Chatwoot Template Review** (Line 32)
- **Responsibility:** "Ensure Chatwoot templates stay current; review daily with AI/engineer"
- **Action:** Review current templates against recent conversations and AI suggestions
- **Evidence:** Log updates in Memory (scope `ops`)

**Task 2: Integration Health Monitoring** (Line 35)

### 🔄 STARTING WITH TASK 1: DAILY TEMPLATE REVIEW

**Next Action:** Begin proactive daily Chatwoot template review per direction line 32.


## 2025-10-11T03:35Z - Daily Chatwoot Template Review (Task 1)
**Task:** Daily template review per direction line 32 - "Ensure Chatwoot templates stay current"
**Status:** ✅ REVIEW COMPLETE - Analysis of current templates vs AI suggestions
**Command:** Reviewed templates, CX escalations runbook scenarios, Memory logs

### 📊 CURRENT TEMPLATE ANALYSIS

**Templates in Production:** 3 active templates
1. **ack_delay** - General inquiry/delay acknowledgment
2. **ship_update** - Shipping delay response
3. **refund_offer** - Return/refund scenarios

**AI Suggestion Patterns:** From CX escalations runbook scenarios:
- AI suggestions currently align well with existing templates
- ship_update template matches AI suggestions for shipping delays
- refund_offer template matches AI suggestions for product issues  
- ack_delay template used as fallback for general inquiries

### 🎯 TEMPLATE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED

**Gap Analysis:** Based on runbook line 283 action item "Expand template library/AI suggestions beyond ack_delay"

**Potential New Templates:**
1. **Order Status Template** - More specific than general ack_delay
   - Use case: "My order still says processing"
   - Suggested body: "Hi {{name}}, I can see your order is currently processing. Let me get you a specific status update right now."

2. **Follow-up Template** - For promised check-ins
   - Use case: After initial ack_delay response 
   - Suggested body: "Hi {{name}}, following up on your order inquiry. I've confirmed [specific update] and your order should [next step]."

3. **Policy Exception Template** - For escalation scenarios
   - Use case: When standard templates don't fit
   - Suggested body: "Hi {{name}}, I understand your concern about this situation. Let me connect you with our manager who can review your specific case."

### 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AI/ENGINEER COORDINATION

**Next Actions per Direction:**
1. **Coordinate with AI team** on template expansion priorities
2. **Partner with Engineer** on template implementation and testing
3. **Log template updates** in Memory (scope `ops`) when changes are made

### 📋 MEMORY LOG ENTRY REQUIRED

### 🔍 IDENTIFIED GAPS & OPERATOR PAIN POINTS

**Category 1: User Experience & Clarity Issues**
1. **SLA Breach Confusion** (High Priority)
   - **Issue:** "Conversation shows 'SLA breached' but was already replied to"
   - **Root Cause:** Breach timestamp calculated from creation, not last reply
   - **Impact:** Operator confusion leads to inefficient workflow
   - **Product Gap:** UI doesn't clearly indicate breach calculation method

2. **Template Variable Fallbacks** (Medium Priority)  
   - **Issue:** "Template variable {{name}} shows 'Customer' instead of real name"
   - **Root Cause:** Incomplete Chatwoot contact data
   - **Impact:** Less personalized customer interactions
   - **Product Gap:** No automatic name resolution or inline editing

3. **Decision Log Visibility** (Medium Priority)
   - **Issue:** "Decision log not showing after clicking 'Send Reply'"
   - **Root Cause:** Console errors or async issues
   - **Impact:** Reduced operator confidence, audit trail concerns  
   - **Product Gap:** No real-time feedback on decision logging success

**Category 2: Feature Expansion Needs**
4. **Template Library Limitations** (High Priority)
   - **Issue:** Only 3 templates available, AI suggestions limited to ack_delay fallback
   - **Evidence:** CX escalations runbook line 283 action item "Expand template library/AI suggestions beyond ack_delay"
   - **Impact:** Generic responses, missed personalization opportunities
   - **Product Gap:** Need order_status, follow_up, policy_exception templates
