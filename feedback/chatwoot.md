## 2025-10-11 03:19 UTC — Auto-Run Preflight and DSN Alignment Attempts

Status: Executing manager direction (local, non-interactive) with evidence capture. Target: align Supabase DSN and complete migrations.

Artifacts root: artifacts/integrations/chatwoot-fly-deployment-2025-10-11T03:19:56Z/

Commands executed (outputs in artifacts):
- mkdir -p artifacts/.../{logs,cmds,assets}
  - session log → artifacts/integrations/chatwoot-fly-deployment-2025-10-11T03:19:56Z/logs/session.txt
- Vault presence check
  - PRESENT: vault/occ/fly/api_token.env; vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env; vault/occ/chatwoot/redis_staging.env
  - preflight → logs/preflight.txt
- Fly auth
  - fly auth whoami → logs/fly_whoami.txt (jgorzitza@outlook.com)
- Fly secrets alignment
  - Parsed DATABASE_URL → POSTGRES_*; set POSTGRES_*, REDIS_URL, FRONTEND_URL, BACKEND_URL (values redacted) → logs/fly_secrets_set_postgres_redis.txt
- Memory scaling (per direction)
  - fly scale memory 2048 -g web; -g worker → logs/fly_scale_memory.txt
- Health probe
  - curl https://hotdash-chatwoot.fly.dev/api → 200; /hc → 404 → logs/health_probes.txt
- Migration attempt #1
  - fly ssh console -C 'bundle exec rails db:chatwoot_prepare' → FATAL: MaxClientsInSessionMode (pgBouncer session pool limit) → logs/rails_db_prepare.txt
- Remediation step
  - scale worker to 0 (free DB connections) → logs/fly_scale_count.txt
  - set SECRET_KEY_BASE via secrets import file (redacted) → logs/fly_secrets_import_secret_key_base.txt
- Migration attempt #2
  - fly ssh console -C 'bundle exec rails db:chatwoot_prepare' → FATAL: MaxClientsInSessionMode → logs/rails_db_prepare.txt (appended)
- Restored worker scale to 1 for service continuity → logs/fly_scale_count.txt

Blocker observed (x2 attempts):
- Supabase session pooler returning "MaxClientsInSessionMode: max clients reached" during migration. Likely due to active connections held by the web process + pool size constraints.

Proposed next steps (require manager/deployment coordination):
1) Provide a direct Postgres DSN (non-pooler) for maintenance/migrations only, or increase session pool size temporarily.
2) Approve a brief maintenance window to stop the web machine, run a one-off migration machine (chatwoot/chatwoot:latest) attached to the app with secrets, then restore both processes.
3) Alternatively, confirm Supabase transaction pooler DSN for migrations (if supported by Chatwoot migrations) with connection_limit=1.

I will proceed with non-disruptive tasks (e.g., readiness docs, smoke script prep) while awaiting approval/instructions on the migration path.

<!-- Log new updates below. Include timestamp, command/output, and evidence path. -->

## 2025-10-11 01:12 UTC - Chatwoot Readiness Documentation Created
**Action:** Created comprehensive Chatwoot production readiness tracking document
**File:** `docs/integrations/chatwoot_readiness.md` (105 lines)
**Content:** Production credential requirements, Support coordination plan, readiness checklist, current blockers analysis
**Next Steps:** Address Supabase DSN alignment, coordinate with Support team for inbox scopes, begin API token generation process
**Evidence:** Full readiness tracking matrix with 10-item checklist and Support coordination requirements

## 2025-10-11 01:37 UTC - Chatwoot Direction Review and Ready-for-Execution
Status: Reviewed manager direction and linked canon. Prepared evidence scaffolding and execution plan; awaiting manager alignment before running preflight.

Commands executed (evidence captured):
- git --no-pager rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD → artifacts/integrations/chatwoot-manager-feedback-2025-10-11T01:37:42Z/git_branch.txt
- git --no-pager status -sb → artifacts/integrations/chatwoot-manager-feedback-2025-10-11T01:37:42Z/git_status.txt

Artifacts & references:
- Artifact root: artifacts/integrations/chatwoot-manager-feedback-2025-10-11T01:37:42Z/
- Reviewed docs list: artifacts/integrations/chatwoot-manager-feedback-2025-10-11T01:37:42Z/reviewed_docs.txt
- Direction: docs/directions/chatwoot.md
- Runbook: docs/deployment/chatwoot_fly_runbook.md
- Governance & credentials: docs/directions/README.md, docs/ops/credential_index.md
- Deploy config: deploy/chatwoot/fly.toml; Client: packages/integrations/chatwoot.ts

Planned next actions (pending manager OK):
1) Preflight + evidence scaffolding per runbook; verify Fly auth and toolchain
2) Supabase DSN alignment and Fly secrets refresh (Supabase-only; no Fly Postgres)
3) Redeploy; run db:chatwoot_prepare, create_redis_keys, and super admin; verify health endpoint
4) Coordinate inbound email for customer.support@hotrodan.com; configure webhook to Supabase; generate scoped API token
5) Run scripts/ops/chatwoot-fly-smoke.sh and update readiness dashboard; log all evidence

Asks/clarifications for manager:
- Confirm vault files are present locally: vault/occ/fly/api_token.env, vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env, vault/occ/chatwoot/redis_staging.env
- Approve aligning Fly http_checks path to /hc if routes confirm that endpoint (current config shows /api)
- Preference for inbound email integration (IMAP/SMTP vs provider API) and contact for Support handoff
- Confirm Data-provided Supabase webhook endpoint and secret path

Ready state: On approval, will begin preflight and halt if any credentials are missing; all steps will be logged with commands and artifact paths as required by direction.
