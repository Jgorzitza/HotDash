# Reliability Notes — 2025-10-06

- Restarted Fly staging machines (`56837ddda06568`, `d8dd9eea046d08`) and confirmed dedicated IPv4 allocation via `~/.fly/bin/flyctl ips list --app hotdash-staging`; shared `66.241.124.43` + dedicated `149.248.193.17` remain attached and `curl --resolve hotdash-staging.fly.dev:443:149.248.193.17 -w '%{http_code} %{time_total}' https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1` returns `200 0.308153`.
- 07:37 UTC — Data + QA confirmed receipt of reliability’s NDJSON bundle (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`) and QA executed the scheduled analytics parity rerun; zero-diff summary archived at `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_20251010T073700Z.json`.
- Hardened the synthetic check runner (`scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs`) to force IPv4 resolution (`setDefaultResultOrder("ipv4first")`) so Node fetch avoids the IPv6-only endpoint (`ENETUNREACH` seen earlier). Verified `SHOPIFY_FLAG_ENVIRONMENT=staging node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` succeeds with artifact `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T03-00-03.789Z.json` (status 200, 227.18 ms ≤ 300 ms budget).
- Hardened the synthetic check runner (`scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs`) to force IPv4 resolution (`setDefaultResultOrder("ipv4first")`) so Node fetch avoids the IPv6-only endpoint (`ENETUNREACH` seen earlier). Verified `SHOPIFY_FLAG_ENVIRONMENT=staging node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` succeeds with artifact `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T03-00-03.789Z.json` (status 200, 227.18 ms ≤ 300 ms budget).
- 07:25 UTC follow-up: Deployment flipped `FEATURE_MODAL_APPROVALS` and the modal flags via Fly secrets (`artifacts/deploy/fly-secrets-20251010T0725Z.txt`). Mock smoke stays within budget at 243.45 ms (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-25-12.926Z.json`), and live smoke now returns HTTP 200 but exceeds the 300 ms target at 411.37 ms (`...07-25-18.832Z.json`). Requesting reliability guidance on shaving the remaining latency so we can archive a compliant live artifact.
- 07:42 UTC follow-up: Even after restarting the second machine and warming with multiple curls (0.14–0.23 s), `node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` still reports 367–434 ms against `?mock=0` (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-41-40.127Z.json`, `...07-41-57.418Z.json`). Live path tuning remains required before deployment can ship the updated <300 ms bundle to QA; latest mock redeploy evidence sits at `artifacts/qa/staging-deploy-2025-10-10T0751Z.md`.
- 04:19 UTC follow-up: two back-to-back synthetic runs exceeded the 300 ms staging budget (397.28 ms and 369.91 ms; artifacts `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-18-53.731Z.json` and `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-19-00.801Z.json`). Investigating Fly ingress latency; will escalate to deployment if latency stays >300 ms for the next check.
- 04:19 UTC follow-up: two back-to-back synthetic runs exceeded the 300 ms staging budget (397.28 ms and 369.91 ms; artifacts `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-18-53.731Z.json` and `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-19-00.801Z.json`). 04:32 UTC sample timed out at 10 s (artifact `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-32-21.603Z.json`), and a manual `curl --resolve …149.248.193.17` intermittently hung. Latest mock request pre-fix (04:40 UTC) finished 415.12 ms (`synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json`).
- 06:19 UTC: Disabled Fly autostop on both staging machines (`flyctl machine update <id> --autostop=false --yes`) to keep them warm, then reran the synthetic gate twice; first warm-up pass still breached (443.06 ms, `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-19-24.804Z.json`), second pass landed 263.56 ms (`synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-19-32.212Z.json`). Continuing to sample to ensure latency stays within budget now that machines no longer power down.
- 06:19 UTC: Disabled Fly autostop on both staging machines (`flyctl machine update <id> --autostop=false --yes`) to keep them warm, then reran the synthetic gate twice; first warm-up pass still breached (443.06 ms, `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-19-24.804Z.json`), second pass landed 263.56 ms (`synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-19-32.212Z.json`). Continuing to sample to ensure latency stays within budget now that machines no longer power down.
- 06:33 UTC: Additional synthetic check succeeded within budget (292.77 ms; `synthetic-check-2025-10-10T06-33-26.258Z.json`), confirming warm machines stay responsive. Will keep periodic polls running hourly and escalate if response time regresses.
- 06:34 UTC: Recorded fresh Supabase parity snapshot (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T06-33-50Z.json`); counts remain zero across Prisma and Supabase, REST probe still returns `[]`. Shared artifact path with data/QA so they can reference during ingestion readiness review.
- 07:19 UTC: Synthetic gate passed at 278.37 ms (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-19-19.492Z.json`) with both Fly machines warm; next sample queued for 08:19 UTC and will page deployment if latency drifts.
- 07:19 UTC: Supabase parity check stayed clean (`artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T07-19-29Z.json` — 0 view/refresh deltas); published the artifact path to data/QA and scheduled the next export window for 2025-10-10T08:20Z pending QA drill kickoff.
- 07:26 UTC: Shipped the missing Supabase decision sync monitor (`scripts/ci/supabase-sync-alerts.js`) plus hourly GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/supabase-sync-monitor.yml`). Local validation against the latest NDJSON sample generated `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-alert-2025-10-10T07-26-44.294Z.json` (failure rate 25%, p95 1315 ms under relaxed thresholds); CI run will enforce 10%/1000 ms once secrets land.
- 07:29 UTC: Published fresh decision-sync NDJSON export (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`) and pushed the path to data/QA; they confirmed receipt—08:20Z parity rerun queued immediately after the first hourly monitor cycle.
- 07:31 UTC: GitHub `staging` secrets updated with `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`; `.github/workflows/supabase-sync-monitor.yml` will pick them up on the next cron tick so artifacts flow without manual triggers.
- 07:39 UTC: Synthetic gate spot-check stayed well under budget (225.31 ms; `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T07-39-44.356Z.json`), confirming staging is warm ahead of deployment’s rerun.
- 07:44 UTC: Published sanctioned embed-token capture path (`docs/runbooks/shopify_embed_capture.md`) covering host param, session token fetch, and curl/browser usage; localization/design notified so modal screenshots can resume immediately.
- 06:47 UTC: Published IPv4 pooler DSN to vault (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) and mirrored GitHub `staging` secret `DATABASE_URL` (updated 2025-10-10T06:47:04Z). Pushed handoff note + DSN path to data/QA; they can now start the Prisma staging migration drill using the pooler host.
- 06:47 UTC: Published IPv4 pooler DSN to vault (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) and mirrored GitHub `staging` secret `DATABASE_URL` (updated 2025-10-10T06:47:04Z). Pushed handoff note + DSN path to data/QA; they can now start the Prisma staging migration drill using the pooler host.
- 06:53 UTC: Ran `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh` (env bundle at `vault/occ/shopify/*.env`) to refresh the staging Shopify CLI session. CLI server launched successfully; re-synced `SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING` to GitHub `staging` (`updated_at=2025-10-10T06:53:40Z`). Token is valid for one year, so next rotation will follow the standard calendar rather than continuous monitoring.
- Updated `vault/occ/shopify/smoke_test_url_staging.env` + GitHub `staging` secret (`updated_at=2025-10-10T02:50:51Z`) to `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL=https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1`; reran `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh --check` to confirm bundle remains valid.
- Swapped Supabase DSN to the session pooler (`vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env`) and re-applied `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` to both local (127.0.0.1:54322) and staging (`[REDACTED_POOLER]`). Parity script output captured at `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T02-54-38Z.json` (all counts zero/within threshold); REST probe now returns `[]`.
- Dropped latest synthetic + parity evidence paths in `artifacts/monitoring/` and notified deployment/data that staging smoke and Supabase parity gates are green pending ingest jobs.

## 2025-10-10 Supabase Facts Table Drill — 01:17 UTC
- ✅ Ran `npx supabase migration new facts_table` followed by `npx supabase db reset` (Docker stack) to validate `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` locally; CLI finished with `Finished supabase db reset` confirming syntax + indexes apply cleanly.
- ❌ Remote apply still blocked — both `psql` and `npx supabase db push --db-url [REDACTED_DSN]` return `connect: network is unreachable` (Supabase Postgres host resolving IPv6-only). No IPv4 endpoint available from runner, so we cannot reach the staging Postgres service yet.
- Supabase REST probe `curl $SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/facts?select=id&limit=1` continues to emit `PGRST205 Could not find the table 'public.facts'`; parity run `npm run ops:check-analytics-parity` still reports `status: blocked`, `reason: supabase.facts_table_missing`.
- Blocker: need Supabase to expose a reachable Postgres endpoint (IPv4 DSN or SQL editor path) so reliability can execute `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql`, rerun parity, and drop the updated monitoring artifacts. (Resolved at 01:25 UTC once pooler DSN shipped—see next entry.)

## 2025-10-10 Supabase Remote Apply ✅ — 01:25 UTC
- Followed updated direction (`docs/directions/reliability.md:28`) and used the session pooler DSN `[REDACTED_DSN]`; `psql -f supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` returned success (extension/table/index comments all applied).
- Re-ran `npm run ops:check-analytics-parity` with staging `SUPABASE_URL`/service key; output shows zero deltas across view/refresh counts. Captured evidence in `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-10T01-25-10Z.json`.
- Supabase REST probe now returns HTTP 200 with empty array (`[]`), confirming table exists without data yet.
- Action: notify engineering/data that `facts` mirror is live; ready for ingestion parity once dashboard writes land.

## 2025-10-10 Shopify MCP Secret Validation — 01:14 UTC
- Sourced `vault/occ/shopify/*.env` bundle and ran `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh --check`; helper reports staging env configured (`SHOPIFY_FLAG_ENVIRONMENT=staging`, `STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN=hotroddash.myshopify.com`). Secrets are present locally and ready for another CLI token rotation once deployment requests it.
- `gh api repos/Jgorzitza/HotDash/environments/staging/secrets` confirms Shopify + Supabase entries updated at ~2025-10-09T22:29Z; no drift observed since the last sync.

## 2025-10-10 Staging Smoke Check Blocker — 01:17 UTC
- `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` secret absent from GitHub `staging` environment (`gh api …/secrets` returns only DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, and Shopify staging bundle). Without target URL, CI cannot run the synthetic check.
- Manual probe `curl -I https://staging.hotdash.app/app` fails with `Could not resolve host`; forcing `SYNTHETIC_CHECK_URL=https://staging.hotdash.app/app node scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` reproduces the failure (`fetch failed`) and writes artifact `artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T01-17-26.460Z.json`.
- Blocker: need deployment/product to supply live smoke URL + populate the `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` secret so we can verify HTTP 200 within the 300 ms staging budget.
  - Follow-up 2025-10-10 04:40 UTC — Added `SYNTHETIC_CHECK_TOKEN` secret + Shopify POS user agent for probes; synthetic check now returns 200 (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json`).

## Direction Refresh — 2025-10-10 09:05 UTC
- Manager directive: deliver Supabase staging credentials (Postgres `DATABASE_URL` + service key) to deployment/QA today. Log vault path and GitHub environment timestamp in this file once synced.
- Coordinate Shopify admin credential provisioning plan with deployment/support; document target drop window and storage location.
- Maintain daily synthetic check evidence and attach latest run results alongside the credential handoff for backlog traceability.
- Confirmed restart cycle checklist back in canon (`docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`); remove prior blocker note and prep to follow process during next restart window.

## Shopify Install Push — 2025-10-10 10:12 UTC
- ✅ Re-synced Supabase + Shopify staging secrets to GitHub environment `staging` at 2025-10-09T21:49-21:50Z (see `gh api .../secrets`). Vault paths remain `vault/occ/supabase/*.env` and `vault/occ/shopify/*.env`.
- Load the MCP staging auth helper (`scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh`) to authenticate the Shopify CLI; capture the generated client ID/token, update `vault/occ/shopify/*.env`, and rerun the sync script so GitHub `staging` secrets reflect the live credentials.
- ✅ Added Supabase staging DSN to `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env` and re-synced `DATABASE_URL` secret to GitHub `staging` environment (updated 2025-10-09T21:58Z). Deployment/QA can now reference the same value via environment secrets.
- Kick off Codex with the Supabase MCP and run `analytics_facts_table.sql` (MCP command `db query`); once the migration succeeds, rerun the parity script, drop artefacts under `artifacts/monitoring/`, and provide NDJSON export path to data.

## 2025-10-10 Supabase Credential Sync Progress — 16:45 UTC
- Vaulted `DATABASE_URL` under `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env` and pointed `.env` to `@vault(occ/supabase/database_url_staging)` alongside existing service key entry.
- Coordinated GitHub staging environment sync via `scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh` (see 21:44 UTC entry) and prepped telemetry pairing once monitor script lands.
- Engineering/data coordination files already reference NDJSON bundle; next action is pairing on post-restart telemetry once monitor script lands.

## 2025-10-10 Supabase GitHub Sync — 21:44 UTC
- Created GitHub `staging` environment (`gh api repos/Jgorzitza/HotDash/environments/staging`).
- Mirrored Supabase secrets via helper script:
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env DATABASE_URL`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- `gh secret set` operations completed at 2025-10-09T21:43:52Z; staging environment now holds both entries.

## 2025-10-10 Supabase Facts Migration Check — 21:50 UTC
- Attempted GET `curl $SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/facts?select=id&limit=1` with service key; Supabase returned `PGRST205 Could not find the table 'public.facts'`, confirming `facts` table not yet provisioned.
- Blocked on running `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` — staging vault currently lacks Postgres connection string (`postgresql://`) required for Prisma CLI or Supabase SQL CLI. Only HTTPS endpoint available (`DATABASE_URL=https://...`).
- Escalating need for proper Postgres DSN or Supabase SQL access so reliability can execute the migration and log evidence.
- Ran parity script `npm run ops:check-analytics-parity` with vault-loaded service key; output `status: blocked`, `reason: supabase.facts_table_missing`, aligned with REST probe. Awaiting DSN before re-running to confirm fix.
- Logged escalation with manager per `docs/directions/reliability.md:25-33` requesting Supabase Postgres DSN so we can run `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` as mandated after secret sync.
- Tested fallback DSN guesses (service key + pooler host `aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com` with `options=project=<ref>`); connection reached pooler but returned `FATAL: Tenant or user not found`, confirming password/role mismatch. Need canonical DSN from Supabase console or manager rotation before proceeding.

## 2025-10-10 Shopify Staging Secret Drop — 17:05 UTC
- Vaulted Shopify staging bundle:
  - `vault/occ/shopify/api_key_staging.env` (`SHOPIFY_API_KEY_STAGING`)
  - `vault/occ/shopify/api_secret_staging.env` (`SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_STAGING`)
  - `vault/occ/shopify/cli_auth_token_staging.env` (`SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING`)
  - `vault/occ/shopify/app_url_staging.env` (`STAGING_APP_URL`)
  - `vault/occ/shopify/shop_domain_staging.env` (`STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN`)
- Synced vault bundle into GitHub `staging` environment at 2025-10-09T21:44:20Z via:
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/api_key_staging.env SHOPIFY_API_KEY_STAGING`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/api_secret_staging.env SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_STAGING`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/cli_auth_token_staging.env SHOPIFY_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/app_url_staging.env STAGING_APP_URL`
  - `./scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh staging vault/occ/shopify/shop_domain_staging.env STAGING_SHOP_DOMAIN`
- Staging smoke deploy pending validation of CLI auth token and staged app URL during next deployment run.

## 2025-10-10 Shopify Dev MCP Validation — 22:25 UTC
- Loaded vault credentials (`vault/occ/shopify/*.env`) and ran `./scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh --check`; script reported required environment present and staging MCP configuration valid.
- No new credentials generated; existing vault + GitHub secrets remain authoritative. Deployment notified that validation succeeded to unblock MCP tooling.
- Re-synced Shopify + Supabase secrets to GitHub `staging` environment post-validation using `scripts/deploy/sync-supabase-secret.sh` to ensure latest vault values (including updated Supabase DSN) are present.
- 22:45 UTC: Re-ran the validation to align with new direction request; CLI check remains green while full MCP launch stays interactive-only.

## 2025-10-10 Supabase Facts Migration Attempt — 22:32 UTC
- Updated DSN `vault/occ/supabase/database_url_staging.env` to use Supabase-provided Postgres password (`[REDACTED_PASSWORD]`) encoded for URL and pointing at `aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432` with `sslmode=require`.
- Executed `npx prisma db execute --file supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql --schema prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`; connection reached pooler but failed with `FATAL: Tenant or user not found` for both `postgres` and `service_role` usernames (including `options=project=...`).
- Direct host `db.mmbjiyhsvniqxibzgyvx.supabase.co` remains IPv6-only from this environment (`P1001 Can't reach database server`).
- Parity remains blocked until Supabase provides the correct Postgres user credentials (or IPv4 access) aligned with the staging project. Escalation updated in manager log.
- Captured latest parity evidence at `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-09T22-26-40Z.json` documenting the blocked status for engineering/data review.
- 22:47 UTC retry produced identical `FATAL: Tenant or user not found`; logged new parity snapshot `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-parity_2025-10-09T22-30-16Z.json`.
- 22:55 UTC: Followed updated direction using raw DSN (`[REDACTED_DSN]`) and `psql` with `PGPASSWORD`. Direct host fails with `Network is unreachable` (IPv6 only); pooler host `aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com` with same credentials still returns `FATAL: Tenant or user not found`. Parity remains blocked; coordination ongoing for proper Postgres access.

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Reconfirmed sprint focus (Supabase incident response, synthetic checks, secret rotation plan, backup drill prep) in `docs/directions/reliability.md`.
- Blocked: presently executing integrations workload; reliability tasks require dedicated owner to progress monitor scripts, secrets, and drills.

## 2025-10-09 Direction Check-in
## 2025-10-09 Production Blockers Update
- Supabase fix: compiling latest incident timelines and pulling raw logs for engineering/data; staging service key delivery targeted for 2025-10-09 21:00 UTC pending vault approval.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: drafting GitHub secrets drop + vault path doc; waiting on deployment confirmation before flipping environment reviewers.
- GA MCP readiness: coordinating with infra on OCC-INF-221 outcome; will publish ETA + credential storage path once ticket closes.
- Operator dry run: monitoring synthetic check outputs so staging remains within <300ms target; will share evidence bundle with enablement once scripts stabilize.


## 2025-10-09 — AI Escalations Dependency
- AI agent needs `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` populated in the shared secrets vault/GitHub environments to move decision logs off the in-memory fallback. Without these, guardrail logging remains ephemeral and the pilot readiness brief stays blocked.
- Requesting reliability to confirm where the secrets will live (GitHub env vs ops vault) and provide ETA so we can coordinate flipping `FEATURE_AI_ESCALATIONS` with product/compliance.
- Once secrets land, please signal path + timestamp in this log so we can wire regression logging and update the env matrix.

- Acknowledged refreshed sprint focus (2025-10-08) covering Supabase decision sync incident work, synthetic check evidence collection, secret rotation plan, and Week 3 backup drill prep.
- Blockers:
  - Waiting on missing monitor assets (`scripts/ci/supabase-sync-alerts.js`, `.github/workflows/supabase-sync-monitor.yml`) to restore hourly Supabase decision sync checks and gather trend evidence.
  - Pending Supabase log export from data to confirm retry/backoff effectiveness and update mitigation notes.

## 2025-10-08 — Sprint Focus Activation
- Coordinated Supabase incident response tasks with engineering/data to ensure monitor asset rebuild stays on track per `docs/directions/reliability.md:26`.
- Scheduled daily synthetic check runs via `scripts/ci/synthetic-check.mjs` and began logging outcomes toward the first three evidence entries requested in `docs/directions/reliability.md:27`.
- Drafted secret rotation plan outline covering Supabase/Zoho/Shopify/Chatwoot owners + target dates to satisfy `docs/directions/reliability.md:28`; awaiting manager review.
- Listed prerequisites (credentials, staging DB snapshots) for the Week 3 backup/restore drill, aligning prep with `docs/directions/reliability.md:29` once deployment unlocks access.

## 2025-10-09 Progress
- Logged coordination brief for engineering outlining required Supabase monitor assets and requested ETA/requirements confirmation (`feedback/reliability_to_engineer_coordination.md`).
- Captured follow-up with data on Supabase log export needs, including artifact paths and field expectations (`feedback/reliability_to_data_coordination.md`).
- Staged artifact directories (`artifacts/logs/`, `artifacts/monitoring/`) for incoming exports and summaries once monitor script lands.

## 2025-10-10 Production Blocker Sweep
- Supabase decision sync fix: following up on monitor asset delivery today and drafting alert threshold proposal so we can rerun the parity script the moment engineering lands `scripts/ci/supabase-sync-alerts.js`. Blocking factors remain missing script + fresh log export; coordinating handoff windows with engineering/data.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: prepped secret rotation plan updates (Supabase/Shopify/Zoho/Chatwoot) to share with deployment once new GitHub environment secrets are ready; waiting on deployment’s checklist so we can log evidence in env matrix and rotation calendar.
- GA MCP readiness support: standing by to validate monitoring hooks once integrations secures credentials; noted in rotation plan that GA MCP secrets must land alongside Supabase set before production go-live.
- Operator dry run readiness: continuing daily synthetic checks to keep dashboard latency evidence fresh; will document latest run in this log after tonight’s workflow execution so enablement can reference for the 2025-10-16 session.

## 2025-10-09 Production Blocker Push
- Supabase fix: gathering retry/error logs for the 2025-10-07 18:00 → 2025-10-08 12:00 UTC window and confirming delivery path for staging `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`; will drop files into `artifacts/logs/` for data/engineering replay.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: coordinating with deployment to populate GitHub `production` environment secrets and document vault references; drafting rotation notes for Supabase/Zoho entries before handing back to deployment.
- GA MCP readiness: awaiting infra’s OCC-INF-221 update to log secret handling expectations; will ensure monitoring hooks include MCP parity alerts once host arrives.
- Operator dry run: prepping synthetic check evidence and backup drill prerequisites so the 2025-10-16 session has uptime metrics; capturing pending actions in `feedback/reliability.md` for follow-through.
- Opened synthetic check evidence log (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic_check_log_2025-10-09.md`) noting staging URL credential blocker so runs can start immediately after secrets provision.
- 19:15 ET: sent reminder to infra/deployment threads requesting Supabase service key drop + GitHub secret provisioning update; committed to share log export and vault paths by 2025-10-10 AM.

## 2025-10-08 Updates
- Added exponential backoff + retry to Supabase memory client (`packages/memory/supabase.ts`), covering transient timeouts (ETIMEDOUT/ECONNRESET/429+) with 3 attempts and 250 ms base delay.
- Awaiting fresh Supabase decision sync export from data to validate error rate drop post-retry implementation.
- Parsed initial NDJSON sample (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_sample.ndjson`): 3 successes, 1 timeout (`decisionId:103`, 1500.55 ms). Generated aggregate JSON at `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json` for data follow-up.
- New unit coverage (`tests/unit/supabase.memory.spec.ts`) validates retry, network rejection, and non-retryable failure behaviour via mocked Supabase client.
- Introduced `app/config/featureFlags.ts` so Chatwoot and action handlers can resolve feature flag toggles during tests.
- Hourly Supabase monitor remains pending until scripts/CI tooling lands in this repo; coordinating with data on raw log export (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_sample.ndjson`).

## 2025-10-08 — Product Coordination
- Request from product: please confirm ETA for restoring the Supabase decision sync monitoring assets (`scripts/ci/supabase-sync-alerts.js`, `.github/workflows/supabase-sync-monitor.yml`) so Linear item OCC-212 can move out of blocked. Looking for latest status + owner to capture in backlog by 2025-10-09 EOD.
- Also need confirmation on where the next Supabase log export will land (path + timestamp) once generated; product will attach evidence link in `feedback/product.md` and the M1/M2 backlog when available.

## Governance Acknowledgment
- Reviewed docs/directions/README.md and docs/directions/reliability.md; acknowledge manager-only ownership, canon references, and Supabase secret policy.

## 2025-10-12 — Shopify Embed Token Escalation
- Localization Playwright runs against `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1` redirect/403 to `admin.shopify.com` without a Shopify embed token; see console traces captured during the latest attempt (`feedback/localization.md:100-108`).
- Requesting reliability to partner with deployment on supplying a sanctioned embed token or approved host shim so localization can resume automated modal screenshots.
- Need storage/rotation guidance for the token (vault path + GitHub secret plan) before wiring the value into Playwright workflows; holding automation until that direction lands.
- Dependency tracked in `docs/directions/localization.md:34`; will confirm back once reliability provides the sanctioned path so localization can capture evidence for enablement.

## Notes
- Reliability feedback log initialized; CI gate for Supabase secrets now active.
