## 2025-10-11T02:00:13Z â€” Localization audit kickoff (status: blocked, awaiting direction)
- Commands executed:
  - Attempt 1 (rg-based): bash -lc '<rg audit script creating artifacts dirs, sanctioned FR excludes, scans and drift checks>'
  - Attempt 2 (grep -P fallback): bash -lc '<grep-based audit script using scan_list helper and per-surface scans>'
- Output/evidence:
  - Artifacts summary: artifacts/localization/audits/2025-10-11T020013Z/status.md
  - Notes: ripgrep is not installed; both attempts encountered path expansion issues that caused writes to root (e.g., /scan_*.txt), leading to permission errors. No source files were modified; no secrets touched.
- Proposed next steps (awaiting manager approval):
  1) Install ripgrep and re-run a simplified, step-by-step scan (no eval, no functions) targeting UI/Chatwoot/Runbooks/Marketing, or
  2) Proceed with grep -P only in smaller, per-surface chunks, or
  3) Narrow initial scope to UI + Chatwoot scans, then expand.
- Blockers:
  - Shopify Admin screenshot workflow pending embed token delivery; prep folders will be created after scans succeed.
- Request:
  - Please advise which option to proceed with, and whether to install ripgrep on this workstation.
