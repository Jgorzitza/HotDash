# Support Daily Status — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- Reviewed Operator Control Center project structure and north star (docs/strategy/initial_delivery_plan.md)
- Assessed current Chatwoot template library: 3 templates active (app/services/chatwoot/templates.ts)
- Identified gaps: no operator escalation playbooks, no runbooks directory, no Q&A documentation yet
- Dashboard not yet in production; cannot capture operator feedback or monitor integration health

## Chatwoot Template Status
- **Current templates:** 3 active in app/services/chatwoot/templates.ts:7-23
  - ack_delay: "Acknowledge delay"
  - ship_update: "Shipping updated"
  - refund_offer: "Refund offer"
- **Last AI/engineer review:** Not yet conducted (dashboard not live)
- **Template update log:** None (scope `ops` Memory entries pending first review cycle)

## Operator Escalation Playbooks
- **Status:** Not created
- **Blocker:** CX tile workflows not yet live; need operational dashboard to map tile actions to SOPs
- **Next action:** Once CX escalations tile deployed, create docs/runbooks/ structure with escalation ladder per conversation type

## Q&A / Confusing States
- **Status:** No operator training sessions conducted yet
- **Blocker:** Dashboard in development; no live operator workflows to observe
- **Next action:** Schedule Q&A capture sessions post-launch; file tickets for confusing states in Linear with screenshots

## Incidents & Resolution Time
_No incidents logged — dashboard not yet in production_

## Integration Health Monitoring
- **Shopify:** Service layer implemented (app/services/shopify/), not yet monitoring error thresholds
- **Chatwoot:** Service layer implemented (app/services/chatwoot/), not yet monitoring SLA breaches
- **GA:** Running in mock mode (DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=true), MCP host credentials pending
- **Next action:** Post-release, monitor integration errors and alert reliability if thresholds breach per support direction

## Evidence Links
- Chatwoot templates: app/services/chatwoot/templates.ts:7-23
- Support direction: docs/directions/support.md
- North star plan: docs/strategy/initial_delivery_plan.md

## Blockers / Risks
- Dashboard not yet deployed; cannot execute core support responsibilities (playbook creation, operator training, template reviews)
- No runbooks directory structure exists yet
- No Memory (scope `ops`) entries for template review tracking
- Awaiting operator feedback sessions to document confusing states and file improvement tickets

## Next Actions (Per Support Direction)
1. Wait for CX escalations tile deployment
2. Create docs/runbooks/ directory and map each CX tile action to internal SOP + escalation ladder
3. Schedule daily AI/engineer template review once dashboard live; log updates in Memory (scope `ops`)
4. Conduct operator training sessions; capture Q&A and file tickets for confusing dashboard states
5. Monitor post-release integrations; alert reliability if error rates breach thresholds or SLAs slip

## Follow-up Tasks
_Will populate as operator feedback sessions begin and incidents occur_

## Governance Acknowledgment — 2025-10-06
- Reviewed docs/directions/README.md and docs/directions/support.md; acknowledge manager-only ownership and Supabase secret policy.
