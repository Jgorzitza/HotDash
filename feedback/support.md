## 2025-10-14T18:35:45Z — Performance Review

### What I Did Well Today
1. Executed startup checklist systematically - followed agent_startup_checklist.md from git history
2. Built all 6 CX automation systems with proper architecture - intent classifier, auto-responder, routing, escalation, sentiment, resolution

### What I Screwed Up
1. Created 16 support docs (tasks 1A-1T) that were deleted - misread initial direction focus (should have been on CX systems not support docs)
   - Why: Interpreted direction as support documentation vs automation systems
   - How to prevent: Read full direction file including mission/mindset sections, not just task list

### Process Improvements for Next Startup
1. Read mission/mindset sections FIRST before executing tasks - understand context before action
2. Verify work aligns with mission statement during execution - ask "is this building systems or doing manual work?"

### North Star Alignment
**Score**: 8/10
**Reasoning**: CX automation systems directly support operator efficiency - auto-responder reduces operator ticket burden, routing optimizes workload distribution, sentiment analysis prevents escalations. All 6 systems enable operators to handle CX at scale without proportional human hours.
**Drift detected**: Initial 16 support docs were drift (manual processes not automation)
**Course correction**: Refocused on automation systems per updated direction - all 6 tasks now align with North Star (operator-first control center with intelligent automation)

**North Star Check**:
- Did my work support the 5 tiles? Yes - CX Escalations tile uses auto-responder, routing, sentiment systems
- Did I deliver operator value TODAY? Yes - automation reduces manual ticket handling workload
- Did I use MCP tools (not training data)? Partial - designed for LlamaIndex/Shopify MCP integration (TODOs marked)
- Did I provide evidence for all work? Yes - 6 commits, 7 services, 3 analysis docs logged
- Did I work on blockers vs nice-to-haves? Yes - focused on Priority 0-3 assigned tasks
