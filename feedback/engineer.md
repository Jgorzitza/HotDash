## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Reviewed sprint focus (Supabase sync fix, Postgres staging enablement, modal polish, telemetry wiring) per `docs/directions/engineer.md`.
- Blocked: currently handling integrations workload; engineering execution paused until dedicated owner and pending dependencies (Supabase schema, Lighthouse target) are resolved.

## 2025-10-08 — Direction Acknowledgment
- Reread docs/directions/engineer.md sprint focus (Supabase sync stability, Postgres staging enablement, modal polish, dashboard telemetry) and ready to execute.
- Dependency: Supabase data/reliability need to apply `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` so the parity script can compare rows without `PGRST205` failures.
- Status: Feature flag module restored locally; unit tests now pass when `npm run test:unit` targets affected specs.
- Status: Lighthouse runner now consumes `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` fallback; waiting on staging secret wiring before evidence capture.

## 2025-10-08 — Progress Update
- Supabase parity script now surfaces missing `facts` table with actionable hint and references new `supabase/sql/analytics_facts_table.sql` bootstrap SQL.
- Added Supabase facts bootstrap SQL and documented it in `docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md` so staging Postgres mirrors can be prepared before parity checks.
- Restored feature flag configuration (`app/config/featureFlags.ts`) with dual-prefix support plus unit coverage, unblocking `npm run test:unit`.
- Updated Lighthouse runner to fall back to `STAGING_SMOKE_TEST_URL` and seeded `.env.example` so evidence commands run locally once the smoke URL is known.

## 2025-10-08 — Sprint Focus Activation
- Partnered with reliability/data to catalogue Supabase failure signatures (timeouts vs 4xx) as prep for instrumentation patch per `docs/directions/engineer.md:26`.
- Assembled Postgres staging enablement checklist (env overrides, Prisma commands, smoke script) ready to execute once deployment delivers credentials per `docs/directions/engineer.md:27`.
- Compiled accessibility polish to-dos for CX Escalations + Sales Pulse modals (ARIA labels, focus traps, status icons) and queued design questions to satisfy `docs/directions/engineer.md:28`.
- Drafted telemetry wiring plan for dashboard refresh events (loader/action/analytics service) aligning with `docs/directions/engineer.md:29`; pending analytics artifact references to finalize.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Reviewed Supabase retry/backoff implementation with reliability to scope additional integration coverage; waiting on production parity script to validate fix against real data.
- Began drafting Postgres staging smoke checklist (migrate forward/back, seed, smoke tests) to support QA once credentials arrive; currently blocked by database access from deployment.
- Sketched accessibility polish tasks for CX Escalations/Sales Pulse modals (ARIA labels, focus traps) and queued work behind outstanding design annotation updates.
- Captured active triage checklist in `artifacts/logs/supabase_retry_plan_2025-10-09.md` so instrumentation/logging tasks can move as soon as Supabase credentials land.

## 2025-10-08 Sprint Execution
- Added detailed logging branch for Supabase decision sync failures (captures `status`, `duration_ms`, `retry_count`) pending secret delivery so we can replay incidents per sprint focus.
- Partnered with deployment on mapping Prisma Postgres overrides; staged command sequence (`npm run db:migrate:postgres`, `npm run db:rollback:postgres`) for QA once credentials are shared.
- Started aligning telemetry events for dashboard refresh (loader/action) with analytics service to unblock instrumentation as soon as Supabase blockers are cleared.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Focus Kickoff
- Supabase decision sync triage: reviewed existing retry implementation and outlined additional instrumentation (structured error logging + parity counters); blocked on reliability delivering raw logs and staging credentials to reproduce the 25% failure.
- Postgres staging enablement: synced with deployment to confirm pending env overrides and smoke script; awaiting DB credentials before running forward/back migration validation.
- Modal polish: listed outstanding accessibility items (status icons, focus-visible tweaks) and queued work once designer assets/Figma tokens arrive.
- Dashboard refresh telemetry: mapped loader/action touchpoints for event logging; need Supabase decision log persistence before wiring metrics end-to-end.

# Engineer Daily Status — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- **Database**: Created and applied Prisma migration `20251005160022_add_dashboard_facts_and_decisions`
- **Testing**: Implemented auth bypass for test/mock mode; configured Playwright; all unit tests passing (6/6)
- **UI Components**: Refactored dashboard with design token integration following Polaris alignment
  - Created `app/styles/tokens.css` with full design system tokens
  - Built modular tile component library (`app/components/tiles/`)
  - Extracted 5 tile components: Sales Pulse, Fulfillment Health, Inventory Heatmap, CX Escalations, SEO Content
  - Refactored `app._index.tsx` to use new components with testId attributes for E2E testing
- **Build**: Verified successful build with CSS tokens (app-BnOxWyYj.css: 5.92 kB)

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Prisma migration created and applied for DashboardFact and DecisionLog tables
2. ✅ Test bypass implemented for Shopify authentication (app.tsx:8-15, supports NODE_ENV=test and ?mock=1)
3. ✅ Playwright configuration updated for test environment (playwright.config.ts:21-32)
4. ✅ Design tokens CSS created with Polaris alignment (app/styles/tokens.css)
5. ✅ Tile component library created (app/components/tiles/)
   - TileCard (base wrapper with status, metadata display)
   - SalesPulseTile, FulfillmentHealthTile, InventoryHeatmapTile, CXEscalationsTile, SEOContentTile
6. ✅ Dashboard route refactored to use modular components (app/routes/app._index.tsx)
7. ✅ All unit tests passing (6/6 test files)
8. ✅ Build verified with CSS token integration

## Evidence Links

### Database Migrations
- Migration: `prisma/migrations/20251005160022_add_dashboard_facts_and_decisions/migration.sql`
- Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma:34-62`

### UI Components & Design Tokens
- Design tokens: `app/styles/tokens.css` (6.68 kB compiled)
- Tile components: `app/components/tiles/`
  - `TileCard.tsx` (base wrapper)
  - `SalesPulseTile.tsx`
  - `FulfillmentHealthTile.tsx`
  - `InventoryHeatmapTile.tsx`
  - `CXEscalationsTile.tsx`
  - `SEOContentTile.tsx`
  - `index.ts` (barrel export)
- Dashboard: `app/routes/app._index.tsx` (refactored with token integration)

### Testing Infrastructure
- Unit tests: **6/6 passing** (tests/unit/)
- Build output: `build/client/assets/app-BnOxWyYj.css` (5.92 kB)
- Playwright config: `playwright.config.ts`
- Auth bypass: `app/routes/app.tsx:8-15`

## Blockers / Risks
- Playwright E2E tests may need additional configuration for full green status (server startup timing)
- Feature flag system not yet implemented per engineer directions (`agent/engineer/<tile>`)
- No dedicated test database configuration (currently using dev.sqlite for all environments)

## Next Actions (Per Manager's Direction)
Based on manager feedback (2025-10-05), next priority is:
- Implement wireframe components using design tokens from docs/design/tokens/
- Follow Polaris design system alignment per docs/design/wireframes/dashboard_wireframes.md
- Ensure accessibility criteria met (WCAG 2.2 AA) per docs/design/accessibility_criteria.md
- Implement localization using copy deck (docs/design/copy_deck.md)

## Compliance with Engineer Directions
- ✅ Maintain caching discipline: Services use cache.ts with TTL respect
- ✅ Prisma migrations paired with client regen: Migration applied with `prisma generate`
- ✅ Unit tests with Vitest: 6/6 passing
- ⚠️ Feature flags: Not yet implemented (future work)
- ⚠️ Evidence mandate (Vitest + Playwright + Lighthouse): Vitest ✓, Playwright config ✓, Lighthouse pending
- ✅ ServiceErrors logged with scope + code: Implemented in services/types.ts
- ✅ Mock mode discipline: All services support mock mode via DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK env var

## Technical Debt / Follow-up Items
1. Verify Lighthouse target URL is defined and capture current performance evidence
2. Consider adding integration tests for Prisma operations once Postgres staging backfills stabilize
3. Evaluate CI coverage for Playwright smoke to ensure staging pipeline stays green post-refresh wiring

## 2025-10-08 — Postgres Staging Configuration
- Added Postgres-specific Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.postgres.prisma`) and npm helpers (`db:*:postgres`) so QA can run forward/back migration drills against managed Postgres.
- Published `.env.staging.example` template carrying Postgres + evidence env hooks for deployment/reliability coordination.
- Authored runbook `docs/runbooks/prisma_staging_postgres.md` documenting setup, migrate/reset steps, and evidence capture for QA/deployment.
- Updated `docs/deployment/env_matrix.md` to reference the new runbook beside the `DATABASE_URL` guidance.

## Governance Acknowledgment — 2025-10-06
- Reviewed docs/directions/README.md and docs/directions/engineer.md; acknowledge manager-only ownership and Supabase secret policy.
