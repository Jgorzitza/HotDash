# Engineer Daily Status — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- **Database**: Created and applied Prisma migration `20251005160022_add_dashboard_facts_and_decisions`
- **Testing**: Implemented auth bypass for test/mock mode; configured Playwright; all unit tests passing (6/6)
- **UI Components**: Refactored dashboard with design token integration following Polaris alignment
  - Created `app/styles/tokens.css` with full design system tokens
  - Built modular tile component library (`app/components/tiles/`)
  - Extracted 5 tile components: Sales Pulse, Fulfillment Health, Inventory Heatmap, CX Escalations, SEO Content
  - Refactored `app._index.tsx` to use new components with testId attributes for E2E testing
- **Build**: Verified successful build with CSS tokens (app-BnOxWyYj.css: 5.92 kB)

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Prisma migration created and applied for DashboardFact and DecisionLog tables
2. ✅ Test bypass implemented for Shopify authentication (app.tsx:8-15, supports NODE_ENV=test and ?mock=1)
3. ✅ Playwright configuration updated for test environment (playwright.config.ts:21-32)
4. ✅ Design tokens CSS created with Polaris alignment (app/styles/tokens.css)
5. ✅ Tile component library created (app/components/tiles/)
   - TileCard (base wrapper with status, metadata display)
   - SalesPulseTile, FulfillmentHealthTile, InventoryHeatmapTile, CXEscalationsTile, SEOContentTile
6. ✅ Dashboard route refactored to use modular components (app/routes/app._index.tsx)
7. ✅ All unit tests passing (6/6 test files)
8. ✅ Build verified with CSS token integration

## Evidence Links

### Database Migrations
- Migration: `prisma/migrations/20251005160022_add_dashboard_facts_and_decisions/migration.sql`
- Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma:34-62`

### UI Components & Design Tokens
- Design tokens: `app/styles/tokens.css` (6.68 kB compiled)
- Tile components: `app/components/tiles/`
  - `TileCard.tsx` (base wrapper)
  - `SalesPulseTile.tsx`
  - `FulfillmentHealthTile.tsx`
  - `InventoryHeatmapTile.tsx`
  - `CXEscalationsTile.tsx`
  - `SEOContentTile.tsx`
  - `index.ts` (barrel export)
- Dashboard: `app/routes/app._index.tsx` (refactored with token integration)

### Testing Infrastructure
- Unit tests: **6/6 passing** (tests/unit/)
- Build output: `build/client/assets/app-BnOxWyYj.css` (5.92 kB)
- Playwright config: `playwright.config.ts`
- Auth bypass: `app/routes/app.tsx:8-15`

## Blockers / Risks
- Playwright E2E tests may need additional configuration for full green status (server startup timing)
- Feature flag system not yet implemented per engineer directions (`agent/engineer/<tile>`)
- No dedicated test database configuration (currently using dev.sqlite for all environments)

## Next Actions (Per Manager's Direction)
Based on manager feedback (2025-10-05), next priority is:
- Implement wireframe components using design tokens from docs/design/tokens/
- Follow Polaris design system alignment per docs/design/wireframes/dashboard_wireframes.md
- Ensure accessibility criteria met (WCAG 2.2 AA) per docs/design/accessibility_criteria.md
- Implement localization using copy deck (docs/design/copy_deck.md)

## Compliance with Engineer Directions
- ✅ Maintain caching discipline: Services use cache.ts with TTL respect
- ✅ Prisma migrations paired with client regen: Migration applied with `prisma generate`
- ✅ Unit tests with Vitest: 6/6 passing
- ⚠️ Feature flags: Not yet implemented (future work)
- ⚠️ Evidence mandate (Vitest + Playwright + Lighthouse): Vitest ✓, Playwright config ✓, Lighthouse pending
- ✅ ServiceErrors logged with scope + code: Implemented in services/types.ts
- ✅ Mock mode discipline: All services support mock mode via DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK env var

## Technical Debt / Follow-up Items
1. Implement feature flag system for tiles per `agent/engineer/<tile>` pattern
2. Create dedicated test database configuration
3. Verify Playwright E2E tests run successfully end-to-end (currently configured but not validated in CI)
4. Set up Lighthouse target URL and validate performance metrics
5. Consider adding integration tests for Prisma operations
