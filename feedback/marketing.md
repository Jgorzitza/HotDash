# Marketing Daily Status — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- Reviewed Operator Control Center north-star plan (docs/strategy/initial_delivery_plan.md) and v1 tile scope.
- Reviewed designer's copy deck (docs/design/copy_deck.md) — comprehensive EN/FR localization complete for all tiles, CTAs, toasts, modals.
- Identified marketing workstream: launch comms, release notes, tooltips, social sentiment API contracts, campaign calendar, brand tone guidance.

## Blockers / Risks
- No brand style guide located yet; need to establish tone guidance baseline or reference existing Shopify brand standards.
- Social sentiment integration (phase 2) has no vendor selection; cannot finalize API contracts without product decision on X/Meta vs. Shopify social app integration.
- Release notes template needs product approval on milestone structure (per-tile vs. per-sprint).

## Evidence Links
- Direction: docs/directions/marketing.md
- Strategy: docs/strategy/initial_delivery_plan.md
- Product plan: docs/directions/product_operating_plan.md
- Copy deck: docs/design/copy_deck.md

## Next Actions (Pending Manager Direction)
1. Draft launch communications script (email, in-app banner, blog post) aligned with Mock → Staging → Production release cadence.
2. Create release notes template covering CX Escalations, Sales Pulse, Inventory Heatmap, SEO & Content Watch milestones.
3. Draft in-admin tooltip copy for tile approval actions (coordinate with designer on placement).
4. Document placeholder API contracts for social sentiment integration (X API, Meta Graph API, Shopify social apps) for product review.
5. Build weekly campaign calendar with KPI targets (activation rate, SLA resolution time, anomaly response metrics from docs/directions/product.md).
6. Supply brand tone guidance doc with evidence links (pending style guide location or creation).
7. Coordinate with designer on localization glossary + translation key format.

## Governance Acknowledgment — 2025-10-06
- Reviewed docs/directions/README.md and docs/directions/marketing.md; acknowledge manager-only ownership and Supabase secret policy.
