# Marketing Daily Status — 2025-10-09

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Revisited sprint focus (launch comms packet, operator FAQ/training script, launch timeline playbook) per `docs/directions/marketing.md`.
- Blocked: currently executing integrations work; require marketing owner to continue delivering artifacts and managing approvals.

## 2025-10-08 — Sprint Focus Activation
- Revalidated launch comms packet requirements with product to ensure evidence bundle lines up with `docs/directions/marketing.md:26`; pending launch window to finalize distribution dates.
- Partnered with enablement/support on FAQ + training script alignment, capturing edits needed before the 2025-10-16 dry run per `docs/directions/marketing.md:27`.
- Started translating launch timeline playbook milestones into calendar holds contingent on product’s go-live window as called out in `docs/directions/marketing.md:28`.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Reviewed launch comms packet approvals and drafted outreach plan to secure product sign-off; pending final go-live window from product before sending.
- Coordinated with enablement/support on the operator FAQ/training script alignment; awaiting their feedback to incorporate into the dry run materials.
- Began converting launch timeline playbook milestones into date-specific schedule, but blocked until product provides production deployment window.
- Updated staging preview checklist to pull in designer tooltip annotations once delivered (`docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md`), keeping playbook aligned with new design assets.

## Summary
- Added approval tracker + character-count validations to the launch comms packet (`docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`) so product can sign off on English copy without hunting references.
- Authored full support training script for the 2025-10-16 dry run (`docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md`) and synced talking points with the FAQ.
- Published the launch timeline playbook (`docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md`) covering phase checklists, KPIs, and dependency matrix for once the launch date lands.

## Deliverables Completed Today
1. Launch comms packet approval tracker + copy guardrails (EN-first) — `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md`
2. Support training script for dry run — `docs/marketing/support_training_script_2025-10-16.md`
3. Launch timeline playbook with KPI tracking — `docs/marketing/launch_timeline_playbook.md`

## Blockers / Risks
- **Launch window confirmation (Product):** Still waiting on production date to pin campaign calendar and move timeline playbook from relative T- dates to actuals.
- **Tooltip placement annotations (Design):** Due 2025-10-08 @ 12:00 ET; follow-up if not delivered so engineering wiring stays on track.
- **Localization scope:** Paused per manager direction; resume only if product reopens multi-language launch requirement.

## Requests / Questions for Manager
- Please nudge product for the go-live window so we can translate the playbook into calendar dates and lock ESP scheduling.
- Confirm whether marketing should circulate the support training invites or coordinate through enablement once scheduling is final.

## Next Session Priorities (2025-10-10)
1. Incorporate product/design/localization feedback into comms + tooltip assets the moment it lands.
2. Prep evidence bundle (screenshots, ESP checks) so approvals can attach quickly once launch date is final.
3. Draft launch-day metrics dashboard outline with data team pending Supabase credential delivery.

# Marketing Daily Status — 2025-10-08

## Direction Acknowledgment
- Reviewed `docs/directions/marketing.md` (2025-10-08 sprint refresh) and confirm focus on launch comms packet, operator FAQ + training script, and launch timeline playbook.

## Summary
- Prepped evidence bundle for the launch communications packet so we can attach proof once product signs off on the English-only strings.
- Coordinated with enablement to align the operator FAQ/training script updates with the 2025-10-16 dry run agenda; awaiting their final notes.
- Sketched launch timeline playbook structure (milestones, campaign triggers, KPI checkpoints) pending production window confirmation.

### Deliverables In Flight
1. Launch communications packet proof bundle (ties to `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md` and approval packet).
2. Operator FAQ + training script alignment with enablement feedback.
3. Launch timeline playbook draft synced to campaign calendar + deployment milestones.

## Blockers / Risks
- **Launch window confirmation:** Product still needs to lock the production go-live window; blocks finalizing campaign calendar, comms timing, and the new playbook milestones.
- **Tooltip placement annotations:** Awaiting designer overlays (due 2025-10-08 @ 12:00 ET) to complete engineering handoff in `docs/marketing/tooltip_placement_request_2025-10-07.md`.
- **Localization QA:** FR review for "Centre OCC" abbreviation pending localization sign-off (due 2025-10-09 @ 18:00 ET).

## Requests / Questions for Manager
- Please confirm when product expects to lock the production launch window so marketing can finalize the timeline playbook and campaign calendar.
- Should marketing coordinate directly with enablement on the 2025-10-16 training dry run logistics or loop you in on scheduling?

## Next Session Priorities (2025-10-09)
1. Integrate product/design/localization feedback into launch comms + tooltip documentation once received.
2. Finalize the operator FAQ/training script package and attach evidence to this log.
3. Flesh out the launch timeline playbook with campaign triggers and KPI checkpoints as soon as the launch window is confirmed.

   - Version numbering scheme (v[MAJOR].[MILESTONE].[PATCH])
   - Evidence requirements (Vitest, Playwright, Lighthouse, screenshots)
   - Full example release (v1.M2.0) with all 5 tiles
   - Tile-specific snippets for incremental releases
   - Distribution plan (in-app changelog, email, blog, partner portal)

3. **Brand Tone & Talking Points Deck** (docs/marketing/brand_tone_deck.md)
   - Tone guidelines ("professional but approachable")
   - Voice attributes (trustworthy, operator-first, action-oriented, concise)
   - Talking points by audience (operators, CX leads, marketing owners, technical)
   - Message hierarchy + competitive differentiation
   - Localization guidance (EN/FR)
   - Support training script with Q&A
   - 50-word and 100-word boilerplate copy (EN/FR)

4. **Social Sentiment Integration Plan** (docs/marketing/social_sentiment_integration_plan.md)
   - 3 vendor options: X API, Meta Graph API, Hootsuite (Shopify App)
   - Complete API contracts (TypeScript interfaces)
   - Rate limits, pricing, vendor approval requirements
   - Recommended approach: Hootsuite POC → Hybrid (X + Meta) production
   - Data contract expectations (dashboard facts schema)
   - Phase 2 timeline: 9 weeks (M5-M9)

## Blockers / Risks

### Resolved
- ~~No brand style guide~~ → Created brand tone deck (docs/marketing/brand_tone_deck.md)
- ~~Social sentiment vendor not selected~~ → Documented 3 options with recommendation (Hootsuite POC)
- ~~Release notes structure unclear~~ → Created template with per-tile milestone approach

### Current Blockers
- **Product approval pending:** Release notes template + brand tone deck need product review for tone/messaging alignment
- **Designer coordination pending:** In-admin tooltip placement (copy ready, awaiting wireframe annotations)
- **Support training timing:** Brand tone deck ready for support team; awaiting training session schedule

### New Risks Identified
1. **Social sentiment vendor approval timeline:** X API Elevated Access (2-4 weeks) or Meta Business Verification (4-6 weeks) could delay Phase 2
   - Mitigation: Recommend Hootsuite (1-2 weeks) for faster POC
   - Owner: Product (vendor selection decision)

2. **French translation quality:** Brand tone deck translations are marketing-provided, not professional service
   - Mitigation: Flagged for translation service review (aligns with designer's recommendation)
   - Owner: Product + Translation Service

3. **Launch comms timing:** Production launch date not confirmed; comms packet ready but cannot schedule distribution
   - Mitigation: Comms templates ready for rapid deployment once launch date set
   - Owner: Product + Manager
