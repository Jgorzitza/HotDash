# Pilot — Feedback — 2025-10-18

## Plan
- Execute agent_startup_checklist (North Star, Operating Model, Rules, direction review)
- Locate lane molecules in reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json or document blocker
- Create artifacts directory structure + tasks.todo files per startup instructions
- Capture MCP evidence before code changes; log heartbeat for long commands if required
- Proceed with first available molecule once direction + lanes identified

## Log
- 00:00 UTC — Startup checklist kickoff (M-001)
- 00:03 UTC — Reviewed NORTH_STAR, OPERATING_MODEL, RULES per runbook
- 00:07 UTC — Attempted to locate docs/directions/pilot.md (missing)
- 00:09 UTC — Searched for lane molecules file reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json (missing)
- 00:12 UTC — Created artifacts directory + tasks.todo.{md,json}; logged MCP evidence startup.jsonl

## Risks / Blockers
- Direction file docs/directions/pilot.md missing; lane file reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json not found.
