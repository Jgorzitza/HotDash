# Pilot — Feedback — 2025-10-19

## Plan
- Execute guardrail checks per docs/directions/pilot.md (fmt, lint, test:ci, scan)
- Capture MCP heartbeat evidence for each long command
- Update tasks.todo trackers and feedback with status/evidence

## Log
- 05:23 UTC — Ran `npm run fmt` via heartbeat (foreground-20251019T052353Z.ndjson)
- 05:24 UTC — `npm run lint` failed due to ESLint env/pattern gaps; adjusted `.eslintrc.cjs` and `.gitignore`
- 05:27 UTC — Resolved lint export conflicts in `tests/utils/render.tsx`; lint now passes (foreground-20251019T053352Z.ndjson)
- 05:34 UTC — `npm run test:ci` halted: Playwright reports “No tests found”; config/test suite mismatch remains

## Risks / Blockers
- `npm run test:ci` currently blocked by Playwright configuration—requires follow-up before Definition of Done can be met.

### Shutdown — 01:17 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: _n/a (direction-only slice)_ — PR: _none_ — Branch: _none_
- DoD completion: 50% (fmt & lint complete; test:ci failing; scan not started)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Logged heartbeat evidence for fmt and lint runs
  - Updated ESLint config and test utilities to reduce lint errors
  - Investigated Playwright “No tests found” failure during `npm run test:ci`

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: `artifacts/pilot/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T052353Z.ndjson`, `artifacts/pilot/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T053352Z.ndjson`, `artifacts/pilot/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T053410Z.ndjson`
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: heartbeat wrapper (`scripts/policy/with-heartbeat.sh`), repository config edits (no remote adapters invoked today)

**Blockers**

- Playwright suite cannot discover tests under current configuration → **owner**: me → **ETA**: next working session pending config fix
- Secrets scan pending due to above blocker chain → **owner**: me → **ETA**: after test:ci succeeds

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Resolve Playwright project configuration so `npx playwright test` discovers `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`
2. Re-run `npm run test:ci`, then `npm run scan`, updating artifacts and feedback with results

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 2
- Evidence quality: 4
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 4
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 3

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Captured heartbeat evidence for each required command attempt.
  2. Brought ESLint into compliance without suppressing legitimate project rules.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Validate Playwright project discovery locally before running full CI.
  2. Stage secrets scan earlier once tests are green.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Allowing config gaps (like Playwright testDir) to linger without re-verifying suite discovery immediately after edits.

### Manager Note — Areas for Improvement (10)

1. I underestimated the impact of existing lint debt and lost time refactoring configuration mid-run.
2. I did not confirm Playwright test discovery after editing `playwright.config.ts`, leading to repeated `No tests found` failures.
3. I delayed escalating the Playwright blocker until the shutdown note instead of flagging it immediately when first encountered.
4. I allowed heartbeats to pile up without synthesizing next actions until late in the session, slowing feedback-loop velocity.
5. I modified global configs (`.eslintrc.cjs`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`) without pre-validating downstream effects on other agents’ lanes.
6. I failed to stage `npm run scan`, so Definition of Done progress sits blocked behind unresolved tests.
7. I spent cycles adjusting ESLint cache behavior instead of diagnosing the cached export errors more directly.
8. I did not set up a minimal Playwright reproduction to isolate why `tests/e2e` isn’t detected, leaving the root cause unconfirmed.
9. I let the tasks.todo summary lag while troubleshooting, which could confuse anyone picking up the lane mid-stream.
10. I focused on tooling fixes but didn’t propose a rollback path in case the lint configuration changes introduce regressions for other teams.

## 2025-10-19T08:00:00Z — Pilot: Session Restart - Continuing from Previous Blockers

**Working On**: Resolving Playwright test discovery blocker, then completing DoD (test:ci, scan)

**Progress**: Session restarted, executing agent startup checklist

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Read startup checklist (docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md)
- ✅ Read NORTH_STAR.md, OPERATING_MODEL.md, RULES.md (alignment confirmed)
- ✅ Read direction file (docs/directions/pilot.md)
- ✅ Previous session status reviewed: fmt ✅, lint ✅, test:ci ❌ (Playwright), scan ⏹️
- ✅ MCP tools verified available (Supabase MCP responded, requires auth as expected)

**Blockers**: 
- Inherited: Playwright "No tests found" from previous session
- Action: Will diagnose and resolve test discovery issue

**Next**: 
1. Investigate Playwright config and test file locations
2. Fix test discovery
3. Run test:ci with heartbeat
4. Run scan with heartbeat
5. Complete DoD and update feedback

## 2025-10-19T08:15:00Z — Pilot: Guardrail Validation Progress Update

**Working On**: Repository baseline validation per docs/directions/pilot.md (guardrail checks: fmt, lint, test:ci, scan)

**Progress**: 50% complete (2 of 4 tasks passing)

**Evidence**:
- ✅ fmt: Passed cleanly (artifacts/pilot/2025-10-19/heartbeat/run-2025-10-19T02_14_44-06_00.ndjson)
- ✅ lint: Passed with 1 warning (unused var in api.analytics.traffic.ts) (artifacts/pilot/2025-10-19/heartbeat/run-2025-10-19T02_14_57-06_00.ndjson)
- ⚠️ test:ci: Unit tests 187/187 passed, E2E tests 0/9 failed (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED - server not running) (artifacts/pilot/2025-10-19/heartbeat/run-2025-10-19T02_15_12-06_00.out.log)
- ⏹️ scan: Not started (blocked by incomplete test:ci)

**Blockers**: 
- Playwright E2E tests require dev server running on http://127.0.0.1:4173
- Tests configured for mock mode but webServer not starting in CI environment
- Per package.json, test:e2e wraps `playwright test || true` (allows failures)
- test:ci chain requires all sub-commands to complete

**Next**: 
1. Review Playwright config webServer settings (lines 70-83 in playwright.config.ts)
2. Determine if E2E tests should run with or without server in CI
3. Complete test:ci execution
4. Run scan with heartbeat
5. Update DoD checklist in feedback

## 2025-10-19T09:00:00Z — Pilot: Task 1 Status - Playwright Config Issue

**Working On**: Task 1 - Fix Playwright test discovery (CRITICAL)

**Progress**: Partial - Tests discovered, config fixed, but runtime blocker

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Playwright test discovery working (9 tests in 2 files: dashboard.spec.ts, modals.spec.ts)  
- ✅ Fixed playwright.config.ts webServer to always start (was undefined in mock mode)
- ✅ Fixed build error: Removed duplicate export in app/services/ads/metrics.service.ts (lines 218-224)
- ❌ Runtime blocker: react-router import error in server build
  - Error: "The requested module 'react-router' does not provide an export named 'json'"
  - Location: build/server/assets/server-build-DFB47Sc2.js:7
  - Issue: Version mismatch or build configuration issue with React Router 7

**Blockers**: 
- E2E tests blocked by server startup failure
- react-router dependency incompatibility in production build
- Time: Already spent 40+ minutes on this task (exceeds 40min allocation)

**Decision**: 
Per direction time constraints (6 hours total, 40min for Task 1), escalating E2E blocker and proceeding with completable tasks:
- Unit/Integration tests already passing (187/187)
- Can validate via manual testing (Task 4-10)
- Will document E2E blocker in final pilot report (Task 12)

**Next**: Move to Task 2 (full test suite validation with unit/integration), then Task 3 (security scan)
