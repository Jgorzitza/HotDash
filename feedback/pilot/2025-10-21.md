### Recommendations

**For Engineer**:
1. **P1**: Implement Inventory modal trigger button on Inventory Heatmap tile
2. **P2**: Fix Escape key handler for modal close functionality
3. **P2**: Investigate and resolve React errors (#418, #425, #423) before production
4. **P2**: Implement focus trap for modals (Tab should cycle within modal)
5. **P2**: Set initial focus to first interactive element when modal opens

**For Pilot (Next Session)**:
1. Re-test Inventory modal once Engineer implements trigger
2. Perform comprehensive keyboard navigation testing (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape)
3. Test focus trap functionality in detail
4. Perform screen reader testing with NVDA or VoiceOver
5. Verify WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with axe DevTools
6. Perform performance benchmarks (modal load time, memory leaks)

**For Manager**:
- **Phase 2 Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL PASS** - 2/3 modals working, 1 modal missing
- **Blocker**: Inventory modal needs implementation before Phase 2 can be marked complete
- **Timeline Impact**: 1-2 hours estimated for Engineer to add Inventory modal trigger
- **Next**: Coordinate with Engineer to implement Inventory modal, then re-test

- Phases 9-12 implementation: 16-20 hours estimated (4-5 hours per phase)
- PILOT-012 smoke test: 2 hours (execute when Phase 9 complete)
- PILOT-013 smoke test: 2 hours (execute when Phase 10 complete)
- PILOT-014 smoke test: 2 hours (execute when Phase 11 complete)
- PILOT-015 smoke test: 1 hour (execute when Phase 12 complete)
- PILOT-016 browser/mobile: 5 hours (can prep now, execute after Phase 12)
- **Total Pilot work**: 12 hours (7h smoke tests + 5h browser/mobile)

**If Engineer phases delayed**:
- Continue PILOT-016 preparation
- Create detailed test scenarios for PILOT-012 through PILOT-015
- Document expected behaviors for each phase
- Build test automation framework for future use

### Communication to Manager

### Key Research Findings

**From Playwright Docs**:
- Multi-browser projects configuration
- Device emulation with viewport and user agent
- Browser channel specification for branded testing
- Test isolation with browser contexts

**From web.dev**:
- Viewport meta tag: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
- Touch target sizing: 30x30px minimum for coarse pointers
- Input type optimization: `type="email"`, `type="tel"`, etc.
- Responsive breakpoints based on content, not devices

### Chrome DevTools MCP Test Workflow Documented

**Testing Pattern** (to be executed):
1. Navigate to staging environment
2. Take baseline snapshot (desktop)
3. Execute test scenarios
4. Resize to mobile viewports
5. Re-execute scenarios
6. Capture screenshots for evidence
7. Document findings in feedback
