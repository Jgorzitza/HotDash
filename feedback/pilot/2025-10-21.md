#### ‚ùå FAILED / BLOCKED Tests (2/7)

1. **Inventory Modal - NOT FOUND** (EM-008, EM-009, EM-010 blocked)
   - ‚ùå No button or trigger found for Inventory modal
   - ‚ùå Inventory Heatmap tile has no "View details" or similar action button
   - ‚ùå Cannot test 14-day velocity, reorder workflow, vendor selection

---

### Console Errors (Still Present)

**React Errors Detected**: 25 errors in console
- Error #418: 24 occurrences (Minified React error - likely Suspense/lazy loading related)
- Error #425: 1 occurrence (Minified React error - likely hydration mismatch)
- Error #423: 1 occurrence (Minified React error - likely context provider issue)

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Errors do NOT block functionality** (modals work despite errors)

**Recommendation**: Engineer should investigate and fix React errors for production readiness, but not a P0 blocker for Phase 2 completion

---

### Recommendations

**For Engineer**:
1. **P1**: Implement Inventory modal trigger button on Inventory Heatmap tile
2. **P2**: Fix Escape key handler for modal close functionality
3. **P2**: Investigate and resolve React errors (#418, #425, #423) before production
4. **P2**: Implement focus trap for modals (Tab should cycle within modal)
5. **P2**: Set initial focus to first interactive element when modal opens

**For Pilot (Next Session)**:
1. Re-test Inventory modal once Engineer implements trigger
2. Perform comprehensive keyboard navigation testing (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape)
3. Test focus trap functionality in detail
4. Perform screen reader testing with NVDA or VoiceOver
5. Verify WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with axe DevTools
6. Perform performance benchmarks (modal load time, memory leaks)

**For Manager**:
- **Phase 2 Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL PASS** - 2/3 modals working, 1 modal missing
- **Blocker**: Inventory modal needs implementation before Phase 2 can be marked complete
- **Timeline Impact**: 1-2 hours estimated for Engineer to add Inventory modal trigger
- **Next**: Coordinate with Engineer to implement Inventory modal, then re-test
