## 2025-10-20T14:37:00Z ‚Äî Pilot: üö® SAME P0 BLOCKER RETURNED - App Misconfigured AGAIN

**Working On**: Attempted to verify AppProvider fix, discovered config reverted

**Progress**: 0% - BLOCKED by same config issue from Oct 19

**Evidence**:

1. **Navigated to App**:
   - URL: https://admin.shopify.com/store/hotroddash/apps/hotdash
   - Expected: Dashboard with 6 tiles
   - Actual: DNS error in iframe ‚ùå

2. **Config Regression Discovered**:
   - App URL NOW: `https://rhythm-closing-struck-signed.trycloudflare.com/`
   - App URL YESTERDAY: `https://physiology-spoken-magnificent-much.trycloudflare.com/`
   - App URL SHOULD BE: `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev`
   - **ERROR**: "server IP address could not be found" (tunnel not running)
   - **STATUS**: Dev Console shows "App preview ON" (dev mode active AGAIN)

3. **Root Cause**:
   - SAME issue as Oct 19 - app pointing to dead Cloudflare tunnel
   - Configuration was fixed yesterday, but has REVERTED
   - Likely: Local dev session ran `shopify app dev` which reset config
   - Production URL not persisting in Shopify Partners Dashboard

4. **Impact**:
   - Cannot test AppProvider fix (can't access dashboard)
   - Cannot test PIL-002 (Dashboard Tile Interactions)
   - Cannot test PIL-003 (Approvals HITL Flow)
   - Cannot test Option A features
   - **ALL Oct 20 tasks blocked**

**Screenshot**: `artifacts/pilot/oct20-01-config-issue-returned.png`

**Blocker Summary**:
- **Issue**: Shopify app URL reverted to Cloudflare tunnel (AGAIN)
- **Severity**: **P0 - BLOCKS ALL TESTING**
- **Owner**: Manager (Shopify Partners Dashboard access)
- **Fix**: Update App URL to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev` AND prevent dev mode from overwriting it
- **Root Cause**: `shopify app dev` command likely overwrites production config
- **Recommendation**: Need permanent fix in Shopify Partners Dashboard

**Escalation to Manager**:

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Go to Shopify Partners Dashboard
2. Update App URL to: `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev`
3. **IMPORTANT**: Ensure this is set as PRODUCTION URL (not dev preview)
4. May need to disable "App preview" mode permanently
5. Consider: Separate dev app vs production app to prevent this

**This is the SECOND time** this config has reverted. Need permanent solution.

**Blockers**:
- All Oct 20 Pilot tasks blocked until config fixed
- Cannot verify Engineer's AppProvider fix
- Cannot test dashboard or drawers
- Cannot test Option A features

**Time Spent**: 5 minutes (3 testing + 2 investigation)

**Next**: Awaiting Manager's permanent fix to Shopify app configuration
