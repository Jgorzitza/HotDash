# Reliability → Engineering Coordination — 2025-10-09

## Supabase Decision Sync Monitor — Action Items
- Flagged missing assets (`scripts/ci/supabase-sync-alerts.js`, `.github/workflows/supabase-sync-monitor.yml`) required to reinstate hourly decision sync monitoring. Provided context on prior incident (25% failure rate) and retry/backoff mitigation already in place.
- Shared requirements for the script: read Supabase decision sync logs (scope `ops`), emit structured metrics (`successCount`, `failureCount`, latency percentiles), and exit non-zero when thresholds exceeded. Requested alignment with existing logging format (`supabase.decisionSync`).
- Requested engineering to port the parity script from their workspace or supply patch by 2025-10-10 15:00 UTC so reliability can integrate with CI.
- Asked for confirmation that structured logging patch covers both timeout and 4xx/5xx error codes, and that the script exposes artifact output under `artifacts/logs/` for downstream analysis.
- Offered to validate the workflow once script lands and wire GitHub Actions schedule (`cron: '0 * * * *'`) per prior design.

## Awaiting
- Engineering ETA for delivering script + logging patch.
- Confirmation of artifact path and environment variables required (e.g., `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`).

## Next Follow-up
- If no response by 2025-10-09 19:00 UTC, escalate to manager with updated blocker note in `feedback/reliability.md` and mirror in `feedback/manager.md` per direction governance.
