## Optimization Phase â€” 01:00-01:10 (10 min)

### Initial Plan Created
- Created dispatch plan for all 5 PRs (#103-107)
- 8 agents Ã— 5 PRs = 40 potential invocations
- Estimated timeline: 120+ minutes

### Manager Directive
User requested: "Ensure the plan is efficient and fits our goals"

### Optimized Plan
- **PRs Analyzed**: Reduced from 5 to 3 P1 PRs (#104, #106, #107)
- **Agents Used**: Reduced from 8 to 5-6 agents (smart selection)
- **Timeline**: 35-65 minutes (vs. 120+ min) â†’ **71% faster**
- **Focus**: Infrastructure & governance PRs (block these first to prevent cascading issues)

**Evidence**:
- reports/manager/2025-10-20/qa_dispatch_plan.md (initial)
- reports/manager/2025-10-20/qa_dispatch_plan_optimized.md (final)

## Shutdown â€” 2025-10-20T01:50:00Z (local time)

### Status

- **Task**: QA Dispatch execution for 3 P1 PRs
- **Issue**: N/A (meta-agent role, not tracked in issue system)
- **PR**: N/A (QA DISPATCHER doesn't create PRs, only analyzes them)
- **Branch**: main (no branch required for dispatcher role)
- **DoD completion**: 100% âœ…

### What changed since last entry

1. **Optimized dispatch strategy**: Reduced scope from 5 PRs to 3 P1 PRs, 8 agents to 5-6 agents
2. **Executed 5 specialized sub-agents** in 2 parallel phases (Phase 1: 3 agents, Phase 2: 2 agents)
3. **Generated 15 comprehensive reports** (~52KB documentation):
   - 3 consolidated PR reports (for Manager decision-making)
   - 1 executive summary (dispatch results overview)
   - 5 diff reviews
   - 1 docs validation report
   - 1 security scan report
   - 4 MCP evidence audit files
   - 4 pact contract files

### Evidence

**Tests/logs/screens**:
- All reports in reports/manager/2025-10-20/ and reports/qa/
- Pact files in contracts/pacts/
- Total: 15 files, ~52KB documentation

**Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used**:
- Task tool: 5 invocations (launched 5 specialized sub-agents)
- Bash: 10 invocations (gh pr view, git status, ps, ls, find)
- Read: 7 invocations (read QA reports, dispatch plans, shutdown checklist)
- Write: 8 invocations (consolidated reports, dispatch summary, feedback file)
- Glob: 3 invocations (found shutdown checklist, report files)

### Blockers

**NONE** - Execution complete, awaiting Manager action on 3 PRs:
1. PR #104: Manager must fix 5 blockers (~10 min)
2. PR #106: Manager should approve and merge
3. PR #107: Manager should approve and merge

### Next-start plan (first 1â€“2 actions)

**If QA DISPATCHER role continues**:
1. Await Manager feedback on 3 consolidated reports
2. Re-scan PR #104 after Manager fixes blockers
3. Analyze remaining PRs #103, #105 if requested

**If returning to QA agent role**:
1. Read updated docs/directions/qa.md for new assignments
2. Execute assigned molecules from issue tracker

### Self-grade (1â€“5)

- **Progress vs DoD**: 5/5 â€” All objectives met, 3 PRs analyzed, 2 approved, 1 blocked with fix instructions
- **Evidence quality**: 5/5 â€” 52KB documentation, machine-readable pact files, actionable recommendations with time estimates
- **Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths)**: 5/5 â€” All reports in reports/qa/** and contracts/pacts/**, no governance violations, found 5 blockers in PR #104
- **Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets)**: 5/5 â€” Used Task tool to launch sub-agents, 0 secrets found in scans
- **Communication (feedback clarity & cadence)**: 5/5 â€” Clear consolidated reports with BLOCKER/WARNING/PASS signals, draft PR comments included

### Retrospective

**2â€“3 things I did well today**:
1. **Optimized dispatch strategy**: Recognized that 3 P1 infrastructure PRs needed priority over 5 total PRs, reduced timeline by 71%
2. **Found critical blocker early**: Identified 3 forbidden .md files in PR #104 that would have violated governance policy if merged
3. **Evidence-based recommendations**: Every blocker/warning has file path, line number, agent source, and fix instructions with time estimates

**1â€“2 things to do differently tomorrow**:
1. **Consider automated MCP evidence validation**: Create CI check for Context7/Shopify MCP conversation IDs to prevent process compliance gaps
2. **Add pre-commit hook for forbidden .md patterns**: Automate detection of URGENT_*, STATUS_*, etc. patterns before they reach PR stage

**One thing I will stop entirely**:
- **Assuming all PRs have equal priority**: Will always analyze PR scope and impact before creating dispatch plans (infrastructure > features)
