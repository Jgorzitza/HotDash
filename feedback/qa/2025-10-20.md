# QA Feedback — 2025-10-20

**Agent:** QA DISPATCHER
**Role:** QA Dispatch Orchestrator (Meta-Agent)
**Objective:** Orchestrate 8 specialized QA sub-agents to analyze 5 open PRs, generate consolidated reports with BLOCKERS/WARNINGS/PASS signals
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

## Session Start — 2025-10-20T01:00:00Z

### Role Assignment
- Transitioned from QA agent to QA DISPATCHER (meta-agent role)
- Objective: Dispatch 8 specialized sub-agents to analyze PRs #103-107
- Constraints: No Git/GitHub CLI privileges, write only to reports/qa/** and contracts/pacts/**
- Focus: Proof > prose, evidence-based recommendations

### Sub-Agents Available
1. qa-pr-diff-reviewer
2. qa-e2e-shopify-admin
3. api-contract-validator
4. mcp-tools-qa
5. qa-a11y-polaris
6. qa-sec-scanner
7. docs-qa-validator
8. qa-data-telemetry

---

## Optimization Phase — 01:00-01:10 (10 min)

### Initial Plan Created
- Created dispatch plan for all 5 PRs (#103-107)
- 8 agents × 5 PRs = 40 potential invocations
- Estimated timeline: 120+ minutes

### Manager Directive
User requested: "Ensure the plan is efficient and fits our goals"

### Optimized Plan
- **PRs Analyzed**: Reduced from 5 to 3 P1 PRs (#104, #106, #107)
- **Agents Used**: Reduced from 8 to 5-6 agents (smart selection)
- **Timeline**: 35-65 minutes (vs. 120+ min) → **71% faster**
- **Focus**: Infrastructure & governance PRs (block these first to prevent cascading issues)

**Evidence**:
- reports/manager/2025-10-20/qa_dispatch_plan.md (initial)
- reports/manager/2025-10-20/qa_dispatch_plan_optimized.md (final)

## Shutdown — 2025-10-20T01:50:00Z (local time)

### Status

- **Task**: QA Dispatch execution for 3 P1 PRs
- **Issue**: N/A (meta-agent role, not tracked in issue system)
- **PR**: N/A (QA DISPATCHER doesn't create PRs, only analyzes them)
- **Branch**: main (no branch required for dispatcher role)
- **DoD completion**: 100% ✅

### What changed since last entry

1. **Optimized dispatch strategy**: Reduced scope from 5 PRs to 3 P1 PRs, 8 agents to 5-6 agents
2. **Executed 5 specialized sub-agents** in 2 parallel phases (Phase 1: 3 agents, Phase 2: 2 agents)
3. **Generated 15 comprehensive reports** (~52KB documentation):
   - 3 consolidated PR reports (for Manager decision-making)
   - 1 executive summary (dispatch results overview)
   - 5 diff reviews
   - 1 docs validation report
   - 1 security scan report
   - 4 MCP evidence audit files
   - 4 pact contract files

### Evidence

**Tests/logs/screens**:
- All reports in reports/manager/2025-10-20/ and reports/qa/
- Pact files in contracts/pacts/
- Total: 15 files, ~52KB documentation

**Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used**:
- Task tool: 5 invocations (launched 5 specialized sub-agents)
- Bash: 10 invocations (gh pr view, git status, ps, ls, find)
- Read: 7 invocations (read QA reports, dispatch plans, shutdown checklist)
- Write: 8 invocations (consolidated reports, dispatch summary, feedback file)
- Glob: 3 invocations (found shutdown checklist, report files)

### Blockers

**NONE** - Execution complete, awaiting Manager action on 3 PRs:
1. PR #104: Manager must fix 5 blockers (~10 min)
2. PR #106: Manager should approve and merge
3. PR #107: Manager should approve and merge

### Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)

**If QA DISPATCHER role continues**:
1. Await Manager feedback on 3 consolidated reports
2. Re-scan PR #104 after Manager fixes blockers
3. Analyze remaining PRs #103, #105 if requested

**If returning to QA agent role**:
1. Read updated docs/directions/qa.md for new assignments
2. Execute assigned molecules from issue tracker

### Self-grade (1–5)

- **Progress vs DoD**: 5/5 — All objectives met, 3 PRs analyzed, 2 approved, 1 blocked with fix instructions
- **Evidence quality**: 5/5 — 52KB documentation, machine-readable pact files, actionable recommendations with time estimates
- **Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths)**: 5/5 — All reports in reports/qa/** and contracts/pacts/**, no governance violations, found 5 blockers in PR #104
- **Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets)**: 5/5 — Used Task tool to launch sub-agents, 0 secrets found in scans
- **Communication (feedback clarity & cadence)**: 5/5 — Clear consolidated reports with BLOCKER/WARNING/PASS signals, draft PR comments included

### Retrospective

**2–3 things I did well today**:
1. **Optimized dispatch strategy**: Recognized that 3 P1 infrastructure PRs needed priority over 5 total PRs, reduced timeline by 71%
2. **Found critical blocker early**: Identified 3 forbidden .md files in PR #104 that would have violated governance policy if merged
3. **Evidence-based recommendations**: Every blocker/warning has file path, line number, agent source, and fix instructions with time estimates

**1–2 things to do differently tomorrow**:
1. **Consider automated MCP evidence validation**: Create CI check for Context7/Shopify MCP conversation IDs to prevent process compliance gaps
2. **Add pre-commit hook for forbidden .md patterns**: Automate detection of URGENT_*, STATUS_*, etc. patterns before they reach PR stage

**One thing I will stop entirely**:
- **Assuming all PRs have equal priority**: Will always analyze PR scope and impact before creating dispatch plans (infrastructure > features)

---

## WORK COMPLETE ✅

**Deliverables**:
- 3 consolidated PR reports (520 + 380 + 595 lines = 1,495 lines)
- 1 executive summary (361 lines)
- 11 agent-specific reports (~50KB)
- 4 pact contract files (34.6KB)

**Results**:

### Current State Assessment

**Phase 1 Status** (from PROJECT_PLAN.md):
- ✅ COMPLETE and DEPLOYED (Fly v70, 2025-10-20T18:03Z)
- ✅ Tasks: ENG-001 to ENG-004 complete
- ✅ Tests: 241/273 passing (88.3%)
- ⏸️ Designer validation: PENDING (needs retest after i18n fix)

**Next Phase** (Phase 2 - Enhanced Modals + OpenAI SDK):
- Timeline: 8 hours
- Tasks: ENG-005 (CX grading sliders), ENG-006 (Sales Pulse actions), ENG-007 (Inventory reorder)
- Dependencies: Data migrations must be applied FIRST (5 tables: user_preferences, notifications, approvals_history, sales_pulse_actions, inventory_actions)
- QA Role: Code review AFTER Engineer completes, BEFORE Designer validates

**Blockers Identified**:
- ⏸️ Data migrations (5 pending) must be applied before Phase 2 can start
- ⏸️ Designer retest of Phase 1 (verification after i18n fix)

---

### Task #1: Understand Current Test Status

**Objective**: Assess test suite health before Phase 2 verification

**Commands to run**:
```bash
npm run test:ci
npm run test:unit
npm run lint
npm run scan
```

**Expected outputs**:
- Test count and pass rate
- Any regressions from Phase 1
- Linting status
- Security scan status

**Evidence will be logged below** once executed.

## Task #2: Database Migration Verification — 2025-10-20T13:50:00Z

**Objective**: Verify 5 Data migrations are correctly structured with RLS policies

**Migration Files Verified**:
1. ✅ `20251020210000_user_preferences.sql` (91 lines)
2. ✅ `20251020211500_notifications.sql` (117 lines) - Creates 2 tables
3. ✅ `20251020213000_approvals_history.sql` (47 lines)

5. ✅ `20251020215000_inventory_actions.sql` (53 lines)

**Schema Verification**:

**Table 1: user_preferences**
- Columns: id, user_id, tile_order (TEXT[]), visible_tiles (TEXT[]), default_view, theme, created_at, updated_at, project
- Indexes: user_id, project
- Triggers: updated_at auto-update ✅
- RLS: ✅ ENABLED with 4 policies (service_role_all, read_by_project, insert_by_project, update_by_project)
- Multi-tenant: ✅ project column with UNIQUE(user_id, project)

**Table 2: notifications**

- RLS: ✅ ENABLED with 4 policies
- Multi-tenant: ✅ project column with UNIQUE(user_id, project)

**Table 4: approvals_history**
- Columns: id, created_at, conversation_id, tool_name, action (CHECK), operator_name, details (JSONB), project
- Indexes: created_at DESC, action, project
- RLS: ✅ ENABLED with 2 policies (service_role_all, read_by_project)
- Multi-tenant: ✅ project column
- Note: Read-only for authenticated users (no INSERT/UPDATE policies) - correct for audit trail

**Table 5: sales_pulse_actions**
- Columns: id, created_at, action_type (CHECK), revenue_variance, selected_action, notes, operator_name, metadata (JSONB), project
- Indexes: created_at DESC, action_type, project

## Task #3: Test Failure Analysis — 2025-10-20T13:55:00Z

**Objective**: Analyze 6 failing tests in tiles.spec.tsx (feedback only, no fix)

**Test File**: tests/unit/components/dashboard/tiles.spec.tsx (92 lines)

**Root Cause**:
```typescript
Line 3: import { renderWithPolaris as render } from "../../../helpers/test-utils";
```

**Problem**: `tests/helpers/test-utils.ts` does NOT export `renderWithPolaris` function

**Evidence**: Read test-utils.ts (143 lines)
- Exports: createMockResponse, mockShopifyResponse, createMockServiceError, waitForAsync, withEnv, mockConsole, createMockRequest, assertThrows, createMockDateRange
- Missing: renderWithPolaris ❌

**Affected Tests** (all same root cause):
1. AOVTile > should render value and trend
2. AOVTile > should show loading state
3. ReturnsTile > should render count and pending
4. StockRiskTile > should render SKU count
5. SEOTile > should render alert count
6. CXTile > should render escalation count

**Error**: `TypeError: renderWithPolaris is not a function`

**Impact**: Medium
- Components may be working correctly in production ✅
- Tests cannot verify component rendering ❌
- Accessibility testing blocked (needs render function) ❌

**Fix Recommendation** (for Engineer):
Create `renderWithPolaris` helper in test-utils.ts:
```typescript
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { AppProvider } from "@shopify/polaris";
import enTranslations from "@shopify/polaris/locales/en.json";

export function renderWithPolaris(ui: React.ReactElement) {
  return render(
    <AppProvider i18n={enTranslations}>
      {ui}
    </AppProvider>
  );
}
```

**Estimated Fix Time**: 10 minutes
**Priority**: P2 (not blocking Phase 2, but should fix before Phase 11 accessibility audit)

---

## Task #4: Phase 2 Code Review Preparation — 2025-10-20T14:00:00Z

**Objective**: Prepare Context7 MCP documentation requirements for Phase 2 code review

**Phase 2 Tasks to Review**:
- ENG-005: CX Escalation Modal grading sliders (React, TypeScript, Polaris)
- ENG-006: Sales Pulse Modal variance actions (React Router 7 actions, Prisma INSERT)
- ENG-007: Inventory Modal reorder workflow (React Router 7 actions, Prisma INSERT)

### Context7 MCP Docs Required

**1. React Router 7** (`/react-router/react-router`)
- **Topics to pull**:
  - Form actions and FormData handling
  - Action functions (POST requests)
  - Loader/action error handling
  - Response.json() patterns
  - useFetcher hook (for modal submissions)
- **Why**: All 3 tasks submit forms from modals to server actions
- **Verification**: Ensure no @remix-run imports (React Router 7 ONLY)

**2. Polaris** (`/shopify/polaris`)
- **Topics to pull**:
  - Form components (TextField, Select, RangeSlider)
  - Modal accessibility (focus trap, keyboard nav, ARIA)
  - Button states (loading, disabled)
  - FormLayout patterns
  - Color contrast requirements (4.5:1 text, 3:1 interactive)
- **Why**: ENG-005 adds grading sliders, all tasks enhance modals
- **Verification**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance

**3. TypeScript** (`/microsoft/TypeScript`)
- **Topics to pull**:
  - Type inference for form data
  - Strict null checks
  - Type guards for validation
  - Generic constraints
  - Discriminated unions for action types
- **Why**: All tasks need type-safe form handling and action payloads
- **Verification**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types

**4. Prisma** (`/prisma/docs`)
- **Topics to pull**:
  - INSERT operations with @@schema attribute
  - Multi-schema support (all tables in "public" schema)
  - Transaction handling
  - Error handling (unique constraint violations)
  - Type generation and Prisma Client
- **Why**: ENG-006 and ENG-007 insert into sales_pulse_actions and inventory_actions tables
- **Verification**: All models have @@schema("public"), no raw SQL

### Code Review Checklist (Per Task)

**Context7 Verification** (MANDATORY):
- [ ] React Router 7 patterns verified (no @remix-run imports)
- [ ] Polaris components used correctly (with i18n)
- [ ] TypeScript types correct (no any, strict mode)
- [ ] Prisma operations safe (@@schema present, RLS respected)

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] No console.log in production code
- [ ] Error boundaries present
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] No hardcoded strings (use microcopy from Content agent)
- [ ] No secrets in code

**Testing**:
- [ ] Unit tests added (+2 minimum per component)
- [ ] Test coverage ≥80% for new code
- [ ] All tests passing (npm run test:ci)
- [ ] Playwright tests for modal interactions (if applicable)

**Accessibility** (WCAG 2.2 AA):
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (Tab through all controls)
- [ ] Focus indicators (4.5:1 contrast)
- [ ] ARIA labels on interactive elements
- [ ] Semantic HTML (form, button, label)
- [ ] Color contrast verified (text 4.5:1, interactive 3:1)
- [ ] Focus trap in modals (Escape key closes)

**Security**:
- [ ] npm run scan passing (no secrets)
- [ ] No SQL injection vectors (Prisma ORM only)
- [ ] Input validation present (server-side)
- [ ] XSS protection (React default + validation)

**Database Safety**:
- [ ] Prisma operations use @@schema("public")
- [ ] No migrations in deployment files (fly.toml, package.json)
- [ ] RLS policies respected (project-scoped queries)
- [ ] Transactions used for multi-table operations

**Evidence Required**:
- [ ] Context7 MCP conversation IDs logged in feedback
- [ ] MCP tool usage logged (4+ calls minimum)
- [ ] Issues documented with severity + owner

### MCP Evidence Logging Format

```md
## HH:MM - Context7: React Router 7
- Topic: Form actions and useFetcher
- Key Learning: useFetcher.Form automatically serializes FormData and calls action
- Verified: ENG-005 uses useFetcher correctly ✅
- Found Issue: Missing error handling in action ❌
- Recommendation: Add try/catch with user-friendly error message

## HH:MM - Context7: Prisma
- Topic: INSERT with @@schema attribute
- Key Learning: All models must have @@schema("public") when datasource has schemas array
- Verified: sales_pulse_actions INSERT includes project for RLS ✅
- Recommendation: PASS
```

**Minimum Evidence**: 4+ MCP tool calls per code review session

**QA Readiness**: ✅ **PHASE 2 CODE REVIEW PREP COMPLETE**
