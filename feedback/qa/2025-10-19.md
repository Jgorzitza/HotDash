# QA — Feedback — 2025-10-19

## Status
- Blocker P0 (build failure) cleared. Local build succeeded.
- Evidence: artifacts/engineer/20251019/{typecheck.log,build.log}

## Next Actions (Resume)
1. Run minimal smoke: start built server + GET `/` → expect 200.
2. Run route check for `/approvals` → expect 200 or expected redirect.
3. Execute a11y subset (`npm run test:a11y`) and attach report.
4. Update this log with outcomes and open issues for any failures.

## Notes
- rails/health returning 404 on Chatwoot is expected for current deploy; `/api` and authed probe return 200.
