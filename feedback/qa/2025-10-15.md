## Today's Plan

### Priority 1: Environment Setup ✅
1. ✅ Create feedback directory and file
2. ✅ Verify MCP tools operational
3. ✅ Create branch `agent/qa/quality-gates`
4. ✅ Check for existing GitHub Issues needing acceptance criteria
   - **Finding:** No open Issues (per manager feedback)
   - **Finding:** No active PRs (per manager feedback)
   - **Action:** Will create acceptance criteria template and test plan template first

### Priority 2: Define Acceptance Criteria
1. ⏳ Review NORTH_STAR scope (Dashboard, Inventory, CX, Growth)
2. ⏳ Identify all foundation Issues (or create if missing)
3. ⏳ Add clear, testable acceptance criteria to each Issue
4. ⏳ Ensure criteria align with DoD requirements

### Priority 3: Create Test Plan Template ✅
1. ✅ Design template structure
2. ✅ Include test types (unit, integration, E2E)
3. ✅ Add evidence requirements section
4. ✅ Add DoD checklist
5. ✅ Create at `docs/specs/test_plan_template.md`

**Deliverable:** Created comprehensive test plan template with:
- Test types: Unit (Vitest), Integration (Vitest), E2E (Playwright), Manual
- Evidence requirements: Test results, functional, performance, security
- Error handling and edge cases section
- Rollback plan section
- Complete DoD checklist (global + feature-specific)
- Sign-off section for QA and Manager
- Post-deployment validation section

**Bonus:** Also created `docs/specs/acceptance_criteria_guide.md` with:
- INVEST criteria framework
- Examples by feature type (Dashboard, API, Integration, HITL)
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Review checklist
- Integration with global DoD

### Priority 4: PR Reviews
1. ⏳ Review engineer's dashboard PR (if exists)
2. ⏳ Review integrations PR (if exists)
3. ⏳ Review data agent PR (if exists)
4. ⏳ Validate evidence (screenshots, tests, rollback plans)
5. ⏳ Ensure 100% DoD compliance

## Blockers
- None currently

## Next Steps
1. Verify MCP tools operational
2. Create QA branch
3. Check GitHub for existing Issues
4. Begin acceptance criteria definition

## Commands Executed
```bash
# Check current date
date +%Y-%m-%d
# Output: 2025-10-15

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
# Output: agent/engineer/dashboard-foundation

# Check git remote

# Create feedback directory
mkdir -p feedback/qa

# Verify MCP tools
./mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh
# Output: ✅ All 6 MCP servers operational

# Create QA branch
git checkout -b agent/qa/quality-gates
# Output: Switched to a new branch 'agent/qa/quality-gates'
```
