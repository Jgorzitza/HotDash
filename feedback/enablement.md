**Agent SDK Launch: GO! 🚀**

## 2025-10-11T20:30:00Z - MANAGER CORRECTION: North Star Realignment ⚠️

**Issue Identified**: Deviation from North Star principles
**Corrective Action**: Refocus on minimal pilot training (Tasks 2-3 only)
**Status**: ✅ Corrected, minimal launch training created

### 🚨 Deviation Analysis

**What I Did Wrong:**
- ❌ Created comprehensive 250K+ word training ecosystem (Tasks 4-42)
- ❌ Built elaborate systems (LMS, knowledge graphs, gamification) before product launch
- ❌ Focused on future-state comprehensive training instead of minimal viable for pilot
- ❌ Violated "Evidence or no merge" principle (elaborate planning vs shipping)

**North Star Says:**
> "Deliver a trustworthy, operator-first control center embedded inside Shopify Admin that unifies CX, sales, SEO/content, social, and inventory into actionable tiles with agent-assisted approvals. **Evidence or no merge.**"

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Ship working product with MINIMAL support documentation
- ✅ Launch pilot with just-enough training to start
- ✅ Learn from real usage, then iterate
- ✅ Evidence-based decisions (pilot results inform future training)

**What I Should Have Done:**
- ✅ Created ONLY Tasks 2-3 (Quick Start + 30-min session)
- ✅ Kept it simple and practical for pilot
- ✅ **Flagged to manager**: "Tasks 4-42 seem beyond launch needs - should we focus on minimal pilot training first and expand based on pilot feedback?"

---

### ✅ Corrective Tasks Executed

**Task 2: Quick Start Guide (CORRECTED)** ✅
- **File**: `docs/enablement/LAUNCH_PILOT_QUICK_START.md`
- **Length**: 1 page, 5-minute read
- **Content**: Minimal pilot training
  - What approval queue is (30 seconds)
  - How to approve/reject (30 seconds)
  - Always escalate list (threats, high-value, technical, unsure)
  - Quick decision checklist
  - Getting help (contacts)
  - Pilot expectations (5-15 approvals/day)
- **Format**: Simple, printable, practical
- **Evidence**: `/home/justin/HotDash/hot-dash/docs/enablement/LAUNCH_PILOT_QUICK_START.md`

**Task 3: 30-Min Pilot Training Session (CORRECTED)** ✅
- **File**: `docs/enablement/LAUNCH_PILOT_30MIN_TRAINING.md`
- **Duration**: 30 minutes (not 90+ minutes)
- **Content**: Minimal session outline
  - Part 1: What & Why (5 min)
  - Part 2: Live Demo (10 min) - 3 quick demos (approve, reject, escalate)
  - Part 3: Top 5 FAQ (10 min) - Essential questions only
  - Part 4: Hands-on (5 min) - Quick interface tour
- **Approach**: Simple, practical, pilot-focused
- **Follow-up**: Daily check-ins during pilot Week 1
- **Evidence**: `/home/justin/HotDash/hot-dash/docs/enablement/LAUNCH_PILOT_30MIN_TRAINING.md`

- 250,000+ words
- 30 complex systems
- 86 video modules planned
- 60 microlearning modules
- Complete training empire

**After Correction (Tasks 2-3 Only):**
- 2 simple documents
- ~5,000 words total
- Practical pilot training
- Just enough to start
- Learn from pilot, then expand

**Approach:**
- Before: Build everything upfront (waterfall)
- After: Minimal launch, learn, iterate (agile) ✅

---

### 📝 Lessons Learned

**What I'll Do Differently:**

1. **Flag Scope Creep Early:**
   - When tasks expand from 6 → 42, ask: "Is this aligned with launch needs?"
   - Check: Does this serve immediate pilot or future-state?
   - Manager feedback: "This seems beyond launch scope - should I focus on minimal viable first?"

2. **Reference North Star:**
   - "Evidence or no merge" = ship working product, minimal docs
   - Don't build elaborate systems before validating with real usage
   - Pilot data informs future training needs

3. **Minimal Viable Training:**
   - What's the LEAST training needed to start?
   - What can wait until after we have pilot evidence?
   - Simple > comprehensive for launch

4. **Question Expanding Requirements:**
   - Original: 6 tasks for pilot
   - Expanded: 42 tasks (7× scope)
   - Should have asked: "Are all 42 needed for launch or is this post-launch roadmap?"

---

### 📁 Status of Created Materials

**Launch-Critical (ACTIVE):**
- ✅ Task 1: 4 Loom modules (already complete)
- ✅ Task 2: LAUNCH_PILOT_QUICK_START.md (corrected, minimal)
- ✅ Task 3: LAUNCH_PILOT_30MIN_TRAINING.md (corrected, minimal)

**Post-Launch Expansion (PAUSED per manager direction):**
- ⏸️ Tasks 4-42: All comprehensive materials created
- ⏸️ Status: Available for post-launch use if pilot shows need
- ⏸️ Decision: Resume after pilot completion based on evidence

**Disposition:**
- Keep created materials (may be useful post-launch)
- Don't distribute now (minimal pilot training only)
- Use pilot feedback to determine what's actually needed
- Iterate based on evidence, not assumptions

---

### ✅ Corrective Action Complete

**Correct Tasks (2-3) Now Created:**
- Quick Start Guide: 1 page, 5 min read, practical ✅
- 30-Min Training: Simple session, just enough to start ✅

**Paused Until After Launch:**
- Comprehensive training materials (Tasks 4-42)
- Wait for pilot evidence
- Expand based on real operator needs

**Evidence-Based Next Steps:**
- Launch pilot with minimal training
- Collect operator feedback
- Identify real training gaps
- Build what's actually needed (not what we assume)

**Alignment:** ✅ Now aligned with North Star ("Evidence or no merge")

---

### 🎯 Future Manager Accountability

**I commit to flagging drift when I notice:**
- ❗ Scope expanding beyond immediate deliverable
- ❗ Building for future-state vs current needs
- ❗ Elaborate planning instead of shipping
- ❗ Assumptions instead of evidence-based decisions

**How I'll Flag:**
"⚠️ NORTH STAR CHECK: [Task/approach] seems to deviate from [North Star principle]. Should I [corrective action] instead? Requesting manager guidance with evidence: [specific concern]."

**Manager can then:**
- Confirm course correction needed
- OR explain why expansion aligns with strategy
- OR provide updated direction

**Result:** Stay aligned with North Star through continuous checking

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-11T20:30:00Z
**Agent**: Enablement
**Action**: Manager correction executed
**Status**: ✅ **CORRECTED - NOW ALIGNED WITH NORTH STAR**

**Launch Training Ready:**
- Task 1: ✅ Videos complete
- Task 2: ✅ Quick Start Guide (minimal)
- Task 3: ✅ 30-Min Training Session (minimal)

**Pilot Launch:** ✅ GO with minimal training (evidence-based approach)

**Comprehensive Materials:** ⏸️ PAUSED until pilot evidence shows what's needed

---

**Lesson Learned:** Evidence or no merge. Ship minimal, learn from reality, iterate based on data. ✅
