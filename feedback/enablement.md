# Enablement Agent — Daily Status Log

_Pending staffing update. Acknowledge `docs/directions/enablement.md` upon assignment._

## Distribution Hold — 2025-10-10 07:45 UTC

**Progress**:
- Added facilitator talking point blocks to the CX Escalations and Sales Pulse job aids so trainers can rehearse verbally while staging remains degraded.
- Cross-checked dry-run packet assets; confirmed job aids and AI scenario packets are ready for distribution once `?mock=0` returns 200.
- Repointed all AI kit references to the refreshed Supabase export (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_export_2025-10-10T07-29-39Z.ndjson`) so facilitators rehearse with the same dataset the hourly monitor now tracks.
- Received support ping (2025-10-10 07:10 UTC) and tentatively accepted a 2025-10-10 15:30 UTC roster sync hold; will confirm facilitator + scribe coverage ahead of that slot.
- Built a staging evidence table inside `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md` so curl logs, synthetic JSON, NDJSON export, and overlay swaps can be filled the minute QA reports green.
- Expanded facilitator prep matrix + acknowledgement statuses in `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md` so packet can ship immediately once QA posts green smoke.

**Blockers**:
- `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` still returns HTTP 410, so packet distribution and acknowledgement logging stay paused per manager direction.
- Waiting on designer overlay checklists to replace the interim text callouts in `docs/enablement/job_aids/annotations/2025-10-16_dry_run_callouts.md`.

**Next Actions**:
- Coordinate with design to lock the overlay checklist handoff time and capture any asset gaps (see `feedback/designer.md`).
- Re-run staging smoke the moment reliability signals a fix; package the dry-run bundle and log stakeholder acknowledgements immediately after we see 200.
- Draft invite copy so distribution can go out within minutes once staging stabilises.

## Dry Run Prep — 2025-10-10 07:55 UTC

**Progress**:
- Reran staging smoke (`curl -I https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0`) — still returning HTTP/2 410; latest capture lives at `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/curl_mock0_2025-10-10T07-57-48Z.log` so we can swap in the green run immediately.
- Added draft overlay checklist to `docs/enablement/job_aids/annotations/2025-10-16_dry_run_callouts.md` so design can validate callout numbers/alt text ahead of screenshot swap.
- Appended distribution announcement copy, acknowledgement log template, and smoke evidence checklist to the dry-run packet (`docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`).
- Coordinated with marketing/support to ensure the staging access rollout comms row, announcement template, and evidence table align before QA greenlight; referenced in both `docs/marketing/launch_comms_packet.md` and this packet.

**Blockers**:
- Live staging (`?mock=0`) remains HTTP 410; cannot distribute materials until we have a 200 response and synthetic evidence.
- Awaiting design confirmation on overlay checklist draft and final annotated assets.

**Next Actions**:
- Once reliability reports 200 OK, rerun smoke, archive evidence under `artifacts/integrations/shopify/<date>/`, and populate acknowledgement log.
- Schedule facilitator huddle (target T-24h) to rehearse new talking points and Supabase evidence capture; draft agenda pending staging green light.
- After design review, swap interim text callouts with final overlays and update job aids accordingly.

## Enablement Activation — 2025-10-10 02:51 UTC
- Confirmed latest direction canon (`docs/directions/enablement.md`, `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`, `docs/git_protocol.md`, `docs/directions/README.md`) and reviewed operator packet materials before resuming ownership.
- Catalogued freshly shared Supabase evidence bundle (`artifacts/logs/supabase_decision_sample.ndjson`, `artifacts/monitoring/supabase-sync-summary-latest.json`) for use in AI training kits; preparing doc updates next.
- Staging check blocked: curl to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app` returned `Failed to connect to server`, so training agenda updates stay on hold until deployment confirms host availability.

## AI Kit Refresh — 2025-10-10 03:04 UTC
- Updated all AI facilitator packets (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/*`) with Supabase sample IDs 101–104 so operators rehearse success/retry/timeout evidence paths ahead of staging access.
- Added evidence reminder blocks to the dry run training packet (`docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`) and README to point facilitators at the bundled NDJSON + summary.
- Next step once staging host responds: fold access workflow into `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md` and circulate packet links to product/support; pending deployment confirmation.

## Direction Check-in — 2025-10-10 04:19 UTC
- Re-read `docs/directions/enablement.md` (last_reviewed 2025-10-10; no changes) and confirmed sprint focus priorities: AI kit publication, staging access integration, Supabase evidence alignment.
- Standing tasks: awaiting staging host confirmation before updating `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`; continue monitoring Supabase evidence drops for immediate job aid refresh.

## Staging Host Probe — 2025-10-10 04:19 UTC
- `curl -I https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app` now returns HTTP/2 410 (Gone). Host responds but still unusable for training agenda updates.
- Holding on folding staging steps into the agenda and packet distribution until deployment signals the URL is stable again or provides alternate access.

## Agenda Update — 2025-10-10 04:21 UTC
- Refreshed `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md` with staging verification guidance (require 200/302, escalate on 410) and Supabase sample rehearsal note (IDs 101–104) so facilitators can keep prep moving despite degraded staging.
- Packet distribution still waiting on deployment confirmation that the Fly host will return 200; will notify product/support as soon as the environment stabilizes.

## Dry Run Packet Sync — 2025-10-10 04:21 UTC
- Added staging reachability check and escalation guidance to `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md`; Q&A capture now calls out logging 410 responses and pausing if OCC fails inside Shopify Admin.
- Packet + agenda now aligned on using sample Supabase IDs until live telemetry is back; next action is notifying stakeholders the moment deployment confirms a healthy response.

## Direction Refresh — 2025-10-10 06:19 UTC
- Re-read `docs/directions/enablement.md` (latest sprint focus now includes QA readiness evidence handoff) and confirmed priorities: distribute refreshed AI kits, verify staging host, sync Supabase evidence, and capture QA suite highlights once delivered.
- Standing actions: waiting on deployment for stable staging response, prepping to append QA evidence to job aids when readiness suite lands, and ready to share packet with product/support once go-ahead received.

## Staging Probe — 2025-10-10 06:20 UTC
- Repeat curl check to `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app` continues to return HTTP/2 410 (Gone). Deployment/reliability still needed before we can distribute the packet or run live agenda rehearsal.

## Modal Job Aid Refresh — 2025-10-10 06:53 UTC
- Updated CX Escalations and Sales Pulse modal job aids (`docs/enablement/job_aids/cx_escalations_modal.md`, `.../sales_pulse_modal.md`) to reflect the live modal layout (conversation history, internal note capture, action dropdown) and linked the annotated SVG assets.
- Synced the dry-run annotation callouts doc (`docs/enablement/job_aids/annotations/2025-10-16_dry_run_callouts.md`) so facilitator scripts match the new button labels and internal note emphasis.
- Coordinated with AI prompt owners on modal-specific prompt snippets (`app/prompts/modals/*`) to keep evidence capture and copy guidance aligned once staging stabilises.
- Pending: distribution to product/support still blocked on staging HTTP 410; once deployment confirms 200/302 we will send the refreshed packet and solicit acknowledgements.

## Direction Refresh — 2025-10-10 09:12 UTC
- Manager directive: distribute the Shopify sync rate-limit coaching guide to support/product today; capture their feedback and required follow-ups in this log.
- Link refreshed AI dry-run kits (Sales Pulse, CX Escalations, inventory heatmap) in the outreach and flag Supabase evidence placeholders so packets can be updated once secrets/decision logs land.
- Coordinate with QA/deployment on Supabase staging evidence expectations so job aids are ready to update immediately after handoff.

## Shopify Install Push — 2025-10-10 10:21 UTC
- Once product/integrations confirm Shopify credentials live, send the rate-limit coaching snippet + AI training kit links to support/product; log acknowledgement times and any requested tweaks.
- Prepare facilitator notes that reference the staging store login flow and Supabase telemetry evidence paths so dry-run participants have current instructions.
- Capture outstanding questions or missing artefacts in this file and `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md` so follow-ups are traceable.

## 2025-10-10 Enablement Agent Update (Dry Run Packet)
- Acknowledged latest enablement direction (`docs/directions/enablement.md`) and confirmed `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md` is now staged; coordinating with integrations on adoption timeline.
- Support circulated `docs/runbooks/shopify_dry_run_checklist.md`; reviewing dependencies and aligning enablement owners for T-24/T-12 prep tasks.
- Need enablement owner assignments for dry run recording + Q&A notes (checklist T-24 item 4); please confirm names + backups so agenda can be updated before invites send.
- Q&A capture template now live at `docs/runbooks/operator_training_qa_template.md`; enablement to populate attendee/owner fields and prep to log questions in real time.
- Support waiting on enablement readiness signal (staging assets + owner assignments) before sending dry run invites; share go/no-go in this log so support can execute immediately.
- Consolidated Sales Pulse and CX Escalations materials into `docs/enablement/dry_run_training_materials.md` and refreshed AI sample README to align distribution plan.
- Logged outstanding dependencies (design overlays, Supabase secrets, attendee confirmations) and prepped evidence capture workflow ahead of the 2025-10-16 rehearsal.
- Next: distribute packet once assets land, update job aids with annotated screenshots, and sync with product/support on facilitator assignments.
- Update: designer provided annotated modal overlays (`docs/design/assets/modal-*.svg`) and sparkline hover asset; job aids now reference final files and are queued for distribution after staging access confirms.
- Captured Supabase vault path (`vault/occ/supabase/service_key_staging.env`) and monitor bundle references inside the training packet for enablement evidence capture.
- Facilitator roster confirmed with product/support (Product — Justin, Support — Morgan Patel, Enablement — Justin); pending staging access package before sending invites.
- Re-reviewed 2025-10-10 enablement direction update (AI training kits, rate-limit coaching, Supabase evidence alignment) and noted restart cycle checklist availability at `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`.
- Refreshed AI training kits (CX Escalations, Sales Pulse, Inventory Heatmap) with telemetry callouts and facilitation notes; updated README to highlight coverage.
- Circulated Shopify sync rate-limit coaching guide to product/support for feedback (`feedback/product.md`, `feedback/support.md`) ahead of dry-run scheduling.
- Confirmed Supabase evidence capture expectations with product/QA (decision log IDs + screenshots per scenario); awaiting staging secrets validation before finalizing job aid updates.

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Reviewed sprint focus (English-only audit, Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids, dry-run coordination) per `docs/directions/enablement.md`.
- Blocked: currently reallocated to integrations; no capacity to progress enablement tasks until ownership is reassigned.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Began consolidating audit findings into a single checklist to confirm all runbooks reflect English-only scope; waiting on support/marketing acknowledgements before marking complete.
- Drafted dry run coordination ping for product/support to lock 2025-10-16 agenda inputs and attendee roster; responses pending.
- Outlined updates needed in job aids once designer supplies annotated screenshots; holding publishing until assets arrive.

## 2025-10-10 Production Blocker Sweep
- Supabase decision sync fix: tracking reliability updates so enablement materials can reference the restored monitor status once evidence is available.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: coordinating with deployment/support to confirm staging access package contents before sending dry run invites.
- GA MCP readiness: noted dependency in training agenda; waiting on integrations to confirm credential timeline so operator talking points include accurate analytics scope.
- Operator dry run: ready to publish updated job aids immediately after designer shares annotated screenshots; staging access confirmation remains the gating item.
- Coordinated with AI agent to capture first-pass CX Escalations & Sales Pulse dry run samples (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/cx_escalations_training_samples.md`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/sales_pulse_training_samples.md`) and queued review with support.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Focus Kickoff
## 2025-10-09 Production Blockers Update
- Operator dry run: drafted follow-up emails and Q&A template reminders; waiting on staging access + attendee confirmations before distributing.
- Supabase fix dependency: coordinating with support/product to ensure training materials flag current logging limitations until reliability delivers secrets.
- Staging assets: holding job aid screenshot refresh until staging seed and designer overlays are available.

- Re-reviewed operator runbooks for residual localization references and queued edits to confirm English-only messaging before pushing updates.
- Outlined Sales Pulse and CX Escalations job aid structures (callouts/decision tips); waiting on designer overlays and staging screenshots to populate visuals.
- Pinged product and support for confirmation on the 2025-10-16 dry run agenda/logistics; awaiting responses plus staging access package details.
- Blockers: staging seed + screenshot assets still pending, so runbook refresh and job aid exports remain in draft.

## 2025-10-08

**Acknowledgement**: Reviewed updated enablement direction (`docs/directions/enablement.md`) and noted the sprint focus on English-only materials, Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids, and operator dry run prep.

**Status**: Completed English-only audit for runbooks (`docs/runbooks/support_marketing_localization_sync.md`, `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`, `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md`) and staged modal job aids (`docs/enablement/job_aids/sales_pulse_modal.md`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/cx_escalations_modal.md`).

**Next Steps**:
- Sync with Riley Chen (product) and Morgan Patel (support) on 2025-10-16 dry run agenda; request confirmations and collect pre-session questions.
- Coordinate with design for screenshot overlays referenced in the job aids before distributing to operators.
- Track follow-up items and open questions from the audit/job aids in tomorrow's entry if unresolved.

## 2025-10-09 Production Blocker Push
- Operator dry run: consolidated outstanding asks (staging access package, attendee confirmations, Supabase data highlights) and pinged support/product for responses; prepping Memory pre-read shell to publish once metrics arrive from data.
- Supabase fix dependency: awaiting updated incident notes to incorporate mitigation summary into training materials so operators understand rollback path.
- GA MCP readiness: coordinating with integrations to reflect credential status in the job aids; will update checklists when timeline confirmed.
- 19:25 ET: set reminder to re-ping product/support first thing tomorrow if staging package still missing; will finalize pre-read and distribute invites immediately after confirmations land.

**Coordination Updates**:
- 14:35 ET — Sent Slack note to Riley Chen summarizing dry run dependencies (agenda, staging access checklist, job aid links) and requested confirmation on the 2025-10-16 @ 13:00 ET slot plus attendee list by 2025-10-09 EOD.
- 14:36 ET — Sent Slack note to Morgan Patel with the same agenda highlights and asked for support-side pre-session questions so we can bake them into the Q&A template ahead of invites.

**Design Coordination**:
- Shared job aid outlines with design in `feedback/designer.md` and requested annotated screenshots for Sales Pulse and CX Escalations modals once staging captures are available; awaiting delivery timeline from design team.

## 2025-10-08 — Product Coordination
- Product request: confirm staging access package contents (OCC demo shop logins, feature flag checklist, Chatwoot sandbox creds) and provide go/no-go on issuing 2025-10-16 dry run invites by 2025-10-09 EOD. Need confirmation to finalize Memory pre-read bundle.
- Please drop the final attendee roster + enablement success metrics in Memory (scope `ops`) once aligned; product will mirror in the feedback log and backlog artifact.
- Audit in progress: flagging localization references still present in job aids/runbooks so updates align with `docs/directions/enablement.md:26`.
- Drafted Sales Pulse + CX Escalations one-pager outlines for `docs/enablement/job_aids/` delivery per `docs/directions/enablement.md:27`; awaiting annotated visuals from design before publishing.
- Coordinating dry run agenda confirmations with product/support to fulfill `docs/directions/enablement.md:28`, collecting open questions for tomorrow's entry.

## 2025-10-09

**Progress**:
- 09:00 ET — Sent follow-up Slack DM to Riley Chen and Morgan Patel reiterating the 2025-10-16 dry run dependencies (agenda confirmation, attendee list, staging access package) and requesting responses by 12:00 ET for same-day scheduling. No replies yet as of this log.
- Confirmed no replies yet from earlier outreach on the 2025-10-16 dry run; escalation draft prepped in case the 12:00 ET deadline passes without updates.
- Noted from deployment/reliability logs that GitHub `production` secrets, Shopify CLI token, and staging Postgres credentials remain outstanding; job aid finalization depends on those handoffs so operators can reference accurate staging steps during the dry run.
- Reviewed reliability/product logs to snapshot outstanding production blockers: Supabase decision sync monitoring scripts + secrets still pending, staging Postgres credentials awaiting deployment handoff, GA MCP credential delivery blocked on OCC-INF-221.

**Blockers / Dependencies**:
- Need product to confirm the dry run slot, attendee list, and staging access package before sending invites or drafting Memory pre-read.
- Require designer overlays once staging screenshots land to finalize the Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids ahead of the session.

**Next Actions**:
- Follow up with product/support tomorrow morning if confirmations are still missing; prepare escalation note for manager in parallel.
- Monitor reliability/deployment notes for Supabase/secret progress and capture any enablement impacts in this log.
