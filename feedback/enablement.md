# Enablement Agent — Daily Status Log

_Pending staffing update. Acknowledge `docs/directions/enablement.md` upon assignment._

## Direction Sync — 2025-10-09 (Cross-role Coverage)
- Reviewed sprint focus (English-only audit, Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids, dry-run coordination) per `docs/directions/enablement.md`.
- Blocked: currently reallocated to integrations; no capacity to progress enablement tasks until ownership is reassigned.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Began consolidating audit findings into a single checklist to confirm all runbooks reflect English-only scope; waiting on support/marketing acknowledgements before marking complete.
- Drafted dry run coordination ping for product/support to lock 2025-10-16 agenda inputs and attendee roster; responses pending.
- Outlined updates needed in job aids once designer supplies annotated screenshots; holding publishing until assets arrive.

## 2025-10-10 Production Blocker Sweep
- Supabase decision sync fix: tracking reliability updates so enablement materials can reference the restored monitor status once evidence is available.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: coordinating with deployment/support to confirm staging access package contents before sending dry run invites.
- GA MCP readiness: noted dependency in training agenda; waiting on integrations to confirm credential timeline so operator talking points include accurate analytics scope.
- Operator dry run: ready to publish updated job aids immediately after designer shares annotated screenshots; staging access confirmation remains the gating item.
- Coordinated with AI agent to capture first-pass CX Escalations & Sales Pulse dry run samples (`docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/cx_escalations_training_samples.md`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/ai_samples/sales_pulse_training_samples.md`) and queued review with support.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Focus Kickoff
## 2025-10-09 Production Blockers Update
- Operator dry run: drafted follow-up emails and Q&A template reminders; waiting on staging access + attendee confirmations before distributing.
- Supabase fix dependency: coordinating with support/product to ensure training materials flag current logging limitations until reliability delivers secrets.
- Staging assets: holding job aid screenshot refresh until staging seed and designer overlays are available.

- Re-reviewed operator runbooks for residual localization references and queued edits to confirm English-only messaging before pushing updates.
- Outlined Sales Pulse and CX Escalations job aid structures (callouts/decision tips); waiting on designer overlays and staging screenshots to populate visuals.
- Pinged product and support for confirmation on the 2025-10-16 dry run agenda/logistics; awaiting responses plus staging access package details.
- Blockers: staging seed + screenshot assets still pending, so runbook refresh and job aid exports remain in draft.

## 2025-10-08

**Acknowledgement**: Reviewed updated enablement direction (`docs/directions/enablement.md`) and noted the sprint focus on English-only materials, Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids, and operator dry run prep.

**Status**: Completed English-only audit for runbooks (`docs/runbooks/support_marketing_localization_sync.md`, `docs/runbooks/operator_training_agenda.md`, `docs/runbooks/cx_escalations.md`) and staged modal job aids (`docs/enablement/job_aids/sales_pulse_modal.md`, `docs/enablement/job_aids/cx_escalations_modal.md`).

**Next Steps**:
- Sync with Riley Chen (product) and Morgan Patel (support) on 2025-10-16 dry run agenda; request confirmations and collect pre-session questions.
- Coordinate with design for screenshot overlays referenced in the job aids before distributing to operators.
- Track follow-up items and open questions from the audit/job aids in tomorrow's entry if unresolved.

## 2025-10-09 Production Blocker Push
- Operator dry run: consolidated outstanding asks (staging access package, attendee confirmations, Supabase data highlights) and pinged support/product for responses; prepping Memory pre-read shell to publish once metrics arrive from data.
- Supabase fix dependency: awaiting updated incident notes to incorporate mitigation summary into training materials so operators understand rollback path.
- GA MCP readiness: coordinating with integrations to reflect credential status in the job aids; will update checklists when timeline confirmed.
- 19:25 ET: set reminder to re-ping product/support first thing tomorrow if staging package still missing; will finalize pre-read and distribute invites immediately after confirmations land.

**Coordination Updates**:
- 14:35 ET — Sent Slack note to Riley Chen summarizing dry run dependencies (agenda, staging access checklist, job aid links) and requested confirmation on the 2025-10-16 @ 13:00 ET slot plus attendee list by 2025-10-09 EOD.
- 14:36 ET — Sent Slack note to Morgan Patel with the same agenda highlights and asked for support-side pre-session questions so we can bake them into the Q&A template ahead of invites.

**Design Coordination**:
- Shared job aid outlines with design in `feedback/designer.md` and requested annotated screenshots for Sales Pulse and CX Escalations modals once staging captures are available; awaiting delivery timeline from design team.

## 2025-10-08 — Product Coordination
- Product request: confirm staging access package contents (OCC demo shop logins, feature flag checklist, Chatwoot sandbox creds) and provide go/no-go on issuing 2025-10-16 dry run invites by 2025-10-09 EOD. Need confirmation to finalize Memory pre-read bundle.
- Please drop the final attendee roster + enablement success metrics in Memory (scope `ops`) once aligned; product will mirror in the feedback log and backlog artifact.
- Audit in progress: flagging localization references still present in job aids/runbooks so updates align with `docs/directions/enablement.md:26`.
- Drafted Sales Pulse + CX Escalations one-pager outlines for `docs/enablement/job_aids/` delivery per `docs/directions/enablement.md:27`; awaiting annotated visuals from design before publishing.
- Coordinating dry run agenda confirmations with product/support to fulfill `docs/directions/enablement.md:28`, collecting open questions for tomorrow's entry.

## 2025-10-09

**Progress**:
- 09:00 ET — Sent follow-up Slack DM to Riley Chen and Morgan Patel reiterating the 2025-10-16 dry run dependencies (agenda confirmation, attendee list, staging access package) and requesting responses by 12:00 ET for same-day scheduling.
- 12:05 ET — Escalated the silence in #occ-leadership, summarizing outstanding needs and requesting manager support to unblock confirmations.
- Reviewed reliability/product logs to snapshot outstanding production blockers: Supabase decision sync monitoring scripts + secrets still pending, staging Postgres credentials awaiting deployment handoff, GA MCP credential delivery blocked on OCC-INF-221.
- Highlighted that job aid finalization and pre-read distribution depend on GitHub `production` secrets, Shopify CLI token, and staging Postgres credentials landing so operators receive accurate staging guidance.
- Authored `docs/enablement/dry_run_readiness_checklist.md` to track access, infrastructure, materials, and confirmation checkpoints ahead of the session.

**Blockers / Dependencies**:
- Need product to confirm the dry run slot, attendee list, and staging access package before sending invites or drafting Memory pre-read.
- Require designer overlays once staging screenshots land to finalize the Sales Pulse/CX Escalations job aids ahead of the session.

**Next Actions**:
- Await manager guidance or direct responses from product/support; if still blocked by end of day, prep contingency communication for a potential reschedule.
- Monitor reliability/deployment notes for Supabase/secrets progress and capture any enablement impacts in this log.
- Populate the readiness checklist as confirmations arrive and outline contingency steps if infrastructure blockers persist through 2025-10-10.
