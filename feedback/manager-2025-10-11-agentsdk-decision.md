## 2025-10-11T15:00:00Z ‚Äî MANAGER DECISION: LlamaIndex MCP + Agent SDK Architecture

### Executive Summary

CEO approved comprehensive AI agent architecture combining:

1. Google Analytics Direct API integration (immediate)
2. LlamaIndex RAG as HTTP MCP server on Fly.io
3. OpenAI Agent SDK for customer support automation
4. Human-in-the-loop approval workflows

**Cost Impact**: +$10-15/month (LlamaIndex + Agent MCP servers), -$6/month (GA HTTP server destroyed)  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks phased implementation  
**Risk**: Low (phased rollout with approval gates)

---

### Strategic Decisions Made

#### 1. Google Analytics Integration Approach ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Use Direct Google Analytics API (not MCP) for application data fetching

**Rationale**:

- App knows exactly what queries it needs (sessions, landing pages, traffic sources)
- Best performance (no MCP protocol overhead)
- Most reliable (battle-tested Google client library)
- $0 additional infrastructure cost
- Simplest to maintain

**Impact**:

- Destroy Fly.io GA MCP HTTP server (saves $50-70/year)
- Keep local stdio GA MCP for Cursor/dev tools (working perfectly)
- 2-4 hours engineering work to implement

**Owner**: Engineer agent  
**Timeline**: Week 1, Priority 1

---

#### 2. LlamaIndex as MCP Server Architecture ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Deploy LlamaIndex RAG capabilities as HTTP MCP server on Fly.io

**Rationale**:

- Universal access pattern (all agents + dashboard + CLI can use)
- OpenAI Agent SDK natively supports MCP tool calling
- Clean service boundaries (RAG isolated from agent orchestration)
- Independent scaling and versioning
- Reuses completed LlamaIndex workflow (thin wrapper approach)
- Aligns perfectly with existing MCP-first architecture

**Implementation**:

```
apps/llamaindex-mcp-server/  (HTTP MCP endpoint)
  ‚Üì wraps
scripts/ai/llama-workflow/   (existing CLI, completed 2025-10-11)
  ‚Üì exposes
MCP Tools: query_support, refresh_index, insight_report
  ‚Üì used by
Agent SDK + Dashboard + Dev tools
```

**Cost**: ~$5-10/month (Fly.io 512MB instance with auto-stop)  
**Owner**: Engineer agent (implementation) + AI agent (optimization)  
**Timeline**: Week 1

---

#### 3. OpenAI Agent SDK for Customer Support ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Build agent orchestration using official OpenAI Agent SDK

**Rationale**:

- Production-grade state management and error handling
- Built-in approval workflows (`needsApproval` flag)
- Human-in-the-loop safety controls
- Structured feedback collection for training
- Multi-agent handoffs (triage ‚Üí specialists)
- Official support and updates from OpenAI

**Architecture**:

```
Chatwoot Webhook
  ‚Üì
Agent Service (Triage)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Order Support Agent
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ answer_from_docs (LlamaIndex MCP)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ shopify_find_orders (direct)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ shopify_cancel_order (needs approval)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Product Q&A Agent
      ‚îú‚îÄ answer_from_docs (LlamaIndex MCP)
      ‚îî‚îÄ chatwoot_send_reply (needs approval)
```

**Approval Queue**:

- Operators see pending actions in HotDash dashboard
- One-click approve/reject
- Full audit trail
- Training data captured automatically

**Cost**: ~$5-10/month (Fly.io deployment) + OpenAI API usage  
**Owner**: Engineer agent  
**Timeline**: Week 2-3
