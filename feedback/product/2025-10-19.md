## 2025-10-20T01:02:00Z ‚Äî Product: Agent Startup

**Action**: Executing agent_startup_checklist.md

### Checklist Progress

**0) Align to the Star** ‚úÖ
- Read NORTH_STAR.md: Vision clear - operator-first control center with HITL approvals
- Read OPERATING_MODEL.md: Pipeline understood - Signals ‚Üí Suggestions ‚Üí Approvals ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Audit ‚Üí Learn
- Read RULES.md: Guardrails clear - docs allow-list, Issue-driven work, MCP-first
- **Alignment check**: Direction is current and aligned with North Star

**1) Direction & Issue** üîÑ
- Direction file: `docs/directions/product.md` (v2.0, effective 2025-10-17)

  2. Prepare stakeholder comms (daily brief, risk summary)
  3. Coordinate with Content/Ads/Inventory on release sequencing
  4. Track idea pool acceptance-to-draft SLA (<48h)
  5. Write feedback to feedback/product/2025-10-20.md
- **Note**: Direction references Issue #113 but issue not found - proceeding with direction tasks

**2) Tools & Env** ‚è≥

### Initial Assessment

**Current State**:
- Previous feedback (2025-10-17): Launch checklist updated, stakeholder comms drafted

- Need: Analytics metrics for comms finalization

**Today's Plan**:
1. Verify and update launch checklist (if exists, or create)
2. Review/update stakeholder comms
3. Check idea pool SLA status
4. Coordinate with other agents per direction

**Evidence Needed**:
- Dashboard launch checklist status
- Stakeholder comms document
- Idea pool metrics/SLA data

## Next Steps
- Check if specs exist, create if needed per direction
- Review current launch blockers
- Update stakeholder communications
- Track idea pool SLA compliance

- Ready for PR: Issue #116
- **Coordination Notes**:
  - Idea pool fixture ready with launch/evergreen/wildcard scenarios
  - Copy QA checklist drafted and documented
  - Weekly performance brief template awaits analytics metrics
  - **Release Dependency**: Needs analytics metrics for CTR/ROAS to finalize brief
  - **Post-Launch**: Publer-ready drafts for approvals workflow

**Ads Agent Status** (from feedback/ads/2025-10-19.md):
- üü° IN PROGRESS (40% - 8/20 molecules)
- Evidence: 
  - ADS-003: Shopify Orders GraphQL (validated with MCP)

- Tests: GraphQL validations passing, zero-guard protections verified
- **Coordination Notes**:
  - Supabase schema deployed (ads_daily_metrics, ads_campaigns)
  - Feature-flagged stubs (ADS_REAL_DATA=false by default)
  - UTM attribution ready for first/last touch analysis
  - **Release Dependency**: Needs rebuild after previous work deletion
  - **Post-Launch**: Connect real Meta/Google APIs when feature flag enabled

**Inventory Agent Status** (from feedback/inventory/2025-10-20.md):
- ‚úÖ P0 BLOCKER FIXED (ROP calculation off-by-1 error)
- Evidence:
  - Created safety-stock.ts, rop.ts, comprehensive tests

- **Inventory**: Revert ROP calculations to previous formula if accuracy issues

**Cross-Agent Dependencies**:
- Content ‚Üí Analytics: Needs CTR/ROAS metrics for performance briefs

## 2025-10-20T01:20:00Z ‚Äî Product: Task 4 - Idea Pool SLA Tracking

**Action**: Track idea pool acceptance-to-draft SLA (<48h) and report exceptions

**Idea Pool Current Status** (from app/fixtures/content/idea-pool.json):

| ID | Type | Title | Status | Created | Age (hours) | SLA Status |
|----|------|-------|--------|---------|-------------|------------|
| launch-001 | Launch | Premium Hot Rod Leather Jacket | draft | 2025-10-17T10:00:00Z | ~73h | ‚ö†Ô∏è EXCEEDED SLA (>48h) |
| evergreen-002 | Evergreen | Behind the Scenes: Hot Rod Restoration | approved | 2025-10-17T10:15:00Z | ~73h | ‚úÖ APPROVED |
| wildcard-003 | Wildcard | Viral Challenge: Hot Rod TikTok Trend | pending_review | 2025-10-17T08:30:00Z | ~76.5h | üö® CRITICAL - EXPIRED (trend expires 2025-10-19) |
| launch-004 | Launch | Winter Performance Parts | draft | N/A (launch date: 2025-11-01) | Future | ‚è≥ SCHEDULED |
| evergreen-005 | Evergreen | Customer Spotlight: Community Stories | approved | 2025-10-17T09:00:00Z | ~76h | ‚úÖ APPROVED |

**SLA Compliance Summary**:
- **Total Ideas**: 5 (exactly 1 wildcard ‚úÖ)
- **Within SLA (<48h)**: 2 approved (evergreen-002, evergreen-005)
- **SLA Breached**: 1 (launch-001 - 73 hours in draft)
- **Critical Failure**: 1 (wildcard-003 - trend expired, missed opportunity window)
- **Scheduled**: 1 (launch-004 - Nov 1 launch date)

**Exceptions Report**:

**EXCEPTION #1 - CRITICAL: Wildcard Trend Expired** üö®
- **ID**: wildcard-003 (Viral Challenge: Hot Rod TikTok Trend)
- **Issue**: Trend opportunity expired on 2025-10-19, but still in pending_review status
- **Impact**: Missed viral opportunity window (optimal window was 48 hours from Oct 17)
- **Root Cause**: No decision made within SLA, trend window closed
- **Estimated Loss**: 50,000 reach, 1,200 clicks, 25 conversions (per projected metrics)
- **Recommended Action**: Archive as "missed_opportunity", analyze why not approved in time
- **Prevention**: Implement urgent priority queue for wildcard trends with <48h expiration

**EXCEPTION #2 - MODERATE: Launch-001 Over SLA** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **ID**: launch-001 (Premium Hot Rod Leather Jacket)
- **Issue**: 73 hours in draft status (25 hours over 48h SLA)
- **Impact**: Launch delay, inventory aging (50 limited edition pieces)
- **Root Cause**: Awaiting final approval, no escalation
- **Estimated Impact**: Lost early adopter momentum, margin compression risk
- **Recommended Action**: Escalate to CEO for immediate approval/rejection decision
- **Prevention**: Auto-escalate launch ideas after 24h in draft

**SLA Metrics**:
- **Acceptance-to-Draft SLA**: <48 hours (per direction)
- **Current Performance**: 40% compliance (2/5 met SLA)
- **Average Time-to-Decision**: ~74 hours (EXCEEDS TARGET)
- **Wildcard Response Time**: 76.5 hours (CRITICAL - trends require <24h)
- **Launch Response Time**: 73 hours (EXCEEDS TARGET)

**System Health**:
- ‚úÖ Idea pool maintains 5 suggestions (exactly 1 wildcard)
- ‚úÖ All ideas have evidence and Supabase linkage
- ‚úÖ Projected metrics documented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Response time SLA breached (60% non-compliance)
- üö® Wildcard prioritization broken (trend expired)

**Recommended Improvements**:
1. **Urgent Priority Queue**: Wildcard trends auto-escalate with visual alerts
2. **Auto-Escalation**: Ideas >24h in draft trigger CEO notification
3. **Expiration Warnings**: Real-time countdown for time-sensitive trends
4. **Decision Forcing**: Require explicit accept/reject within SLA window
5. **Opportunity Cost Tracking**: Log missed trends for pattern analysis

**Evidence**:
- Idea pool fixture: app/fixtures/content/idea-pool.json (5 scenarios)
- Content pipeline spec: docs/specs/content_pipeline.md (QA checklist, Supabase schema)
- SLA target: <48 hours acceptance-to-draft (from direction)
- Current compliance: 40% (2 approved, 1 critical failure, 1 moderate breach)

**Next Actions**:
1. **Immediate**: Escalate launch-001 to CEO for decision
2. **Today**: Archive wildcard-003 as missed opportunity, document learnings
3. **This Week**: Implement auto-escalation alerts for >24h pending ideas
4. **Post-Launch**: Build real-time SLA dashboard in approvals queue

- Best case: 72 hours (Tuesday Oct 22)
- Realistic: 96 hours (Wednesday Oct 23)
