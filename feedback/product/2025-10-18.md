# Product — Feedback — 2025-10-18

## Status Summary

- Updated launch checklist with latest gate results (fmt/lint/test) and refreshed blocker section.
- Re-ran `npm run fmt`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test:ci`; captured failures (archived JSON corruption, lint debt, missing test helper/ESM config).
- Confirmed secrets scan already passed per DevOps log; left monitoring and stakeholder items in queue.

## Evidence

- `docs/specs/dashboard_launch_checklist.md`
- `docs/runbooks/ai_agent_review_checklist.md`
- `/tmp/product_plan.json`

## Blockers / Risks

- `npm run fmt` stops on archived JSON; need cleanup before gate can pass.
- `npm run lint` still shows >500 errors (unused vars, `any` types, missing aliases).
- `npm run test:ci` failing on `tests/utils/render` import and `react-router` ESM interop.
- Analytics GA4 + Supabase export and staging apply window (#104/#111) remain unscheduled.
- CEO go/no-go reply still pending; reminder scheduled for 2025-10-19 17:00 if silent.
- QA HITL throughput metrics not yet attached; required before launch sign-off.

## Next Steps

1. Partner with engineering to schedule fmt cleanup + lint/test debt fix, then rerun gates.
2. Sync with analytics and DevOps owners on export/apply timelines; capture confirmations.
3. Send CEO reminder if no response by scheduled time and log outcome in feedback.
4. Collect QA HITL throughput evidence and add to launch packet artifacts once tests resume.

## Manager Sync

- Launch checklist + gate table refreshed with current blockers (fmt, lint, test). fmt is stuck on archived JSON, lint/test still failing on legacy debt, scan already green.
- Analytics export, staging apply, and CEO approval remain outstanding; reminders queued for 2025-10-19.
- Holding for direction on sequencing the fmt cleanup vs lint/test fixes and whether to reprioritize any of the pending owner follow-ups.

### Shutdown — 01:01

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #113 — PR: n/a — Branch: n/a (manager-controlled)
- DoD completion: Checklist + comms in progress; gates still red (fmt/lint/test), other tasks awaiting owners.
- What changed since last entry:
  - Re-ran fmt/lint/test to capture current failures.
  - Updated launch checklist gate table + blockers reflecting new failures.
  - Logged manager sync note requesting direction on debt cleanup sequencing.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: `npm run fmt` (timeouts due to archived JSON), `npm run lint` (500+ errors), `npm run test:ci` (missing helper + ESM interop) — console transcripts above.
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: none today (MCP CLI still blocked per earlier attempts).

**Blockers**

- Fmt cleanup for archived JSON → **owner**: Engineering/Docs (needs allowed cleanup) — **ETA**: pending direction.
- Lint/test debt (unused vars, missing helpers, ESM config) → **owner**: Engineering/QA — **ETA**: pending fixes.
- Analytics export + staging apply scheduling → **owner**: Analytics/Data & DevOps — **ETA**: 2025-10-19 target per lane plans.

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Check with engineering on scheduled fmt cleanup + lint/test remediation slice; rerun gates once addressed.
2. Follow up with analytics/devops/CEO lanes for export, staging window, and approval updates; refresh launch packet accordingly.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 2 (documentation updated but gates still red due to upstream debt)
- Evidence quality: 4 (captured command outputs and references)
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 4

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Kept launch checklist and plan artifacts current with exact gate failures.
  2. Captured concrete blocker details (file paths, owner lanes) for fmt/lint/test gates.
  3. Logged manager sync promptly once new blockers surfaced.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Coordinate earlier with engineering on archival JSON cleanup to avoid late fmt timeout.
  2. Attempt MCP tooling workaround sooner to gather analytics evidence if still blocked.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Waiting to log gate failures until after multiple retries; document the first failure once confirmed.

## Runbook Execution — 18:11

- Aligned to Product direction and lanes for 2025-10-18; Autopublish confirmed OFF in `reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-18.json`.
- Tools: Shopify via MCP available (verification script partially ran); GA4 via adapters confirmed in `app/config/ga.server.ts` and unit tests using mock/direct paths; GSC integration remains stubbed in SEO modules.

### Checks

- `npm run fmt` → FAILED due to JSON syntax in:
  - `docs/specs/hitl/ads-analytics.config.json` (missing comma before `optionalIntegrations`)
  - `docs/specs/hitl/social-publishing.config.json` (missing comma before `compliance`)
    (Out of Product allowed paths; not modified.)
- `npm run lint` → 484 problems (479 errors, 5 warnings) across tests and app code (unused vars, `any` types, import duplicates).
- `npm run test:ci` → Vitest ran; 2 files failed (8 tests) including approvals drawer expectation and social API auth mock; e2e/a11y/lighthouse not executed due to early failure.
- `npm run scan` → PASS (no leaks found).

### Artifacts

- Stakeholder comms template added: `docs/specs/stakeholder_comms.md`.
- Logs: `/tmp/fmt.log`, `/tmp/lint.log`, `/tmp/testci.log`, `/tmp/scan.log` (local session).

### Next Steps

1. Assign JSON syntax fixes to owning lane (HITL specs) so `fmt` can pass.
2. Triage `social.api` tests: provide `authenticate` mock or adjust route to accept injected auth in test env.
3. Re-run `test:ci` including Playwright/a11y/Lighthouse once unit suite is green.
4. Populate stakeholder comms with live metrics once GA4 export lands (adapters path), keep Autopublish OFF.

### Product DoD — 2025-10-18

- HITL checklist present and linked from launch checklist and AI-Customer direction.
- Launch checklist updated with owners/ETAs in Blockers section.
- Stakeholder comms template created and linked; includes release sequencing and rollback notes.
- Feedback log updated with evidence and artifacts. Engineering/QA debt documented; no out-of-scope code changes made.

---

## Manager Update — 18:15

Summary

- Autopublish: OFF (per lanes). Tools: Shopify via MCP; GA4/GSC via adapters. Product slice limited to docs + feedback.
- Created stakeholder comms template and enriched launch checklist with owners/ETAs.

Gate Status

- fmt: FAIL — JSON syntax errors in HITL configs (outside Product paths)
- lint: 484 problems (Engineering/QA debt)
- test:ci: 8 failures (Shopify `authenticate` mock missing; approvals button state assert)
- scan: PASS (no leaks)

Blockers (owners/ETAs)

- JSON cleanup (Engineering, 2025-10-19)
- Lint sweep (Engineering #107, 2025-10-20)
- Social API tests/mocks + ESM config (QA/Eng #114, 2025-10-20)
- GA4 + Supabase export (Analytics #104, 2025-10-19)
- Staging apply window (DevOps/Data #111, 2025-10-19)
- CEO go/no-go (CEO Office, reminder 2025-10-19 17:00)
- QA HITL throughput evidence (QA #114, 2025-10-19)

Requests for Direction

1. Approve Engineering/QA to patch: JSON commas in HITL configs; add partial mock for `app/shopify.server.authenticate`; address top lint clusters.
2. Confirm GA4 export ETA and whether Product should populate stakeholder comms immediately upon delivery.
3. Confirm DevOps staging apply window timing so Product can capture evidence in launch packet.
4. If desired, I can draft a narrow PR in the Engineering lane to fix JSON + test mocks to unblock fmt/test quickly.

Next Intent (awaiting go)

- Populate stakeholder comms with live GA4 metrics once export lands; rerun checks after Eng/QA patches; keep Autopublish OFF.

### Shutdown — 20:45

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #113 — PR: draft (manager-controlled) — Branch: manager-controlled
- DoD completion: Product slice complete for in-scope tasks; 2 external dependencies pending
- What changed since last entry:
  - Added PSF preview contract + internal-link rules; created wireframe stubs; drafted parity mismatch catalog; prepared PR body with MCP Evidence

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens:
  - Flags harness: artifacts/qa/2025-10-18/flags-smoke.log (3 tests PASS)
  - Parity: artifacts/analytics/2025-10-18/parity.log and parity_mismatch.md
  - Specs updated: docs/specs/hitl/*
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used:
  - Context7: React Router, Polaris, GA4 docs → artifacts/product/2025-10-18/mcp/*.jsonl
  - Shopify DEV MCP: CLI verified; env check + attempt logged → artifacts/seo/2025-10-18/mcp/*

**Blockers**

- Shopify DEV Admin introspection (MetaobjectDefinition) → owner: Integrations/Dev — ETA: when dev admin session available; proof: artifacts/seo/2025-10-18/BLOCKER_CLEAR_metaobject_introspection.md
- Parity re-run (needs staging apply + GA4 export) → owner: DevOps/Data/Analytics — ETA: 2025-10-19 per lanes

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Run Shopify DEV MCP introspection and append JSONL; update PSF spec with confirmed field types/validations
2. Re-run parity after apply/export; update mismatch catalog and close CWV→$$ step

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 4
- Evidence quality: 5
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 4

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Kept continuous momentum with tasks.todo and MCP JSONL evidence per change
  2. Added concrete PSF preview/link rules and CWV parity mismatch catalog with owners/ETAs
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Pull Shopify session earlier to avoid late BLOCKER-CLEAR on introspection
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** Treating turn boundaries as pauses; always ship artifacts per turn
Status → next intent: Resume molecules per reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json (M-001 first).
