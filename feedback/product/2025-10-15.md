- Error rate: <0.5%

**Data Accuracy:**

### Risk Assessment & Mitigations

**High-Risk Items Identified:**
1. MCP Tools Setup (M0) - External dependencies → Comprehensive testing, fallback to cached data
2. AI Draft Generation (M2) - Quality depends on training → Supervised fine-tuning, HITL required
3. Approvals Drawer UI (M2) - Complex UX → User testing, iterative design
4. ROP Calculation (M3) - Accuracy critical → Validate with historical data, manual override
5. Twilio SMS (M4) - External API → Retry logic, fallback to manual
6. SEO Anomaly Detection (M5) - Threshold tuning → False positive monitoring
7. Ayrshare Adapter (M6) - External API → Rate limiting, error handling

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Prototype high-risk features early (spike stories)
- Add buffer time (1.5x effort estimate)
- Plan fallback options (manual workflows)
- Defer P3 high-risk features to future

### Prioritization Recommendations

**Immediate (P0 - Build Now):**
- CI/CD Pipeline (M0)
- Push Protection (M0)
- Docs Allow-List (M0)
- HITL Enforcement (M2)
- Public Reply API (M2)
- Payout Brackets (M3)
- PO CSV Generation (M3)
- Picker Piece Count (M3)
- HITL Posting Workflow (M6)

**Next Sprint (P1 - High Priority):**
- MCP Tools (M0)
- Manager Checklists (M0)
- Approvals Drawer UI (M2)
- AI Draft Generation (M2)
- Grading System (M2)
- ROP Calculation (M3)
- Status Buckets (M3)
- Live Chat Integration (M4)
- SEO Anomaly Detection (M5)

**Backlog (P2-P3 - Defer):**
- All other features can be deferred to future iterations

### Next Steps for Manager

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Review all 9 specification documents
2. Validate alignment with NORTH_STAR and PROJECT_PLAN
3. Create PR with all files
4. Request reviews:
   - QA: Acceptance criteria and test cases
   - Engineer: Technical specs (NFRs, rollback procedures, effort estimates)
   - CEO: User-facing materials (training, demo, UAT, communication templates)

**Pre-Launch Actions:**
1. Approve go/no-go decision criteria
2. Confirm rollback procedures tested
3. Verify monitoring tools configured
4. Schedule CEO training session
5. Prepare launch communications

**Post-Launch Actions:**
1. Execute daily monitoring runbook
2. Conduct weekly check-ins with CEO
3. Review metrics vs targets
4. Plan iteration priorities based on feedback

### Questions for Manager

1. **Prioritization:** Do you agree with the P0/P1/P2/P3 prioritization? Any adjustments needed?
2. **Timeline:** Is the 14-week timeline (M0-M6) realistic given team capacity?
3. **Resources:** Are additional resources needed for high-risk features?
4. **Launch Date:** What is the target launch date for dashboard (M0-M1)?
5. **Review Process:** Who should review each document (QA, Engineer, CEO)?

### Blockers & Dependencies
