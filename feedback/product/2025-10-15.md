# Product Agent Feedback — 2025-10-15

## Startup Checklist Execution

### 0) Align to the Star ✅
- Reviewed `docs/NORTH_STAR.md` - Vision: Trustworthy operator-first control center embedded in Shopify Admin
- Reviewed `docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md` - Pipeline: Signals → Suggestions → Approvals → Actions → Audit → Learn
- Reviewed `docs/RULES.md` - Documentation policy, task workflow, security requirements
- **Alignment Check**: Direction file shows "NOT ACTIVE" status but activation request received
- **Note**: Direction file states "Prerequisites: Foundation milestone complete" but tasks assigned for foundation work

### 1) Direction & Issue ⚠️
- Read `docs/directions/product.md` - Status: NOT ACTIVE
- **Issue**: No GitHub Issue number provided in activation request
- **Tasks Assigned**:
  1. Write foundation milestone PRD with user stories, success metrics, acceptance criteria
  2. Create feature prioritization matrix for M0-M6 with impact/effort scores, dependencies, milestone assignments
- **Branch**: `agent/product/foundation-prd`
- **Allowed paths**: Not yet defined (need Issue creation)

### 2) Tools & Env
- Current branch: `agent/integrations/api-foundation` (need to switch)
- MCP tools: Not required for documentation work
- Environment: Ready for documentation creation

### 3) Sandbox & Branch
- **Action needed**: Create branch `agent/product/foundation-prd`
- **Scope**: Documentation work in `docs/specs/` and potentially `docs/manager/`

### 4) Feedback Discipline ✅
- Created `feedback/product/2025-10-15.md` (this file)
- Will maintain append-only entries throughout work

## Today's Plan

### Task 1: Foundation Milestone PRD
**Objective**: Create comprehensive PRD for foundation milestone (M0-M1) aligned with NORTH_STAR

**Scope from NORTH_STAR**:
- M0-M1: Governance + Incident Zero (CI/Rulesets, Chatwoot Email, inventory read-only)
- M2: HITL Customer Agent (Email); Shopify Admin reads; grading to Supabase
- M3: Inventory Actions (ROP, PO CSV, picker payouts)
- M4: Live Chat + SMS; review SLA dashboards
- M5: Growth v1 (read-only analytics + recs)
- M6: HITL Posting (approve-to-post) + weekly growth report tile

**PRD Components**:
1. User stories for each milestone
2. Success metrics (from NORTH_STAR)
3. Acceptance criteria (aligned with DoD)
4. Dependencies and risks
5. Rollback plans

### Task 2: Feature Prioritization Matrix
**Objective**: Create M0-M6 prioritization matrix with impact/effort scoring

**Framework**: Will use RICE-inspired approach found in existing docs
- Reach: How many users/operators affected
- Impact: Operator time savings + customer experience improvement
- Confidence: Based on evidence and technical feasibility
- Effort: Person-weeks (molecule-sized ≤ 2 days)

**Deliverables**:
1. Prioritization matrix spreadsheet/table
2. Impact scores (1-5 scale)
3. Effort estimates (in molecules)
4. Dependencies mapping
5. Milestone assignments (M0-M6)

## Blockers & Questions

### Blocker 1: No GitHub Issue
- **Impact**: Cannot create PR without Issue linkage
- **Action needed**: Manager to create Issue with:
  - Agent: product
  - Definition of Done
  - Acceptance checks
  - Allowed paths (likely `docs/specs/**, docs/manager/**`)

### Question 1: Direction File Status
- Direction file shows "NOT ACTIVE" but tasks assigned
- Should direction file be updated to ACTIVE status?
- Prerequisites state "Foundation milestone complete" but tasks are FOR foundation

### Question 2: Coordination with QA
- Activation request mentions "Coordinate with QA for acceptance criteria"
- Should I wait for QA agent input or proceed with draft?
- Recommendation: Proceed with draft, request QA review in PR

### Question 3: Allowed Paths
- PRD will likely go in `docs/specs/foundation_milestone_prd.md`
- Prioritization matrix could go in `docs/specs/feature_prioritization_matrix.md` or `docs/manager/`
- Need confirmation on allowed paths before creating branch

## Next Steps

1. **BLOCKED**: Await manager to create GitHub Issue with DoD and Allowed paths
2. Create branch `agent/product/foundation-prd` once Issue available
3. Draft Foundation Milestone PRD
4. Draft Feature Prioritization Matrix
5. Coordinate with QA for acceptance criteria review
6. Create PR with evidence and Issue linkage

## Time Estimate
- Foundation PRD: 1.5 days (research + writing + iteration)
- Prioritization Matrix: 0.5 days (analysis + documentation)
- Total: 2 days (within molecule size limit)

**Status**: ⏸️ PAUSED - Awaiting GitHub Issue creation
**Blocker**: Need Issue #<number> with DoD and Allowed paths to proceed
**ETA**: Can complete within 2 days once unblocked
