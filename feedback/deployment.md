## Performance Self-Review — 2025-10-12 Session

### What I Performed Well ✅

1. **Systematic Task Execution**
   - Completed all 19 manager-assigned tasks with evidence
   - Each task logged with timestamps, commands, and outputs
   - Used Fly MCP tools exclusively (no reliance on training)
   - Zero skipped tasks, moved past blockers immediately as directed

2. **Evidence-Based Reporting**
   - Every task completion included specific command outputs
   - Created comprehensive evidence bundle
   - Clear blocker identification (2 non-blocking issues logged)
   - Git workflow followed correctly (deployment/work branch, proper commits)

### What I Really Screwed Up ❌

**MAJOR VIOLATION: Created Files in Wrong Locations**
- Initially created files in `/home/justin/docs/`, `/home/justin/scripts/`
- Violated "work in repo only" principle from direction file
- Created confusion by not working in `/home/justin/HotDash/hot-dash` from start
- Had to be corrected by user before proceeding
- **Root cause**: Jumped into execution without verifying working directory first
- **Impact**: Wasted time, created files that had to be cleaned up

### Changes for Next Startup 🔧

1. **Pre-Work Directory Verification**
   - FIRST ACTION: `cd /home/justin/HotDash/hot-dash && pwd`
   - Verify in correct repo before ANY file creation
   - Add to startup checklist: "Confirm working directory FIRST"

2. **Re-Read Non-Negotiables**
   - Review direction file's NON-NEGOTIABLES section before starting
   - Especially: "Feedback Process Sacred" (one feedback file only)
   - Especially: "No New Files Ever" (Manager approval required)
   - Would have prevented the wrong-location file creation mistake

### North Star Alignment Assessment 📊

**North Star**: "Ensure operators see actionable tiles TODAY for Hot Rod AN"

**My Alignment**: 7/10 (Good but could be better)

**What Aligned Well**:
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments ensure operators never experience outages
- ✅ Auto-scaling ensures operators don't hit slow performance as traffic grows
- ✅ Incident response procedures enable fast recovery if operators affected
- ✅ Monitoring ensures we catch issues before operators see them

**What Could Be Better**:
- ⚠️ Tasks were infrastructure-focused, not explicitly operator-impact-focused
- ⚠️ Could have framed every task in terms of operator value
- ⚠️ Could have prioritized operator-facing monitoring (approval queue depth, response times)
- ⚠️ Missed opportunity to verify approval queue functionality during smoke tests

**Next Time**:
- Frame every infrastructure task as "How does this help operators TODAY?"
- Test operator-facing features, not just health endpoints
- Monitor operator-specific metrics (approval queue, AI response quality)
- Think "operator experience" not just "service uptime"

---

**Self-Assessment Score**: 7/10
- Execution: 9/10 (all tasks complete with evidence)
- Direction following: 6/10 (file location violation)
- North Star alignment: 7/10 (infrastructure focus vs operator focus)
- Communication: 8/10 (clear feedback, evidence-based)

**Key Lesson**: Always verify working directory FIRST. Infrastructure is not the end goal - operator value is.
