## üìä UPDATED SPRINT SUMMARY - Manager Direction Applied

### ‚úÖ ALL TASKS EXECUTED PER UPDATED DIRECTION (5/5)

**Direction Changes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **Shopify MCP validation** - Used dev MCP instead of guessing endpoints  
- ‚úÖ **Required secrets only** - Identified embed/session tokens for removal
- ‚úÖ **Chatwoot scope clarified** - Readiness docs in docs/integrations/, ops in feedback/chatwoot.md

Ready for next assignment or task prioritization update.

## 2025-10-11 03:32 UTC - Chatwoot Migration Attempts and Blocker Logged
Action: Executed two non-interactive migration attempts as per direction; both failed due to Supabase session pooler MaxClientsInSessionMode. Scaled worker to 0, set SECRET_KEY_BASE via secrets import, re-attempted migration, then restored worker to 1. Health probe shows /api 200, /hc 404 (knowledge center route); fly.toml http_check remains on /api.
Evidence:
- Artifacts root: artifacts/integrations/chatwoot-fly-deployment-2025-10-11T03:19:56Z/
- fly_whoami.txt, fly_secrets_set_postgres_redis.txt, fly_scale_memory.txt, health_probes.txt
- rails_db_prepare.txt (contains PG session pool limit errors x2)
- fly_scale_count.txt (worker scaled 0 ‚Üí 1)
Requested next steps (manager/deployment):
- Provide direct Postgres DSN (non-pooler) or temporarily increase Supabase session pool size; alternatively approve a brief maintenance window to stop web and run a one-off migration machine with app secrets.
