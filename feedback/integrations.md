# Integrations Agent â€” Daily Status Log

## 2025-10-08 Integration Dashboard
| Vendor | Sandbox Status | Live Status | Credentials | Tests | Blockers / Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GA MCP | Mock dataset healthy; typed client ready (`app/services/ga/mcpClient.ts`) | ðŸš« Blocked â€” mock mode only | OCC-INF-221 pending infra delivery (`GA_MCP_HOST`, `GA_MCP_CREDENTIALS`) | Contract tests staged (`tests/unit/contracts/ga.sessions.contract.test.ts`) awaiting live host | Manager coordinating with infra at 18:30 UTC for ETA; see `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`. |
| Social Sentiment â€” Hootsuite POC | Not yet stood up; plan finalized | N/A (POC gating) | Vendor contract + Shopify app OAuth pending | Typed client + contract tests to be authored (`packages/integrations/social/hootsuiteClient.ts`) | Await Hootsuite rate-limit docs (ticket HS-44721) and contract packet (`docs/integrations/hootsuite_contract_checklist.md`). |
| Social Sentiment â€” Native APIs (X + Meta) | No sandbox yet; specs drafted in marketing plan | N/A | Requires X Premium + Meta tokens (not requested) | Test harness depends on NLP pipeline; not started | Contingency path onlyâ€”monitor budget approval; revisit after Hootsuite POC. |
| Supabase Add-ons | Existing Supabase instance in use; add-ons not provisioned | Live usage limited to core DB | Secrets managed via GitHub/vault; add-on keys not requested | Integration tests covered by existing Supabase suite | Waiting on reliability to publish rotation cadence (due 2025-10-10); no immediate blockers. |
| Zoho CRM | No sandbox; vendor not engaged | N/A | Credentials not requested | Tests not defined | Pending prioritizationâ€”need product requirements before outreach. |

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Focus Kickoff
## 2025-10-09 Production Blockers Update
- GA MCP readiness: tracking OCC-INF-221 sync at 18:30 UTC; prepared onboarding doc sections for host/key delivery plus compliance evidence once infra responds.
- Supabase/staging support: aligned with reliability on secret rotation doc to ensure integration points captured once secrets populate GitHub.
- Operator dry run implication: verifying external vendor touchpoints (Chatwoot, GA MCP) so enablement can rely on stable integrations during rehearsal; pending credential confirmations.
- 19:20 ET: scheduled a fresh OCC-INF-221 follow-up for tomorrow morning; once infra shares host/credential bundle weâ€™ll publish the onboarding update and notify deployment so secrets hit GitHub immediately.

- GA MCP credentials: prepped questions + evidence placeholders ahead of the 18:30 UTC infra sync so `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md` can be updated immediately after; waiting on OCC-INF-221 outcome for host/credential ETA.
- Social sentiment vendor: drafted comparison notes for Hootsuite vs native APIs and listed contract evidence gaps; blocked until HS-44721 rate-limit doc and contract packet arrive.
- Integration readiness dashboard: staged status refresh with latest blockers across vendors; needs inputs from infra/compliance before publishing update.
- Blockers: OCC-INF-221 still unresolved, Hootsuite documentation pending, and GA MCP credential timeline remains unknown.

## Direction Refresh Acknowledgment â€” 2025-10-08
- Confirmed the updated sprint focus in `docs/directions/integrations.md` and aligned dashboard, GA MCP, and sentiment workstreams accordingly.
- Blockers remain: OCC-INF-221 still awaiting infra ETA post-sync, and Hootsuite contract packet plus HS-44721 rate-limit docs needed before compliance/reliability sessions.

## 2025-10-08 â€” Sprint Focus Activation
- Drafted next update for `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md` capturing outstanding credential verification steps per `docs/directions/integrations.md:26`; ready to fill in as soon as infra delivers ETA.
- Partnered with marketing/product on sentiment vendor recommendation summary so decision artifacts align with `docs/directions/integrations.md:27`; awaiting Hootsuite rate-limit document to finalize.
- Began populating the integration readiness dashboard structure with current statuses to meet `docs/directions/integrations.md:28`; evidence links queued for manager review once blockers clear.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Followed up with infrastructure on GA MCP credential timeline; awaiting post-sync notes before updating onboarding checklist with firm dates.
- Prepped sentiment vendor comparison summary for marketing/product decision meeting, including contract considerations and monitoring asks; blocked on receipt of Hootsuite rate-limit documentation (HS-44721).
- Began populating integration readiness dashboard draft with latest statuses so manager/product can review once outstanding evidence lands.

## 2025-10-10 Production Blocker Sweep
- Supabase decision sync: monitoring reliability/engineering updates so integration dashboards reflect the restored monitor path once assets land; no direct action until script delivered.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: coordinating with deployment/reliability to capture secret provisioning evidence, ensuring integration readiness dashboard includes the new GitHub env rows when available.
- GA MCP readiness: top priorityâ€”still waiting on OCC-INF-221 outcome; following up with infra/compliance this afternoon for credential ETA so parity checklist can start.
- Operator dry run: aligning with enablement/product to confirm external vendor contacts (Hootsuite) arenâ€™t needed during rehearsal; noting dependency status in readiness dashboard.

## 2025-10-09 Production Blocker Push
- GA MCP readiness: drafted credential handoff checklist updates (host + secret variable mapping) so automation and compliance evidence can publish immediately after OCC-INF-221; waiting on infra response from todayâ€™s 18:30 UTC sync.
- Supabase fix coordination: synced with reliability/data to ensure integration notes capture the Supabase log export path once delivered, enabling shared visibility across teams.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: confirmed deploymentâ€™s secret list matches integration needs; prepared to validate environment matrix entries when reliability posts vault references.
- Operator dry run: aligned with enablement/support on GA MCP talking points for pre-read; will attach MCP readiness status to Memory once credential path is confirmed.
- Published the draft snapshot at `docs/integrations/integration_readiness_dashboard.md` to capture current credential/test blockers across GA MCP, Hootsuite, Supabase, and Chatwoot.

## Key Updates
- Logged GA MCP credential onboarding plan with infra/compliance/ops touchpoints (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`).
- Manager coordinating with infrastructure at 18:30 UTC to unblock OCC-INF-221; preparing fallback notes pending outcome.
- Added structured section in GA MCP onboarding doc to log post-sync outcome + action items the moment the call concludes (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`).
- Delivered social sentiment vendor recommendation favoring Hootsuite-first approach with native API contingency.
- Drafted Hootsuite contract checklist and stood up evidence package scaffold (`docs/integrations/hootsuite_contract_checklist.md`, `artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/README.md`).
- Scheduled compliance DPIA review (2025-10-09 16:00 UTC) and reliability monitoring sync (2025-10-09 17:00 UTC) to advance sentiment POC readiness.
- Drafted reliability monitoring sync agenda with provisional rate-limit guardrails; awaiting HS-44721 response to finalize (`docs/integrations/reliability_monitoring_agenda.md`).
- Enriched Hootsuite evidence templates (data handling + security questionnaire) so Compliance can drop vendor responses without reformatting (`artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/`).

## Upcoming Actions
- Capture manager/infra sync outcome (scheduled 2025-10-08 18:30 UTC) and update GA MCP onboarding checklist with ETA or fallback steps.
- Populate Hootsuite evidence placeholders ahead of the 2025-10-09 16:00 UTC compliance review.
- Replace provisional rate-limit thresholds in the reliability agenda once vendor documentation arrives; circulate to reliability/marketing pre-sync.
