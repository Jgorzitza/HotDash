# Integrations Agent â€” Daily Status Log

## 2025-10-10 Readiness Refresh (22:55 UTC)
- Verified staging Shopify vault entries (`vault/occ/shopify/*.env`) and captured HTTP 200 `curl -I https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=1` evidence (`artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/curl_hotdash-staging_2025-10-10T02-50-44Z.log`) to confirm Fly host reachability ahead of DEPLOY-147 delivery.
- Drafted OCC-INF-221 escalation ping for the 2025-10-11 09:00 UTC window (`artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/escalation_draft.md`), updated onboarding tracker/contact log, and ready to dispatch if infra stays silent.
- Integration readiness dashboard refreshed to reflect the new Shopify evidence, Supabase vault checks, and the pending infra response before the CIO escalation window.

## 2025-10-10 Escalation & Evidence Refresh (07:23 UTC)
- Captured Shopify CLI secret hash evidence at 07:18 UTC and stored transcript in `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/cli-secret-20251010T071858Z.log`; updated readiness doc to point at the new artifact.
- Posted the DEPLOY-147 follow-up in `#deploy-ops` asking for timestamped QA/product/support invites and audit logs; logged the chase in `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md`.
- Delivered the 07:23 UTC OCC-INF-221 escalation ping in `#infra-requests` (see `artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/escalation_draft.md`) and updated the onboarding tracker/contact log accordingly.
- Drafted GA MCP parity command checklist (`artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/parity_commands.md`) so connectivity, contract tests, and rate-limit probes can kick off as soon as infra delivers credentials.

## 2025-10-10 Shopify Broadcast (07:35 UTC)
- Logged Shopify store invites accepted via admin audit export (`artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-invite-audit-20251010T0730Z.md`) and updated readiness dashboard/action log.
- Sent install broadcast to QA/Product/Support (`artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/install_broadcast_2025-10-10T073500Z.md`) with credential locations, action checklists, and note that DEPLOY-147 now tracks only smoke latency evidence.
- Updated `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` and `docs/integrations/integration_readiness_dashboard.md` to reflect credentials/live access delivered and outstanding latency proof.
- Posted readiness snippet in Linear ticket DEPLOY-147 (`artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/DEPLOY-147-linear-comment-20251010T0736Z.md`) to align with manager directive.

## 2025-10-10 Direction Check (04:19 UTC)
- Re-read `docs/directions/integrations.md`; sprint focus unchanged (OCC-INF-221 credential chase, Shopify staging bundle, readiness dashboard fidelity). Continuing escalation prep and readiness evidence capture per instructions.

## 2025-10-10 Shopify Follow-up Prep (04:22 UTC)
- Staged DEPLOY-147 follow-up draft (`artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/deploy_followup_draft.md`) requesting Shopify staging bundle delivery or ETA before 09:00 UTC to keep readiness dashboard accurate and unblock QA handoff.
- Updated Shopify readiness doc and evidence README with escalation prep details.

## 2025-10-10 Early AM Refresh (06:26 UTC)
- Re-ran Fly host curl at 06:20 UTC (`artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/curl_hotdash-staging_2025-10-10T06-20-00Z.log`) to confirm staging availability ahead of install broadcast requirement; refreshed deployment follow-up draft with new evidence and note to notify QA/product/support once smoke goes green.
- Updated GA MCP escalation draft at 06:24 UTC (`artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/escalation_draft.md`) and onboarding tracker contact log to reflect the pending 09:00 UTC escalation message if infra stays silent.
- 06:34 UTC addendum: `https://hotdash-staging.fly.dev/app?mock=0` returns HTTP 410 (`curl_hotdash-staging_2025-10-10T06-34-12Z_mock0.log`), confirming live path still blocked pending DEPLOY-147 secrets; readiness docs updated to capture evidence.
- 06:36 UTC: Staged install broadcast template (`artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/install_broadcast_template.md`) and CLI secret evidence placeholder so we can drop timestamped artifacts immediately once deployment closes DEPLOY-147.

## 2025-10-10 Direction Check (08:00 UTC)
- Re-read `docs/directions/integrations.md`; no changes detected. Sprint focus and broadcast requirement unchanged. Continuing escalation prep and readiness updates per canon.

## 2025-10-10 Next-Step Recommendations (07:30 UTC)
- Track deployment response in `#deploy-ops`; if DEPLOY-147 bundle or invite timestamps still missing at 09:00 UTC, escalate to manager per direction and capture outcome in `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md`.
- Once deployment ships the bundle, grab Fly `secrets list` output + GitHub audit evidence, drop them next to `cli-secret-20251010T071858Z.log`, and update `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` and broadcast template before notifying QA/product/support.
- Monitor OCC-INF-221 for infra reply; log any updates in `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md` and prep CIO escalation note if no ETA arrives by 2025-10-11 09:00 UTC.
- Coordinate with reliability/data to queue MCP contract test unskip + rate-limit probe so parity validation can commence immediately when credentials land; stage commands in `artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/`.

## 2025-10-10 Direction Review
- Re-read `docs/directions/integrations.md` (last_reviewed: 2025-10-10); priorities remain locked on GA MCP credential chase, Shopify secret delivery, and readiness dashboard upkeep.
- Confirmed canonical restart guidance is tracked at `docs/runbooks/restart_cycle_checklist.md`; aligned integration restart notes with that checklist.
- Direction lines 25-27 explicitly assign integrations to close `DEPLOY-147`, secure Shopify shop access, and keep the readiness dashboard currentâ€”tracking each in `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md` and todayâ€™s action items.

## 2025-10-10 GA MCP Escalation
- Infra missed the 17:00 UTC ETA for OCC-INF-221 credential delivery; manager re-escalated at 17:20 UTC requesting immediate status or fallback.
- Updated onboarding tracker (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`) with missed deadline, new action items, and escalation plan; staged evidence folder (`artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/`).
- Next follow-up: ping infra in #infra-requests at 18:05 UTC if ticket remains silent and prepare CIO escalation note for 2025-10-11 09:00 UTC.

## 2025-10-10 Shopify Secret Bundle Follow-up
- Sent deployment follow-up at 17:30 UTC to close `DEPLOY-147`, deliver Shopify shop access instructions, and confirm secret sync per `docs/directions/integrations.md:24-27`.
- 19:05 UTC: No acknowledgement yet; flagged pending follow-up and drafting escalation note for manager if deployment stays silent.
- Updated readiness brief (`docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`) action log with the follow-up and ensured readiness dashboard reflects the dependency.
- 2025-10-10 04:41 UTC â€” forwarded productâ€™s green smoke artifact (`artifacts/monitoring/synthetic-check-2025-10-10T04-40-48.296Z.json`) to deployment, restating DEPLOY-147 urgency and requesting timestamped store invite evidence; will escalate to manager if no response before 09:00 UTC checkpoint.

## 2025-10-10 Evening Checkpoint (22:30 UTC)
- Supabase staging `DATABASE_URL` confirmed in vault + GitHub; coordinating with QA to refresh `.env.staging` once Shopify credentials land.
- Reliability scheduled to run `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh`; awaiting host + credential bundle to drop evidence in `artifacts/integrations/ga-mcp/2025-10-10/`.
- DEPLOY-147 remains open pending Shopify secrets + store access delivery from deployment; escalation request queued if no response after 19:15 UTC.
- Next actions: ping infra at 18:05 UTC for GA MCP ETA, sync with reliability on MCP helper completion, close DEPLOY-147 immediately after credential handoff, and update readiness docs with evidence.

## 2025-10-10 Direction Execution Refresh
- Re-read `docs/directions/integrations.md` and confirmed sprint focus items: MCP helper coordination, DEPLOY-147 closure, readiness dashboard updates.
- Requested reliability run the MCP staging auth helper with the staging bundle; awaiting host + CLI token to confirm live Shopify credentials drop.
- Prepared store access distribution plan: once bundle arrives, update `vault/occ/shopify/shop_domain_staging.env` with `hotroddash.myshopify.com`, capture evidence in `artifacts/integrations/shopify/2025-10-10/store-access.md`, notify deployment/QA/product, and close DEPLOY-147.
## 2025-10-08 Integration Dashboard
| Vendor | Sandbox Status | Live Status | Credentials | Tests | Blockers / Next Action |

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Focus Kickoff
## 2025-10-09 Production Blockers Update
- GA MCP readiness: tracking OCC-INF-221 sync at 18:30 UTC; prepared onboarding doc sections for host/key delivery plus compliance evidence once infra responds.
- Supabase/staging support: aligned with reliability on secret rotation doc to ensure integration points captured once secrets populate GitHub.
- Operator dry run implication: verifying external vendor touchpoints (Chatwoot, GA MCP) so enablement can rely on stable integrations during rehearsal; pending credential confirmations.
- 19:20 ET: scheduled a fresh OCC-INF-221 follow-up for tomorrow morning; once infra shares host/credential bundle weâ€™ll publish the onboarding update and notify deployment so secrets hit GitHub immediately.

- GA MCP credentials: prepped questions + evidence placeholders ahead of the 18:30 UTC infra sync so `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md` can be updated immediately after; waiting on OCC-INF-221 outcome for host/credential ETA.
- Social sentiment vendor: drafted comparison notes for Hootsuite vs native APIs and listed contract evidence gaps; blocked until HS-44721 rate-limit doc and contract packet arrive.
- Integration readiness dashboard: staged status refresh with latest blockers across vendors; needs inputs from infra/compliance before publishing update.
- Blockers: OCC-INF-221 still unresolved, Hootsuite documentation pending, and GA MCP credential timeline remains unknown.

## Direction Refresh Acknowledgment â€” 2025-10-08
- Confirmed the updated sprint focus in `docs/directions/integrations.md` and aligned dashboard, GA MCP, and sentiment workstreams accordingly.
- Blockers remain: OCC-INF-221 still awaiting infra ETA post-sync, and Hootsuite contract packet plus HS-44721 rate-limit docs needed before compliance/reliability sessions.

## 2025-10-08 â€” Sprint Focus Activation
- Drafted next update for `docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md` capturing outstanding credential verification steps per `docs/directions/integrations.md:26`; ready to fill in as soon as infra delivers ETA.
- Partnered with marketing/product on sentiment vendor recommendation summary so decision artifacts align with `docs/directions/integrations.md:27`; awaiting Hootsuite rate-limit document to finalize.
- Began populating the integration readiness dashboard structure with current statuses to meet `docs/directions/integrations.md:28`; evidence links queued for manager review once blockers clear.

## 2025-10-09 Sprint Execution
- Followed up with infrastructure on GA MCP credential timeline; awaiting post-sync notes before updating onboarding checklist with firm dates.
- Prepped sentiment vendor comparison summary for marketing/product decision meeting, including contract considerations and monitoring asks; blocked on receipt of Hootsuite rate-limit documentation (HS-44721).
- Began populating integration readiness dashboard draft with latest statuses so manager/product can review once outstanding evidence lands.

## 2025-10-10 Production Blocker Sweep
- Supabase decision sync: monitoring reliability/engineering updates so integration dashboards reflect the restored monitor path once assets land; no direct action until script delivered.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: coordinating with deployment/reliability to capture secret provisioning evidence, ensuring integration readiness dashboard includes the new GitHub env rows when available.
- GA MCP readiness: top priorityâ€”still waiting on OCC-INF-221 outcome; following up with infra/compliance this afternoon for credential ETA so parity checklist can start.
- Operator dry run: aligning with enablement/product to confirm external vendor contacts (Hootsuite) arenâ€™t needed during rehearsal; noting dependency status in readiness dashboard.

## Shopify Install Push â€” 2025-10-10 10:16 UTC
- `DEPLOY-147`: coordinate with reliability to run `scripts/deploy/shopify-dev-mcp-staging-auth.sh` so the Shopify CLI generates staging credentials; once the helper outputs new values, confirm theyâ€™re vaulted/mirrored and capture timestamps + secret names in this log and `docs/integrations/shopify_readiness.md`.
- Provide QA with the dedicated staging store access and document contact/permission details so Playwright flows can authenticate without manual intervention.
- Notify deployment and product the moment the secret bundle is live so they can run sync + staging deploy steps; keep the readiness dashboard updated with evidence links.

## 2025-10-09 Production Blocker Push
- GA MCP readiness: drafted credential handoff checklist updates (host + secret variable mapping) so automation and compliance evidence can publish immediately after OCC-INF-221; waiting on infra response from todayâ€™s 18:30 UTC sync.
- Supabase fix coordination: synced with reliability/data to ensure integration notes capture the Supabase log export path once delivered, enabling shared visibility across teams.
- Staging Postgres + secrets: confirmed deploymentâ€™s secret list matches integration needs; prepared to validate environment matrix entries when reliability posts vault references.
- Operator dry run: aligned with enablement/support on GA MCP talking points for pre-read; will attach MCP readiness status to Memory once credential path is confirmed.
- Published the draft snapshot at `docs/integrations/integration_readiness_dashboard.md` to capture current credential/test blockers across GA MCP, Hootsuite, Supabase, and Chatwoot.

## Key Updates
- Logged GA MCP credential onboarding plan with infra/compliance/ops touchpoints (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`).
- Manager coordinating with infrastructure at 18:30 UTC to unblock OCC-INF-221; preparing fallback notes pending outcome.
- Added structured section in GA MCP onboarding doc to log post-sync outcome + action items the moment the call concludes (`docs/integrations/ga_mcp_onboarding.md`).
- Delivered social sentiment vendor recommendation favoring Hootsuite-first approach with native API contingency.
- Drafted Hootsuite contract checklist and stood up evidence package scaffold (`docs/integrations/hootsuite_contract_checklist.md`, `artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/README.md`).
- Scheduled compliance DPIA review (2025-10-09 16:00 UTC) and reliability monitoring sync (2025-10-09 17:00 UTC) to advance sentiment POC readiness.
- Drafted reliability monitoring sync agenda with provisional rate-limit guardrails; awaiting HS-44721 response to finalize (`docs/integrations/reliability_monitoring_agenda.md`).
- Enriched Hootsuite evidence templates (data handling + security questionnaire) so Compliance can drop vendor responses without reformatting (`artifacts/vendors/hootsuite/2025-10-09/`).

## Upcoming Actions
- Capture manager/infra sync outcome (scheduled 2025-10-08 18:30 UTC) and update GA MCP onboarding checklist with ETA or fallback steps.
- Populate Hootsuite evidence placeholders ahead of the 2025-10-09 16:00 UTC compliance review.
- Replace provisional rate-limit thresholds in the reliability agenda once vendor documentation arrives; circulate to reliability/marketing pre-sync.
