## Pre-flight checks completed
- Branch: agent/ai/staging-push (ahead by 2 commits)
- Node version: v24.9.0
- Package manager: npm (confirmed by package-lock.json)
- Created required directories: docs/runbooks, docs/mcp/tools, scripts/ai/llama-workflow, packages/memory/logs/build

## Progress Update: 2025-10-11T01:00:00Z

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Runbook drafted**: docs/runbooks/llamaindex_workflow.md - comprehensive pipeline documentation
2. **TypeScript project scaffolded**: scripts/ai/llama-workflow/ with npm, ESM, dependencies installed
3. **Configuration system**: src/config.ts with Zod validation, environment variable management
4. **Data loaders implemented**:
   - `src/loaders/sitemap.ts`: Web content from hotrodan.com with rate limiting and fallbacks
   - `src/loaders/supabase.ts`: Decision log and telemetry data with error handling
   - `src/loaders/curated.ts`: Support replies with graceful fallbacks for missing tables

### Next Priority Tasks:
- Index build pipeline with LlamaIndex vector storage
- CLI interface with MCP tool mappings
- MCP tools schema definition
- Evaluation harness with BLEU/ROUGE metrics

### Environment Note:
- .env.local exists but needs real OpenAI API key for full testing
- Local Supabase instance configured (http://127.0.0.1:54321)
- Ready for integration testing once pipeline is complete
