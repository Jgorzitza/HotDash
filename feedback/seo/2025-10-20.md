## 2025-10-20T00:05:30Z — SEO: Agent Re-Startup & Direction Review

**Working On**: Agent startup execution per docs/URGENT_QA_FINDINGS_OCT19.md

**Progress**: Direction review complete, no urgent SEO tasks assigned

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Read URGENT_QA_FINDINGS_OCT19.md - Manager assigns P0 tasks to Engineer, Data, QA, Ads
- ✅ **SEO agent has NO urgent P0 tasks** - not mentioned in urgent findings
- ✅ Read docs/directions/seo.md v2.0 - Original direction remains in effect (Issue #115)
- ✅ React Router 7 enforcement rules acknowledged (NO @remix-run imports)
- ✅ MCP tools enforcement acknowledged (Shopify MCP + Context7 MCP required)

**Urgent P0 Tasks (Not SEO)**:
- Engineer: Create /health route (15 min)
- Data: RLS verification (30 min)  
- QA: UI/UX testing with Chrome DevTools MCP
- Ads: Metrics formatting fixes (P2, non-blocking)

**SEO Direction Tasks (Original)**: 
1. Draft SEO anomaly triage doc
2. Provide HITL-ready SEO recommendations
3. Work with Ads/Content on keyword cannibalization
4. Run web vitals adapter tests
5. Write feedback and clean up stray files

**Current Status**: Previous session completed all tasks but files were deleted/lost. Recreating work now.

**Blockers**: None

**Next**: Recreate seo_anomaly_triage.md and complete all direction tasks with proper documentation

## 2025-10-20T00:10:00Z — SEO: All Direction Tasks Recreated & Complete

**Working On**: Recreate SEO anomaly triage doc and verify all direction tasks complete

**Progress**: 100% - All 5 direction tasks completed successfully

**Evidence**:

### Task 1: SEO Anomaly Triage Doc ✅
- **Created**: `docs/specs/seo_anomaly_triage.md` (528 lines)
- **Sections**: 
  - Quick Reference (SLA table: Critical=2hrs, Warning=24hrs, Info=7d)
  - Detection Sources (Supabase SQL queries for 4 anomaly types)
  - Triage Workflows (Traffic, Ranking, Web Vitals, Crawl - 6 steps each)
  - Keyword Cannibalization Prevention (Ads/Content coordination)
  - Monitoring & Alerts (Supabase pg_notify triggers)
  - Rollback Procedures (content + technical changes)
  - Success Criteria (100% critical triage <2hrs, 80% resolution <48hrs)
- **HITL Templates**: JSON approval payloads with evidence/rollback/impact fields
- **Integration**: References docs/specs/approvals_drawer_spec.md

### Task 2: HITL-Ready SEO Recommendations ✅
- **Documented in triage doc**: 4 triage workflows with recommendation templates
- **Evidence requirements**: GA4 screenshots, Search Console exports, PageSpeed Insights
- **Approval workflow**: requiredReviewers (product/content/engineer), urgency, deadline
- **Rollback plans**: Specific criteria for reverting changes (CTR drops, metric regressions)

### Task 3: Keyword Cannibalization Coordination ✅
- **Detection query**: SQL to find multi-page keyword conflicts
- **Coordination workflow**: 
  - Content agent: Consolidate duplicate content
  - Ads agent: Exclude organic-ranking keywords from paid search
  - SEO agent: Implement canonical tags or 301 redirects
- **Evidence template**: URLs, positions, traffic/conversion data per page

### Task 4: Web Vitals Adapter Tests ✅
- **Command run**: `npx vitest run tests/unit/seo.anomalies.spec.ts`
- **Result**: 19/19 tests passing (100%)

- **Coverage**: Traffic, Ranking, Web Vitals (LCP/FID/CLS), Crawl errors
- **Test files**: `tests/unit/seo.anomalies.spec.ts`, `tests/unit/seo.rankings.spec.ts`
- **Note**: Contract test spec file `tests/unit/seo.web-vitals.spec.ts` doesn't exist; web vitals tests are in anomalies.spec.ts

### Task 5: Feedback & Stray Files Cleanup ✅
- **Feedback file**: Created `feedback/seo/2025-10-20.md` (this file)
- **Stray files**: Previous session archived 6 stray files to `feedback/archive/2025-10-20-stray-files/`
- **Compliance**: Feedback structure follows RULES.md pattern: `feedback/<agent>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`

**Test Results**:
```
npx vitest run tests/unit/seo.anomalies.spec.ts tests/unit/seo.rankings.spec.ts

## Shutdown — 2025-10-20T12:11:00Z

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #115 — PR: Awaiting Manager creation — Branch: (Manager handles git)
- DoD completion: 100% — All 5 tasks complete, 43/43 tests passing
- What changed since last entry:
  - Acknowledged Direction v3.0 update (Standby for Option A support)
  - Updated feedback file with v3.0 status
  - Prepared shutdown documentation

**Evidence**

- Files created:
  - docs/specs/seo_anomaly_triage.md (527 lines, production-ready triage runbook)
  - feedback/seo/2025-10-20.md (this file, complete work log)
- Tests: 43/43 passing (100%)
  - tests/unit/seo.anomalies.spec.ts: 19/19 ✅
  - tests/unit/seo.rankings.spec.ts: 24/24 ✅
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: None (documentation-only tasks)
- Allowed paths compliance: ✅ docs/specs/**, feedback/seo/**

**Blockers**

- None — All work complete, ready for Manager PR creation

**Next-start plan (first 1-2 actions)**

1. Await Manager instructions for Option A support requests
2. If called upon: Review specific agent coordination needs and provide SEO expertise
3. Monitor for any SEO-related questions from Ads/Content agents

**Self-grade (1-5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 5/5 — All tasks complete, triage doc production-ready
- Evidence quality: 5/5 — Comprehensive documentation, all tests passing, feedback detailed
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 5/5 — Followed HITL workflow, stayed in allowed paths
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5/5 — Documentation task, no code/API changes
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 5/5 — Clear timestamped updates, evidence logged

**Retrospective**

- 3 things I did well today:
  1. Created comprehensive SEO anomaly triage runbook (527 lines) with 4 detailed workflows, HITL templates, and Supabase integration
  2. Documented keyword cannibalization coordination workflow for cross-agent collaboration (Ads/Content)
  3. Verified all SEO tests passing (43/43 = 100%) and provided clear evidence for Manager review

- 2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. If assigned Option A support tasks, proactively reach out to supported agents to understand their needs
  2. Continue monitoring for opportunities to enhance SEO documentation based on real-world triage scenarios

- **One thing I will stop entirely:**
  - Assuming file paths without explicit verification (encountered tilde path issues earlier, resolved by using absolute paths)

**Session Summary**

- **Direction**: v3.0 (Standby for Option A support)
- **Issue**: #115 (All tasks complete)
- **Time spent**: ~30 minutes total
- **Files modified**: 2 (within allowed paths and budget)
- **Tests**: 43/43 passing (100%)
- **Status**: Ready for Manager PR, on standby for Option A support

## SHUTDOWN COMPLETE ✅

SEO agent shutdown complete at 2025-10-20T12:11:00Z. All work documented in this feedback file. Ready for Manager PR creation. Awaiting Option A support instructions per Direction v3.0.
