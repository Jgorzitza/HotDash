## 2025-10-20T14:26:00Z — Integrations: Updated Direction Review

**Working On**: Re-reading direction files and executing current tasks per user request

**Progress**: Direction review in progress

**Evidence**:

### Direction File Status:
- **File**: docs/directions/integrations.md
- **Version**: 2.0 (Effective 2025-10-17)
- **Current Issue**: #110
- **Last Modified**: Oct 20 08:16 (per ls -lt)

### Date Correction Notice:
- Read URGENT_DATE_CORRECTION.md
- Indicates today is Oct 19 (document dated 2025-10-19)
- However, system date shows 2025-10-20
- Creating 2025-10-20.md feedback file as system date indicates it's Oct 20

### Current Tasks from Direction v2.0:
1. Maintain mocked Supabase contract tests for idea pool/experiments
2. Expose feature flags for real Supabase calls and document activation
3. Coordinate with Ads/Content on Publer adapter evidence
4. Keep integration feedback updated
5. Write feedback to feedback/integrations/2025-10-17.md (NOTE: outdated reference, using current date)

### Previous Work Status:
- Per feedback/integrations/2025-10-19.md: Tasks reported COMPLETE
- Issue #113 work completed (15/15 molecules, 44/44 tests, Manager score 5/5)
- However, direction still shows Issue #110 (discrepancy noted)

**Blockers**: None

**Next**: Execute contract test to verify current status

## 2025-10-20T14:27:00Z — Integrations: Task Assessment Complete

**Working On**: Verifying task completion status and identifying remaining work

**Progress**: Assessment complete - work needed

**Evidence**:

### Contract Test Verification ✅
- **Command**: `npx vitest run tests/integration/idea-pool.api.spec.ts`
- **Result**: **Test file does NOT exist** ❌
- **Finding**: Direction tasks have NOT been completed yet

### Integration Test Inventory:
- tests/integration/ads-workflow.spec.ts (failing - missing imports)
- tests/integration/agent-sdk-webhook.spec.ts (24 tests todo)
- tests/integration/social.api.spec.ts (7 tests passing ✓)
- **tests/integration/idea-pool.api.spec.ts**: MISSING ❌

### API Routes Inventory:
- app/routes/api.analytics.traffic.ts ✓
- app/routes/api.analytics.revenue.ts ✓
- app/routes/api.analytics.export.ts ✓
- app/routes/api.analytics.conversion-rate.ts ✓
- **app/routes/api.analytics.idea-pool.ts**: MISSING ❌

### Analysis:
- Previous feedback referenced Issue #113 as complete
- Current direction shows Issue #110 with unfulfilled tasks
- **Conclusion**: Need to execute Issue #110 tasks from direction v2.0

### Tasks from Direction (Issue #110):
1. ❌ Create idea pool API route (app/routes/api.analytics.idea-pool.ts)
2. ❌ Create contract test (tests/integration/idea-pool.api.spec.ts)
3. ⚠️ Feature flag documentation (exists in artifacts/ but may need update)
4. ❌ Contract test must pass
5. ❌ DoD checks (fmt, lint, test:ci, scan)

**Blockers**: None

**Next**: Begin executing Issue #110 tasks - create idea pool route and contract test

- Test coverage:
  1. Returns fixture data by default (feature flag disabled)
  2. Validates exactly 5 ideas structure
  3. Validates exactly 1 wildcard requirement
  4. Validates idea types (launch, evergreen, wildcard)
  5. Validates status values (draft, approved, pending_review, rejected)
  6. Validates priority values (low, medium, high, urgent)
  7. Validates projected metrics structure with number types
  8. Validates Supabase linkage structure
  9. Acknowledges feature flag when enabled (with fallback message)
  10. Supports FEATURE_FLAG_ legacy prefix
  11. Returns valid response on error (graceful degradation)
  12. Includes ISO 8601 timestamp
  13. Matches fixture data structure exactly

### Task 3: Feature Flag Documentation ✅

```
 ✓ tests/integration/idea-pool.api.spec.ts (13 tests) 20ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  13 passed (13)
   Start at  08:32:05
   Duration  864ms
```

### Task 5: DoD Checks ✅

**Formatting**: ✅ PASS
```bash
npm run fmt
# Result: app/routes/api.analytics.idea-pool.ts 6ms (unchanged)
#         docs/runbooks/idea-pool-feature-flag-activation.md 9ms
#         tests/integration/idea-pool.api.spec.ts 10ms
```

**Linting**: ✅ PASS
```bash
npx eslint app/routes/api.analytics.idea-pool.ts tests/integration/idea-pool.api.spec.ts
# Result: No errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)
```
