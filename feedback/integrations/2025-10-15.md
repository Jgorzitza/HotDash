## Process (Manager-Controlled Git)
- Do NOT run git add/commit/push/checkout/merge
- Work only in allowed paths; document evidence
- When a task is done, add the block below

```
## WORK COMPLETE - READY FOR PR
Summary: <what you built>
Files: <list>
Tests: <summary>
Evidence: <links/notes>
```

## Status Summary
