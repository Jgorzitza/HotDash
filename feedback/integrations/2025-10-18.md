# 2025-10-18

## Plan
- Execute docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md tasks (docs alignment, direction review, feedback logging).
- Locate lane molecules in reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json and derive actionable work; note blockers if unavailable.
- Prepare artifacts (MCP logs, tasks.todo files, test plan) supporting Issue #110 constraints.

## Log
- 2025-10-19T05:15:25Z — Started startup checklist; skimmed NORTH_STAR, OPERATING_MODEL, RULES, and integrations direction.
- 2025-10-19T05:16:09Z — Attempted to read reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json for lane molecules; file missing, logging blocker and continuing with documented constraints.
- 2025-10-19T05:16:56Z — Created MCP evidence file artifacts/integration/2025-10-18/mcp/startup.jsonl and initialized artifact directories per startup checklist.
- 2025-10-19T05:17:01Z — Added tasks.todo.md and tasks.todo.json outlining integration tasks and recorded blocker for missing lane molecules artifact.
- 2025-10-19T05:17:12Z — Logged blocker details in artifacts/integration/2025-10-18/BLOCKER_lane_molecules.json pending manager guidance.
- 2025-10-19T05:17:30Z — Tool check: no MCP invocations required yet; will route all API/graph operations through MCP servers when work begins.
- 2025-10-19T05:18:33Z — Received directive to complete full task list without stopping; resuming with plan execution.
- 2025-10-19T05:19:06Z — Attempt to fetch GitHub Issue #110 via MCP github-official failed (tool call error).
- 2025-10-19T05:27:23Z — Implemented server feature flag utilities and idea pool analytics route with Supabase fallback mocks; added contract tests.
- 2025-10-19T05:29:01Z — Documented idea pool Supabase activation steps in docs/specs/analytics_pipeline.md.
- 2025-10-19T05:30:05Z — Ran npm run fmt via heartbeat (artifacts/integration/2025-10-18/heartbeat/foreground-*.ndjson).
- 2025-10-19T05:31:09Z — Ran npm run lint via heartbeat (artifacts/integration/2025-10-19/heartbeat/foreground-20251019T053051Z.ndjson).
- 2025-10-19T05:31:37Z — npm run test:ci via heartbeat timed out at ~12s; retrying with extended timeout.
- 2025-10-19T07:20:14Z — Re-ran npm run fmt via heartbeat (artifacts/integration/2025-10-19/heartbeat/run-2025-10-19T01_20_10-06_00.out.log).
- 2025-10-19T07:21:05Z — Playwright config adjusted to allow mock-mode suite; npm run test:ci remains blocked (No tests found) per instructions.

### Shutdown — 01:21 (local time)

**Status**

- Task / Issue: #110 — PR: n/a — Branch: n/a
- DoD completion: ~40% (API/feature flag/docs delivered; CI partially outstanding)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Added Supabase-gated idea pool analytics route, schemas, and contract tests with mock fallback.
  - Documented activation steps and updated feature flag utilities.
  - Ran fmt/lint; test:ci attempts blocked at Playwright "No tests found" per instruction to stop.

**Evidence**

- Tests/logs/screens: artifacts/integration/2025-10-19/heartbeat/run-2025-10-19T01_20_10-06_00.out.log (fmt), foreground-20251019T053051Z.ndjson (lint), foreground-20251019T053149Z.ndjson & foreground-20251019T053425Z.ndjson (test:ci failures)
- Tool calls (MCP/adapters) used: github-official/get_issue (failed), scripts/policy/with-heartbeat.sh (multiple invocations)

**Blockers**

- Lane molecules artifact (`reports/manager/lanes/2025-10-19.json`) missing → **owner**: manager — **ETA**: pending new artifact
- `npm run test:ci` → Playwright suite exits "No tests found"; manager instructed to stop further test runs → **owner**: manager/integration (needs guidance to resume) — **ETA**: when test list provided

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**

1. Obtain updated lane molecules artifact or replacement plan to continue molecules workflow.
2. Coordinate on Playwright suite expectations, then rerun `npm run test:ci` and `npm run scan` once authorized.

**Self-grade (1–5)**

- Progress vs DoD: 2
- Evidence quality: 3
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 4
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 3
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 3

**Retrospective**

- 2–3 things I did well today:
  1. Delivered feature-flagged idea pool API with mock fallback to protect production.
  2. Captured blocker artifacts and evidence, including heartbeat logs for CI runs.
- 1–2 things to do differently tomorrow:
  1. Resolve Playwright config earlier before long CI attempts.
  2. Confirm issue metadata availability prior to diving into implementation.
- **One thing I will stop entirely:** relying on absent lane artifacts without escalating immediately.
- 2025-10-19T07:21:45Z — Attempted to post shutdown comment to Issue #110 via github-official/add_issue_comment; tool call failed.
