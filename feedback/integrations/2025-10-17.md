# Integrations — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary

- Mock Supabase contract tests passing for idea pool and experiments routes.
- Feature flag plan drafted for enabling real Supabase calls post-migration.
- Awaiting Data migration apply window before removing mocks.

## Evidence

```bash
npx vitest run tests/integration/idea-pool.api.spec.ts
```

## Blockers / Risks

- Data migrations not yet applied → keep mocks active.
- Publer adapter depends on Ads metrics slice completion.

## Next Steps

1. Coordinate with Data on migration apply schedule.
2. Document flag activation steps in runbooks.
3. Prepare integration test update for live Supabase mode.
