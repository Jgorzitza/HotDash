# Integrations — Feedback — 2025-10-17

## Status Summary
- Social Publer contract tests passing with mocks (7 tests)
- Added test-only alias for "~/utils/http.server" to avoid app code changes
- Idea-pool contract established via feature-flagged placeholder route (2 tests)

## Evidence
```bash
# Integration: social routes (Publer)
npx vitest run tests/integration/social.api.spec.ts
# Output: 7 passed

# Component tiles
npx vitest run tests/unit/components/dashboard/tiles.spec.tsx
# Output: 6 passed

# Idea Pool contract
npx vitest run tests/integration/idea-pool.api.spec.ts
# Output: 2 passed (501 when disabled; 200 mocked when enabled)

# Secret scan
npm run scan
# Output: no leaks found
```

## Blockers / Risks
- Repo-wide lint failures beyond integrations scope (to be handled by eng task)
- Idea-pool live depends on Data migrations
- Allowed paths: include vitest.config.ts alias + tests/helpers in Issue to satisfy Danger

## Next Steps
1. Targeted lint sweep for owned paths; avoid repo-wide churn
2. Draft Supabase activation steps for idea-pool live mode; plan RPC integration behind flag
3. Keep e2e mocked; coordinate with Ads/Content for Publer adapter evidence

### Shutdown — 14:19 (local time)

**Status**
- Task / Issue: #110 — PR: n/a — Branch: main
- DoD completion: Partial (contract tests + docs done; scan pass; global lint outstanding)
- What changed since last entry:
  - Added test-only alias for `~/utils/http.server`; stabilized social + tiles specs
  - Implemented feature-flagged placeholder route for idea-pool + contract tests
  - Documented Publer activation and HITL guardrails in integrations docs

**Evidence**
- Tests: social.api.spec.ts (7 passed), tiles.spec.tsx (6 passed), idea-pool.api.spec.ts (2 passed)
- Secrets: gitleaks baseline scan PASS
- MCP: ./mcp/test-mcp-tools.sh — all 6 servers ready

**Blockers**
- Repo-wide lint failures beyond integrations scope — owner: manager/eng — ETA: next workday
- Idea-pool live depends on Data migrations — owner: data — ETA: per migration window
- Allowed-path alignment: include vitest.config.ts alias + tests/helpers in Issue allowed paths

**Next-start plan (first 1–2 actions)**
1. Targeted lint sweep for owned paths; leave repo-wide cleanup to dedicated task
2. Draft Supabase activation steps for idea-pool live mode; plan RPC integration behind flag

**Self-grade (1–5)**
- Progress vs DoD: 4
- Evidence quality: 5
- Alignment (North Star / Rules / Allowed paths): 4
- Tool discipline (MCP-first, no freehand, no secrets): 5
- Communication (feedback clarity & cadence): 5

Definition of Done:
- [x] Contract tests passing (social + idea-pool placeholder)
- [x] Feature flags documented (Publer, idea-pool)
- [x] Feedback updated with evidence
- [ ] Lint failures addressed (scoped follow-up)
- [x] Secret scan passes (gitleaks)

Evidence:
- social.api.spec.ts: 7 passed
- tiles.spec.tsx: 6 passed
- idea-pool.api.spec.ts: 2 passed (501 off; 200 mocked on)

Rollback plan:
- Disable FEATURE_PUBLER_LIVE and FEATURE_IDEA_POOL_LIVE to prevent live calls
- Revert placeholder route commit if needed
