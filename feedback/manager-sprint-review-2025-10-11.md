📋 Direction: docs/directions/engineer-sprint-llamaindex-agentsdk.md (Phase 2)

🎯 OBJECTIVE: Deploy LlamaIndex as HTTP MCP server on Fly.io

**Coordination with AI Agent:**
- AI agent has delivered: evaluation dataset, training schemas, monitoring strategy
- AI agent ready to: review your implementation, optimize performance
- Daily sync via: @ai mentions in feedback files

**Implementation Steps** (from your direction doc):

1. **Scaffold MCP Server** (30 min)
   - Create `apps/llamaindex-mcp-server/` directory structure
   - Install dependencies: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, express, zod
   - Set up TypeScript config

2. **Implement MCP Protocol Handler** (2-3 hours)
   - Wrap existing `scripts/ai/llama-workflow/dist/cli.js`
   - Implement 3 tool handlers: query, refresh, insight
   - Use thin wrapper approach (execSync)

3. **Deploy to Fly.io** (1 hour)
   - Create fly.toml (512MB, auto-stop)
   - Set secrets: OPENAI_API_KEY, SUPABASE_URL
   - Deploy and verify health

4. **Update MCP Config** (15 min)
   - Add to `.mcp.json` as HTTP endpoint
   - Test from Cursor with example query
   - Document in feedback/engineer.md

**Success Criteria**:
- MCP server responds <500ms P95
- Accessible from Cursor and Agent SDK
- Health checks passing
- All 3 tools functional

**AI Agent Support**:
- Tag @ai for performance optimization
- Request code review of handlers
- Coordinate on monitoring setup

⏱️ **Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 hours (can spread over 2 days)
