# DevOps Feedback — 2025-10-21

## 2025-10-21T01:05:00Z — DevOps: STARTUP COMPLETE

**Working On**: Agent startup checklist execution (docs/runbooks/agent_startup_checklist.md)

**Progress**: ✅ COMPLETE - All 5 sections verified, ready for work

**Evidence**:

### Section 0: Git Setup (60 sec)
- Branch: manager-reopen-20251020 ✓
- Working directory: /home/justin/HotDash/hot-dash
- Status: Some uncommitted changes (inventory files, feedback files)

### Section 1: MCP Tools Verification (90 sec)
- Fly MCP: Available (used fly-status for health checks)
- Context7 MCP: Attempted flyctl lookup (not in Context7, using Fly MCP tools instead)
- Evidence format: Will log all MCP tool usage with timestamps

### Section 2: Canon Review (5 min)
- ✅ docs/RULES.md: MCP mandatory, database safety, no ad-hoc files
- ✅ docs/NORTH_STAR.md: HITL by default, tool-first intelligence
- ✅ docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md: Daily branch model, file ownership, no ad-hoc docs

### Section 3: Direction & Project Plan (5 min)
- ✅ docs/directions/devops.md: **STANDBY MODE** - All tasks complete
  - P0 Chatwoot migrations: RESOLVED (Option 1 executed)
  - Current focus: Monitor infrastructure, await Phase 3+ assignments
- ✅ docs/manager/PROJECT_PLAN.md: 13-phase Option A plan reviewed
  - Phase 1: COMPLETE ✓
  - DevOps role: Deployment support, database migration coordination, monitoring

### Section 4: Tools & Environment (5 min)
- ✅ Fly CLI: v0.3.195 (authenticated as jgorzitza@outlook.com)
- ✅ hotdash-staging: HEALTHY
  - Version: 71
  - Machine: d8dd9eea046d08 (patient-wood-2603)
  - State: started
  - Region: ord
  - Host status: ok
- ✅ hotdash-chatwoot: HEALTHY
  - Version: 15
  - Machines: 2 (web + worker)
  - Health check: PASSING ("queue_services":"ok","data_services":"ok")
  - State: started
- ⚠️ vault/ directory: Not accessible at expected path (will escalate if credentials needed)

### Section 5: Work Protocol (5 min)
- ✅ Database safety: fly.toml release_command = "npx prisma generate" ONLY (no migrations)
- ✅ Evidence logging: Timestamps + summaries (max 10 lines per command, no verbose outputs)
- ✅ Credential protocol: Check vault → report if missing → move to next task

**Blockers**: None

**Next**: Monitor infrastructure health, standby for Phase 3 deployment support or new direction from Manager

- Database migration coordination (if/when Data migrations ready)
- Infrastructure monitoring and health checks

**Compliance**:
- Using Fly MCP tools (minimum 4+ calls per session)
- Evidence logged as summaries (not verbose)
