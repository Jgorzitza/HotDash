## Startup & Activation

**13:51 UTC** — Agent startup initiated  
**13:55 UTC** — Status changed to ACTIVE with concrete tasks

### Direction Summary
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Objective:** Design Knowledge Base Structure and Learning Pipeline
- **Branch:** `agent/ai-knowledge/kb-design`
- **Allowed paths:** `docs/specs/knowledge_base_design.md, feedback/ai-knowledge/*`

### Tasks Assigned
1. ✅ Create feedback file
2. ✅ Design KB structure in `docs/specs/knowledge_base_design.md`
3. ✅ Design learning extraction pipeline
4. ✅ Define quality metrics for KB articles
5. ⏳ Create PR

## Work Log

### 13:55 UTC — Starting KB Design Spec

Creating comprehensive knowledge base design.

### 14:00 UTC — KB Design Spec Completed

✅ Created `docs/specs/knowledge_base_design.md` (300 lines)

**What was designed:**

1. **KB Article Schema** - Core content, quality metrics, grading, search embeddings
2. **Learning Edits Table** - Tracks AI draft vs human final, edit analysis
3. **Recurring Issues Table** - Pattern detection, resolution tracking
4. **Learning Extraction Pipeline** - Draft → Review → Learn workflow
5. **Knowledge Retrieval System** - Semantic search, context injection
6. **Quality Metrics** - Per-article and system-wide with targets
7. **Update Triggers & Maintenance** - Automatic updates, archival
8. **Integration Points** - ai-customer, approvals, Chatwoot
9. **Implementation Phases** - 4-week phased approach
10. **Success Criteria & Rollback** - Clear DoD and rollback plan

**Key Decisions:**
- Confidence-based filtering (≥ 0.60)
- Weighted formula: success (40%) + accuracy (30%) + tone (20%) + policy (10%)
- Semantic search via OpenAI embeddings
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)

**Alignment with North Star:**
✅ "Agents propose; humans approve/correct; system learns"
✅ HITL grading drives learning
✅ Evidence-based with audit trail

**Open Questions:**
1. Confirm OpenAI text-embedding-3-small?
2. Adjust confidence formula weights?
3. Manual review SLA?
4. Archival threshold (90 days)?
5. When to activate KB in ai-customer?

### 14:10 UTC — Committing Work
