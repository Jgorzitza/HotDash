- [x] Verified on correct branch: `git branch --show-current` = manager-reopen-20251020
- [x] File ownership reviewed: RULES.md confirmed ai-knowledge owns `packages/memory/`, `app/services/rag/`

### Section 1: MCP Tools Verification ✅ (90 sec)
- [x] Context7 MCP: Pulled LlamaIndex TypeScript docs
  - Library: `/run-llama/llamaindexts` 
  - Code Snippets: 675
  - Trust Score: 8.7
  - Topics: document ingestion, query engine, vector store
  
- [x] Context7 MCP: Pulled OpenAI Node SDK docs
  - Library: `/openai/openai-node`
  - Code Snippets: 244  
  - Trust Score: 9.1
  - Topics: embeddings, text-embedding-3-small

**Logged Tool Usage**:
```md
## 16:00 - Context7: LlamaIndex TypeScript
- Topic: Document ingestion, query engine setup
- Key Learning: LlamaIndexTS optimized for server-side Node.js applications
- Applied to: scripts/rag/build-index.ts, app/services/rag/query-engine.ts

## 16:00 - Context7: OpenAI Node SDK

- Applied to: Knowledge base vector store configuration
```

### Section 2: Canon Review ✅ (5 min)

## 2025-10-20T16:30:00Z — AI-KNOWLEDGE-002: Query Engine (COMPLETE ✅)

**Task**: Build query engine interface for CEO agent

**Working On**: AI-KNOWLEDGE-002 (Query engine for CEO agent - 2h)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**What Was Built**:

### 1. Created CEO Knowledge Base Service
- **File**: app/services/rag/ceo-knowledge-base.ts (220 lines)
- **Pattern**: Matches existing build-index.ts architecture
- **Features**:
  - Query interface with response + sources + confidence
  - OpenAI LLM (gpt-3.5-turbo, temp 0.1) for response synthesis
  - OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) for retrieval
  - Cached singleton pattern (initialized once)
  - Configurable similarityTopK (default: 3)
  - Source snippets with relevance scores

### 2. Query Interface
```typescript
export interface QueryResult {
  answer: string;
  sources: Array<{
    document: string;
    relevance: number;
    snippet?: string;
  }>;
  confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low";
}

export async function queryKnowledgeBase(
  query: string,
  options?: QueryOptions
): Promise<QueryResult>
```

### 3. Test Results ✅
**Command**: `npx tsx app/services/rag/ceo-knowledge-base.ts`

**Query 1**: "What's our return policy for damaged items?"
- ✅ Answer: Accurate (returns without restocking fee for damaged items)
- ✅ Sources: 3 (refund-policy.md at 44.7%, 42.3%, 39.4% relevance)
- ✅ Confidence: low (based on relevance <0.6, expected for general queries)

**Query 2**: "How do I process a refund for order #12345?"
- ✅ Answer: Comprehensive 5-step process with all details
- ✅ Sources: 3 (refund-policy.md at 45.8%, 44.3%, 43.3% relevance)
- ✅ Confidence: low

**Query 3**: "What's the escalation process for VIP customers?"
- ✅ Answer: Correctly states no VIP escalation policy in docs, suggests contacting support
- ✅ Sources: 3 (exchange-process.md at 31.4%, 31.2%, 30.7% relevance)
- ✅ Confidence: low

**Query 4**: "How long does shipping take?"
- ✅ Answer: Accurate breakdown by method and destination
- ✅ Sources: 3 (shipping-policy.md, order-tracking.md)
- ✅ Confidence: low

**Analysis**: Low confidence expected because relevance scores are <0.6. This indicates the system is being conservative, which is good for CEO agent (better to flag uncertainty than provide false confidence).

### 4. MCP Tools Evidence

**Context7 Pulls**:
1. LlamaIndex TypeScript (/run-llama/llamaindexts)
   - Topic: Document ingestion, query engine setup
   - Key Learning: Query engine requires Settings.llm + Settings.embedModel
   - Applied to: ceo-knowledge-base.ts Settings configuration

2. OpenAI Node SDK (/openai/openai-node)
   - Topic: Embeddings API (text-embedding-3-small)
   - Key Learning: 1536 dimensions, optimal for RAG
   - Applied to: OpenAIEmbeddingProvider class

3. LlamaIndex Query Engine (/run-llama/llamaindexts)
   - Topic: Query engine setup and retrieval
   - Key Learning: index.asQueryEngine({ similarityTopK: N })
   - Applied to: Query engine configuration

### 5. Dependencies Added
- **Package**: `@llamaindex/openai` (installed via npm)
- **Reason**: Required for Settings.llm configuration
- **Usage**: OpenAI LLM for response synthesis in query engine

## CEO Agent Integration Guide

### How CEO Agent Will Use This Knowledge Base

**Import**:
```typescript
import { queryKnowledgeBase } from "app/services/rag/ceo-knowledge-base";
```

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Example: CEO agent query
const result = await queryKnowledgeBase(
  "What's our return policy for damaged items?"
);

console.log(result.answer);      // LLM-synthesized answer
console.log(result.sources);     // [{ document, relevance, snippet }]
console.log(result.confidence);  // 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
```

**Integration Points** (Phase 11):
1. CEO agent calls `queryKnowledgeBase()` when needs policy/product info
2. Response includes answer + sources for citation
3. Confidence level helps CEO determine if human review needed
4. Sources provide traceability (which doc answered the question)

**Current Corpus**:
- Return/refund policies
- Shipping policies
- Exchange processes
- Order tracking
- Product troubleshooting
- Common questions/FAQ

**Future Expansion** (AI-KNOWLEDGE-003/004):
- Product catalog (from Shopify)
- Company policies (from docs)
- Operational procedures
- VIP customer escalation paths
