      "question": "UI component implementation and design patterns",
      "answer": "The implementation and design patterns for the UI components, particularly the PII Card and the CX Escalation Modal, follow specific guidelines and requirements as outlined in the sources.\n### PII Card Component\n1. **Structure**:\n   - The PII Card displays full customer details and is designed to be operator-only, ensuring that sensitive information is not sent to the customer. It includes sections for order details, customer contact, shipping address, tracking information, and line items [Source 3].\n2. **Design Requirements**:\n   - The component utilizes Polaris design tokens for consistency in colors, spacing, and typography. A prominent yellow warning banner indicates that the information is operator-only [Source 2][Source 3].\n   - Accessibility features are integrated, including ARIA roles and labels, ensuring compliance with WCAG AA standards [Source 2][Source 3].\n3. **Masking Functions**:\n   - Functions are implemented to mask sensitive information (e.g., email, phone, address) to ensure that only necessary details are visible [Source 11]. This includes specific formatting for each type of information to maintain privacy while still providing useful data to operators.\n### CX Escalation Modal\n1. **UI Layout**:\n   - The modal features a split layout with two sections: a Public Reply section and a PII Card section. This layout is responsive, stacking vertically on mobile devices [Source 1].\n   - The modal includes a draft reply text area, validation logic to prevent unmasked PII in public replies, and clear error messaging if validation fails [Source 1].\n2. **Accessibility**:\n   - The modal ensures focus management, allowing users to navigate using the keyboard. It also includes ARIA labels and manages focus trapping to keep the user within the modal until it is closed [Source 1].\n3. **Visual Design**:\n   - The design adheres to established visual guidelines, ensuring no regressions from previous phases. The use of Polaris components like buttons and data tables ensures a consistent user experience [Source 1][Source 4].\n### Conclusion\nThe implementation of the PII Card and CX Escalation Modal follows a structured approach that emphasizes accessibility, responsive design, and adherence to visual design standards. The use of Polaris components and specific masking functions ensures that sensitive information is handled appropriately while providing a functional interface for operators.",
